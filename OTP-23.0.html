        release_note: "*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***\n\nA new module erpc has been introduced in the kernel application. The erpc module implements an enhanced subset of the operations provided by the rpc module. Enhanced in the sense that it makes it possible to distinguish between returned value, raised exceptions, and other errors. erpc also has better performance and scalability than the original rpc implementation. This by utilizing the newly introduced spawn_request() BIF. Also the rpc module benefits from these improvements by utilizing erpc when it is possible.\n\nThis change has been marked as a potential incompatibility since rpc:block_call() now only is guaranteed to block other block_call() operations. The documentation previously claimed that it would block all rpc operations. This has however never been the case. It previously did not block node-local block_call() operations.\n\n"

A new table option decentralized_counters has therefore been added. It is default true for ordered_set with write_concurrency enabled and default false for all other table types.\n\n"

To achieve this a couple of new options to the inet distribution has been added.\n\n-- -dist_listen false -- Setup the distribution channel, but do not listen for incoming connection. This is useful when you want to use the current node to interact with another node on the same machine without it joining the entire cluster.\n\n-- -erl_epmd_port Port -- Configure a default port that the built-in EPMD client should return. This allows the local node to know the port to connect to for any other node in the cluster.\n\nThe erl_epmd callback API has also been extended to allow returning -1 as the creation which means that a random creation will be created by the node.\n\nIn addition a new callback function called listen_port_please has been added that allows the callback to return which listen port the distribution should use. This can be used instead of inet_dist_listen_min/max if the listen port is to be fetched from an external service.\n\n"

        release_note: "*** HIGHLIGHT ***\n\nThe possibility to run Erlang distribution without relying on EPMD has been extended. To achieve this a couple of new options to the inet distribution has been added.\n\n-- -dist_listen false -- Setup the distribution channel, but do not listen for incoming connection. This is useful when you want to use the current node to interact with another node on the same machine without it joining the entire cluster.\n\n-- -erl_epmd_port Port -- Configure a default port that the built-in EPMD client should return. This allows the local node to know the port to connect to for any other node in the cluster.\n\nThe erl_epmd callback API has also been extended to allow returning -1 as the creation which means that a random creation will be created by the node.\n\nIn addition a new callback function called listen_port_please has been added that allows the callback to return which listen port the distribution should use. This can be used instead of inet_dist_listen_min/max if the listen port is to be fetched from an external service.\n\n"
