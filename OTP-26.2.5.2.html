        release_note: "When no time warp mode was enabled, a smaller Erlang monotonic time could be read than a previously read time, i.e., breaking the monotonic property. The runtime system will abort when detecting an issue like this since OTP 24.3.4.17 and OTP 25.0.\n\nUp until OTP 25 no time warp mode is the default. As of OTP 26 multi time warp mode is the default.\n\n"
