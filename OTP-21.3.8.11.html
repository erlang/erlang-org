        release_note: "A literal area could prematurely be released before all uses of it had been removed. This occurred either when a terminating process had a complex exit reason referring to a literal that concurrently was removed, or when a terminating process continued executing a dirty NIF accessing a literal (via the heap) that concurrently was removed.\n\n"

        release_note: "Fix bug where the receive marker used by the runtime to do the receive queue optimization could be incorrectly set. The symptom of this would be that a message that should match in a receive never matches.\n\nThe bug requires the OTP-22 compiler and multiple selective receives to trigger. See OTP-16219 for details about the bug fix in the compiler.\n\n"

        release_note: "Fixed bug causing crash of VM built with configuration --enable--sharing-preserving. Provoked when a sent message contains both a bit string and the heap binary (< 65 bytes) which the bit string was matched from. Bug exists since OTP-19.0 but has seen to be easier to provoke since OTP-22.1.\n\n"
