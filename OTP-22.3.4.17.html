        type: " --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---"
        release_note: "Fixed a bug in the timer implementation which could cause timers that were set to more than 37.25 hours in the future to be delayed. This could occur if there were multiple timers scheduled to be triggered very close in time, but still at different times, and the scheduler thread handling the timers was not able to handle them quickly enough. Delayed timers were in this case triggered when another unrelated timer was triggered.\n\n"
