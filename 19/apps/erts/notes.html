	    Improved dirty scheduler support. A purge of a module can
	    now be performed without having to wait for completion of
	    all ongoing dirty NIF calls.</p>
          <p>
	    Note that when enabling support for dirty schedulers, a
	    new purge strategy will as of ERTS version 8.1 be
	    enabled. This new strategy is not fully backwards
	    compatible with the strategy used by default. For more
	    information see the documentation of <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erlang.html#check_process_code-3"><span class="code">erlang:check_process_code/3</span></a></span>.</p>

	    A new purge strategy has been introduced. The new
	    strategy will by default be disabled during the OTP 19
	    release, but will be the only strategy available as of
	    the OTP 20 release.</p>
          <p>
	    The new strategy is slightly incompatible with the
	    strategy being used by default in OTP 19. Using the
	    default strategy, processes holding <span class="code">fun</span>s that
	    refer to the module being purged either fail a soft
	    purge, or will be killed during a hard purge. The new
	    strategy completely ignores <span class="code">fun</span>s. If <span class="code">fun</span>s
	    referring to the code being purged exist, and are used
	    after a purge, an exception will be raised upon usage.
	    That is, the behavior will be exactly the same as the
	    case when a <span class="code">fun</span> is received by a process after the
	    purge.</p>
          <p>
	    The new strategy can optionally be enabled when building
	    OTP during OTP 19, and will automatically be enabled if
	    the runtime system is built with support for dirty
	    schedulers.</p>

	    The tracing support has been extended to allow a <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erl_tracer.html">tracer module</a></span> to be the
	    trace event handler instead of a process or port. The
	    <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erl_tracer.html">tracer module</a></span>
	    makes it possible for trace tools to filter or manipulate
	    trace event data without the trace event first having to

	    Add microstate accounting</p>
          <p>
	    Microstate accounting is a way to track which state the
	    different threads within ERTS are in. The main usage area
	    is to pin point performance bottlenecks by checking which
	    states the threads are in and then from there figuring
	    out why and where to optimize.</p>
          <p>
	    Since checking whether microstate accounting is on or off
	    is relatively expensive only a few of the states are
	    enabled by default and more states can be enabled through
	    configure.</p>
          <p>
	    There is a convenience module called msacc that has been
	    added to runtime_tools that can assist in gathering and
	    interpreting the data from Microstate accounting.</p>
          <p>
	    For more information see <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erlang.html#statistics_microstate_accounting">erlang:statistics(microstate_accounting, _)</a></span> and the <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/msacc.html">msacc</a></span> module in

	    sharing, within the process, when communication with
	    other processes in the Erlang node. There is a trade-off,
	    the copy is more costly but this cost can be reclaimed if
	    there is a lot of sharing in the message. In addition
	    literals will not be copied in a send except during a
	    purge phase of the module where the literals are located.

          <p>
	    The perf_counter is a very very cheap and high resolution
	    timer that can be used to timestamp system events. It
	    does not have monoticity guarantees, but should on most
	    OS's expose a monotonous time.</p>

	    Support for a fragmented young heap generation. That is,
	    the young heap generation can consist of multiple non
	    continuous memory areas. The main reason for this change
	    is to avoid extra copying of messages that could not be
	    allocated directly on the receivers heap.</p>

	    Erlang linked-in driver can now force the call to
	    open_port to block until a call to erl_drv_init_ack is
	    made inside the driver. This is useful when you want to
	    do some asynchronous initialization, for example getting
	    configuration from a pipe, and you want the initial
	    open_port call to fail if the configuration is incomplete
	    or wrong. See the erl_driver documentation for more
	    details on the API.</p>

	    The functionality behind <span class="code">erlang:open_port/2</span> when
	    called with spawn or spawn_executable has been redone so
	    that the forking of the new program is done in a separate
	    process called erl_child_setup. This allows for a much
	    more robust implementation that uses less memory and does
	    not block the entire emulator if the program to be
	    started is on an un-accessible NFS. Benchmarks have shown
	    this approach to be about 3-5 times as fast as the old
	    approach where the fork/vfork was done by erts. This is a
	    pure stability and performance fix, however some error
	    messages may have changed, which is why it is marked as a
	    backwards incompatible change.</p>

          <p>
	    This rewrite does not break any backwards

	    It should be noted that this only applies to trace

	    may also be effected by this.</p>
          <p>
	    Trace messages are only guaranteed to be ordered from one
	    traced process or port. In previous releases this was not
	    visible as a <span class="code">'send'</span> trace message would always
	    arrive before the corresponding <span class="code">'receive'</span> trace
	    message that is no longer always the case. This also
	    means that timestamped trace messages may seem to arrive

	    A process could end up in an inconsistent half exited

	    Changed default OS monotonic clock source chosen at build

	    monotonic time stops when the system is suspended.</p>
          <p>
	    If you prefer that monotonic time elapse during suspend
	    of the machine, you can pass the command line argument
	    <span class="code">--enable-prefer-elapsed-monotonic-time-during-suspend</span>
	    to <span class="code">configure</span> when building Erlang/OTP. The
	    configuration stage will try to find such a clock source,
	    but might not be able to find it. Note that there might
	    be a performance penalty associated with such a clock
	    source.</p>

	    Use persistent hashmaps for large Maps</p>
          <p>Maps will use a

          <p>Semantics of Maps have changed in two incompatible

	    Scalability improvement for <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erlang.html#make_ref-0">erlang:make_ref/0</a></span>,
	    and other functionality that create references. Each
	    scheduler now manage its own set of references. By this
	    no communication at all is needed when creating
	    references.</p>
          <p>
	    Previous implementation generated a strictly
	    monotonically increasing sequence of references
	    corresponding to creation time on the runtime system
	    instance. This is <strong>not</strong> the case with current
	    implementation. You can only expect reference to be
	    unique. The Erlang/OTP documentation has never mentioned
	    anything else but the uniqueness property, so this change
	    <strong>is</strong> fully compatible. The only reason we've
	    marked this as a potential incompatibility is since an
	    early draft for an Erlang specification mentions strict
	    monotonicity as a property.</p>
          <p>
	    If you need to create data with a strict monotonicity
	    property use <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erlang.html#unique_integer-1">erlang:unique_integer([monotonic])</a></span>.

	    Optimization of timers internally in the VM. This include
	    process timers (<span class="code">receive ... after</span>), port timers
	    (<span class="code">driver_set_timer()</span>) as well as BIF timers
	    (<span class="code">erlang:send_after()</span>/<span class="code">erlang:start_timer()</span>).</p>
          <p>
	    Each scheduler thread now has its own lock-free timer
	    service instead of one locked central service. This
	    dramatically improves performance of timer management on
	    systems with a large amount of schedulers and timers.</p>
          <p>
	    The timer service internal data structure has also been
	    optimized to be able to handle more timers than before.
	    That is, each timer service is by its self able to handle
	    more timers without dramatic performance loss than the
	    old centralized timer service.</p>
          <p>
	    The API of BIF timers has also been extended. Timeout
	    values are for example no longer limited to 32-bit
	    integers. For more information see the documentation of
	    <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erlang.html#start_timer-4"><span class="code">erlang:start_timer/4</span></a></span>,

          <p>
	    Characteristics impact: Calls to the synchronous versions
	    of <span class="code">erlang:cancel_timer()</span>, and
	    <span class="code">erlang:read_timer()</span> may take substantially longer
	    time to complete than before. This occur when the timer
	    that is accessed is managed by a remote scheduler. You
	    typically want to use the new asynchronous option in
	    order to avoid blocking the calling process.</p>

	    This solves the following problems with the old

          <p>
	    It doesn't block when the TCP peer is idle or slow. This
	    is the expected behaviour when shutdown() is called: the
	    caller needs to be able to continue reading from the
	    socket, not be prevented from doing so.</p>
          <p>
	    It doesn't truncate the output. The current version of
	    gen_tcp:shutdown/2 will truncate any outbound data in the
	    driver queue after about 10 seconds if the TCP peer is
	    idle of slow. Worse yet, it doesn't even inform anyone
	    that the data has been truncated: 'ok' is returned to the
	    caller; and a FIN rather than an RST is sent to the TCP
	    peer.</p>

	    Introduced delayed node table GC. This in order to avoid

	    During a crashdump all file descriptors are closed to
	    ensure the closing of the epmd port and to reserve a file
	    descriptor for the crashdump file.</p>
          <p>
	    If a driver (third party library) cannot handle closing
	    of sockets this could result in a segmentation fault in
	    which case a crashdump would not be produced. This is now
	    fixed by only closing inets sockets via an emergency
	    close callback to the driver and thus closing the epmd
	    socket.</p>

	    <p>Introduced support for eager check I/O.</p>
	    <p>By default eager check I/O will be disabled, but this

	    I/O is enabled, schedulers will more frequently check for
	    I/O work. Outstanding I/O operations will however not be

	    disabled.</p>
	    <p>Eager check I/O can be enabled using the <span class="code">erl</span>
	    command line argument: <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erl.html#+secio"><span class="code">+secio true</span></a></span></p>

	    <p>A bug in the VM code implementing sending of signals

	    to the NIF API.</p>
          <p>
	    The <span class="code">enif_schedule_nif()</span> function allows a
	    long-running NIF to be broken into separate NIF
	    invocations without the help of a wrapper function
	    written in Erlang. The NIF first executes part of the
	    long-running task, then calls <span class="code">enif_schedule_nif()</span>
	    to schedule a NIF for later execution to continue the
	    task. Any number of NIFs can be scheduled in this manner,
	    one after another. Since the emulator regains control
	    between invocations, this helps avoid problems caused by
	    native code tying up scheduler threads for too long.</p>
          <p>
	    The <span class="code">enif_schedule_nif()</span> function also replaces the
	    <span class="code">enif_schedule_dirty_nif()</span> in the experimental
	    dirty NIF API. Note that the only incompatible changes

	    The option dupnames did not work as intended in re. When

	    Increase garbage collection tenure rate</p>
	    <p>The garbage collector tries to maintain the previous
	    heap block size during a minor gc, i.e. 'need' is not
	    utilized in determining the size of the new heap, instead
	    it relies on tenure and garbage to be sufficiently
	    large.</p>
	    <p>In instances during intense growing with exclusively
	    live data on the heap coupled with delayed tenure,
	    fullsweeps would be triggered directly after a minor gc
	    to make room for 'need' since the new heap would be
	    full.</p>
	    <p>To remedy this, the tenure of terms on the minor heap
	    will always happen (if it is below the high watermark)
	    instead of every other minor gc.</p>
	    <p>Characteristics Impact: Reduced CPU-time spent in
	    garbage collection but may infer delays in collecting
	    garbage from the heap. Tweak 'fullsweep_after' options to
	    increase gc pressure if needed.</p>

	    sendfile no longer uses async threads by default</p>
          <p>
	    This has been done because a slow client attack is
	    possible if the async thread pool is used. The scenario
	    is:</p>
          <p>
	    Client does a request for a file and then slowly receives
	    the file one byte at a time. This will eventually fill
	    the async thread pool with blocking sendfile operations
	    and thus starving the vm of all file operations.</p>
          <p>
	    If you still want to use the async threads pool for
	    sendfile an option to enable it has been introduced.</p>

	    Erlang/OTP has been ported to the realtime operating
	    system OSE. The port supports both smp and non-smp
	    emulator. For details around the port and how to started
	    see the User's Guide in the <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../apps/ose/ose_intro.html">ose</a></span> application. </p>
          <p>
	    Note that not all parts of Erlang/OTP has been ported. </p>
          <p>
	    Notable things that work are: non-smp and smp emulators,
	    OSE signal interaction, crypto, asn1, run_erl/to_erl,
	    tcp, epmd, distribution and most if not all non-os
	    specific functionality of Erlang.</p>
          <p>
	    Notable things that does not work are: udp/sctp, os_mon,
	    erl_interface, binding of schedulers.</p>

	    Add the {active,N} socket option for TCP, UDP, and SCTP,
	    where N is an integer in the range -32768..32767, to
	    allow a caller to specify the number of data messages to
	    be delivered to the controlling process. Once the
	    socket's delivered message count either reaches 0 or is
	    explicitly set to 0 with inet:setopts/2 or by including
	    {active,0} as an option when the socket is created, the
	    socket transitions to passive ({active, false}) mode and
	    the socket's controlling process receives a message to
	    inform it of the transition. TCP sockets receive
	    {tcp_passive,Socket}, UDP sockets receive
	    {udp_passive,Socket} and SCTP sockets receive
	    {sctp_passive,Socket}. </p>
          <p>
	    The socket's delivered message counter defaults to 0, but
	    it can be set using {active,N} via any gen_tcp, gen_udp,
	    or gen_sctp function that takes socket options as
	    arguments, or via inet:setopts/2. New N values are added
	    to the socket's current counter value, and negative
	    numbers can be used to reduce the counter value.
	    Specifying a number that would cause the socket's counter
	    value to go above 32767 causes an einval error. If a
	    negative number is specified such that the counter value
	    would become negative, the socket's counter value is set
	    to 0 and the socket transitions to passive mode. If the
	    counter value is already 0 and inet:setopts(Socket,
	    [{active,0}]) is specified, the counter value remains at
	    0 but the appropriate passive mode transition message is
	    generated for the socket.</p>

	    A new optional scheduler utilization balancing mechanism
	    has been introduced. For more information see the
	    <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erl.html#+sub"><span class="code">+sub</span></a></span> command
	    line argument.</p>
          <p>
	    Characteristics impact: None, when not enabled. When
	    enabled, changed timing in the system, normally a small
	    overhead due to measuring of utilization and calculating
	    balancing information. On some systems, such as old
	    Windows systems, the overhead can be quite substantial.
	    This time measurement overhead highly depend on the
	    underlying primitives provided by the OS.</p>

	    A call to either the <span class="code">garbage_collect/1</span> BIF or the
	    <span class="code">check_process_code/2</span> BIF may trigger garbage
	    collection of another processes than the process calling
	    the BIF. The previous implementations performed these
	    kinds of garbage collections without considering the
	    internal state of the process being garbage collected. In
	    order to be able to more easily and more efficiently
	    implement yielding native code, these types of garbage
	    collections have been rewritten. A garbage collection
	    like this is now triggered by an asynchronous request
	    signal, the actual garbage collection is performed by the
	    process being garbage collected itself, and finalized by
	    a reply signal to the process issuing the request. Using
	    this approach processes can disable garbage collection
	    and yield without having to set up the heap in a state
	    that can be garbage collected.</p>

	    The <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erlang.html#garbage_collect-2"><span class="code">garbage_collect/2</span></a></span>,
	    and <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erlang.html#check_process_code-3"><span class="code">check_process_code/3</span></a></span>
	    BIFs have been introduced. Both taking an option list as

	    requests.</p>
          <p>
	    <span class="code">code:purge/1</span> and <span class="code">code:soft_purge/1</span> have

	    <span class="code">check_process_code</span> requests in order to

          <p>
	    Characteristics impact: A call to the
	    <span class="code">garbage_collect/1</span> BIF or the
	    <span class="code">check_process_code/2</span> BIF will normally take longer
	    time to complete while the system as a whole wont be as
	    much negatively effected by the operation as before. A
	    call to <span class="code">code:purge/1</span> and <span class="code">code:soft_purge/1</span>
	    may complete faster or slower depending on the state of
	    the system while the system as a whole wont be as much

	    erlang:binary_to_term will now cost an appropriate amount
	    of reductions and will interrupt (yield) for reschedule
	    if the term is big. This avoids too long schedules when
	    binary_to_term is used. (Thanks to Svante Karlsson for
	    the original patch)</p>
          <p>
	    Impact: Programs running binary_to_term on large binaries
	    will run more smoothly, but rescheduling will impact the
	    single process performance of the BIF. Single threaded
	    benchmarks might show degraded performance of the BIF,
	    while general system behaviour will be improved.</p>

	    Experimental "dirty scheduler" functionality has been

	    need to pass the command line argument
	    <span class="code">--enable-dirty-schedulers</span> to <span class="code">configure</span> when
	    building the system.</p>
          <p>
	    Dirty schedulers can currently only be used by NIFs on a
	    system with SMP support. More information can be found in
	    the <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erl_nif.html#dirty_nifs"><span class="code">erl_nif(3)</span></a></span>
	    documentation, the <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erl.html"><span class="code">erl(1)</span></a></span> documentation, and

          <p>
	    Note that the functionality is <strong>experimental</strong>, and
	    <strong>not supported</strong>. This functionality <strong>will</strong>

    <h4>Improvements and New Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    A new memory allocation feature called "super carrier"
	    has been introduced. The super carrier feature can be
	    used in different ways. It can for example be used for
	    pre-allocation of all memory that the runtime system
	    should be able to use.</p>
          <p>
	    By default the super carrier is disabled. It is enabled
	    by passing the <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erts_alloc.html#MMscs"><span class="code">+MMscs &lt;size in MB&gt;</span></a></span> command line argument. For more
	    information see the documentation of the <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erts_alloc.html#MMsco"><span class="code">+MMsco</span></a></span>,
	    <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erts_alloc.html#MMscrfsd"><span class="code">+MMscrfsd</span></a></span>,
	    <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erts_alloc.html#MMscrpm"><span class="code">+MMscrpm</span></a></span>,
	    <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erts_alloc.html#MMscs"><span class="code">+MMscs</span></a></span>,
	    <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erts_alloc.html#Musac"><span class="code">+MMusac</span></a></span>,
	    and, <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erts_alloc.html#Mlpm"><span class="code">+Mlpm</span></a></span>
	    command line arguments in the <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erts_alloc.html"><span class="code">erts_alloc(3)</span></a></span>
	    documentation.</p>
          <p>
	    Since it is disabled by default there should be no impact
	    on system characteristics if not used.</p>
          <p>
	    This change has been marked as a potential
	    incompatibility since the returned list when calling
	    <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erlang.html#system_info_allocator_tuple"><span class="code">erlang:system_info({allocator, mseg_alloc})</span></a></span> now also include an
	    <span class="code">{erts_mmap, _}</span> tuple as one element in the list.</p>

        <li>
	    <p> Introduced a new guarantee regarding exit signals
	    from ports: </p>
<p> If the process calling one of the
	    synchronous port BIFs listed below is linked to the port
	    identified by the first argument, and the port exits
	    before sending the result of the port operation, the exit
	    signal issued due to this link will be received by the
	    processes before the BIF returns, or fail with an
	    exception due to the port not being open. </p>
<p> The
	    synchronous port BIFs are: </p> <ul> <li><span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erlang.html#port_close-1"><span class="code">port_close/1</span></a></span></li>
	    <li><span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erlang.html#port_command-2"><span class="code">port_command/2</span></a></span></li>
	    <li><span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erlang.html#port_command-3"><span class="code">port_command/3</span></a></span></li>
	    <li><span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erlang.html#port_connect-2"><span class="code">port_connect/2</span></a></span></li>
	    <li><span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erlang.html#port_control-3"><span class="code">port_control/3</span></a></span></li>
	    <li><span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erlang.html#port_call-3"><span class="code">erlang:port_call/3</span></a></span></li>
	    <li><span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erlang.html#port_info-1"><span class="code">erlang:port_info/1</span></a></span></li>
	    <li><span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erlang.html#port_info-2"><span class="code">erlang:port_info/2</span></a></span></li>
	    </ul> <p> Note that some ports under certain
	    circumstances unlink themselves from the calling process
	    before exiting, i.e. even though the process linked
	    itself to the port there might be no link triggering an
	    exit signal. </p> <p>Characteristics impact: The return
	    or exception from the synchronous port BIF will be
	    delayed if the port simultaneously exit due to some issue
	    unrelated to the outstanding synchronous port BIF call.
	    In all other cases characteristics are unchanged. </p>

	    Add erl option to set schedulers by percentages. </p>
          <p>
	    For applications where measurements show enhanced
	    performance from the use of a non-default number of
	    emulator scheduler threads, having to accurately set the
	    right number of scheduler threads across multiple hosts
	    each with different numbers of logical processors is
	    difficult because the erl +S option requires absolute
	    numbers of scheduler threads and scheduler threads online
	    to be specified.</p>
          <p>
	    To address this issue, add a +SP option to erl, similar
	    to the existing +S option but allowing the number of
	    scheduler threads and scheduler threads online to be set
	    as percentages of logical processors configured and
	    logical processors available, respectively. For example,
	    "+SP 50:25" sets the number of scheduler threads to 50%
	    of the logical processors configured, and the number of
	    scheduler threads online to 25% of the logical processors
	    available. The +SP option also interacts with any
	    settings specified with the +S option, such that the
	    combination of options "+S 4:4 +SP 50:50" (in either
	    order) results in 2 scheduler threads and 2 scheduler
	    threads online.</p>

	    erlang:term_to_binary will now cost an appropriate amount
	    of reductions and will interrupt (yield) for reschedule
	    if the term is big. This avoids too long schedules when
	    term_to_binary is used. </p>
          <p>
	    Impact: Programs running term_to_binary on large terms
	    will run more smothly, but rescheduling will impact the
	    single process performance of the BIF. Single threaded
	    benchmarks will show degraded performance of the BIF when
	    called with very large terms, while general system
	    behaviour will be improved. The overhead for allowing
	    restart and reduction counting also degrades local
	    performance of the BIF with between 5% and 10% even for
	    small terms.</p>

	    <p>A new better algorithm for management of the process,
	    and port tables has been introduced.</p>
	    <p>Impact on the characteristics of the system:</p>
	    <ul> <li>The new algorithm ensures that both insert
	    and delete operations can be made in O(1) time
	    complexity. Previously used algorithm either caused
	    insert or delete to be O(N).</li> <li>The new
	    algorithm will also ensure that reuse of identifiers will
	    be less frequent than when the old algorithm was
	    used.</li> <li>Previously used algorithm ensured that
	    the latest created identifier compared as the largest
	    when comparing two identifiers of the same type that had
	    been created on the same node as long as no identifiers
	    had been reused. Since identifiers can be reused quite
	    fast, one has never been able to rely on this property.
	    Due to the introduction of this new algorithm this
	    property will not hold even if no identifiers has been
	    reused yet. This could be considered as an
	    incompatibility.</li> </ul>
	    <p>Due to the above mensioned potential incompatibility,
	    it will still be possible to enable the old algorithm for
	    some time. The command line argument <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erl.html#+P"><span class="code">+P legacy</span></a></span> will enable
	    the old algorithm on the process table, and <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erl.html#+Q"><span class="code">+Q legacy</span></a></span> will do the
	    same for the port table. These command line arguments are
	    however deprecated as of their introduction and have been
	    scheduled for removal in OTP-R18.</p>

    <h4>Known Bugs and Problems</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
	    <p>Miscellaneous native code in OTP misbehave either due
	    to lengthy execution, or due to not bumping reductions
	    properly. Problems typically occur when passing huge sets
	    of data to a misbehaving BIF. Fixing this has high
	    priority and is being worked on, but there will remain
	    issues like this for some time.</p>
	    <p>In order to alleviate problems with scheduling which
	    might occur when executing misbehaving native code, the
	    command line argument <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erl.html#+sfwi">+sfwi</a></span> has been
	    introduced.</p>
	    <p>By default this feature is disabled and you are
	    advised not to enable it if you do not encounter problems
	    with misbehaving native code.</p>
	    <p>When enabled it has the following impact on the
	    characteristics of the system:</p> <ul> <li>Work will
	    always be distributed between schedulers even when
	    executing misbehaving native code.</li> <li>It may
	    cause an increased amount of processes and/or ports
	    bouncing between schedulers which in turn will cause a
	    performance loss.</li> <li>It may cause reduced
	    performance due to reduced or lost work compaction when
	    all schedulers do not execute under full load.</li>
	    <li>An increased contention on run queue locks.</li>

	    A bug in the implementation of offline schedulers has
	    been fixed. The bug was introduced in OTP-R16A/ERTS-5.10,
	    and caused work-stealing between schedulers to fail. This
	    in turn, caused work to accumulate in some run-queues.
	    The bug was only triggered when there were offline
	    schedulers in the system, i.e., when the amount of online
	    schedulers was less than the total amount of schedulers.
	    The effect of the bug got more severe the larger amount
	    of offline schedulers the system had.</p>

	    <p>A bug in an ERTS internal queue implementation could
	    cause the loss of a wake up signal to a consumer thread.
	    This has now been fixed.</p>
	    <p>The effect of this bug, when triggered, was often only
	    a small or even no delay of certain operations. This
	    since, threads often are woken due to other unrelated
	    reasons. However, if the consumer thread was not woken
	    due to other reasons when the bug was triggered, these
	    operations could be left hanging, potentially for ever.
	    Such effects seems to have been very rare, but we have on
	    at least one occasion gotten a report about such an
	    issue.</p>
	    <p>Operations potentially effected by this bug:</p>
	    <dl> <dt><strong>Inspection of memory allocation
	    status</strong></dt> <dd>The Erlang process calling
	    <span class="code">erlang:memory/[0,1]</span>, or
	    <span class="code">erlang:system_info({allocator|allocator_sizes, _})</span>
	    could potentially hang waiting for responses from
	    involved threads.</dd> <dt><strong>Async thread pool
	    jobs</strong></dt> <dd>An async thread pool job request and/or
	    reply could potentially be left hanging. In OTP this only
	    effected file operations, but user implemented drivers
	    using the async thread pool were also effected. In the
	    file operation case, this would typically translate into
	    an Erlang process potentially hanging on the file
	    operation.</dd> <dt><strong>Shutting down the runtime
	    system</strong></dt> <dd>Due to the issue with the async thread
	    pool mentioned above, flushing of I/O while terminating
	    the runtime system could also potentially hang.</dd>
	    <dt><strong>ETS memory deallocation</strong></dt> <dd>Scheduled jobs
	    handling deallocation of the main structure of an ETS
	    table could potentially hang. This more or less only
	    translates into minor memory leaks.</dd> <dt><strong>Shutting

	    <p>These changes imply changes of the characteristics of

	    signal delivery</strong></dt> <dd>The previous implementation
	    of the VM has delivered signals from processes to ports
	    in a synchronous stricter fashion than required by the
	    language. As of ERTS version 5.10, signals are truly
	    asynchronously delivered. The order of signal delivery
	    still adheres to the requirements of the language, but
	    only to the requirements. That is, some signal sequences
	    that previously always were delivered in one specific
	    order may now from time to time be delivered in different
	    orders. This may cause Erlang programs that have made
	    <strong>false assumptions</strong> about signal delivery order to
	    fail even though they previously succeeded. For more
	    information about signal ordering guarantees, see the
	    chapter on <span class="bold_code"><a href="communication.html">communication</a></span> in
	    the ERTS user's guide. The <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erl.html#+n">+n</a></span> command line flag of
	    <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erl.html">erl(1)</a></span> can be
	    helpful when trying to find signaling order bugs in
	    Erlang code that have been exposed by these
	    changes.</dd> <dt><strong>Latency of signals sent from
	    processes to ports</strong></dt> <dd>Signals from processes to
	    ports where previously always delivered immediately. This
	    kept latency for such communication to a minimum, but it
	    could cause lock contention which was very expensive for
	    the system as a whole. In order to keep this latency low
	    also in the future, most signals from processes to ports
	    are by default still delivered immediately as long as no
	    conflicts occur. Such conflicts include not being able to
	    acquire the port lock, but also include other conflicts.
	    When a conflict occur, the signal will be scheduled for
	    delivery at a later time. A scheduled signal delivery may
	    cause a higher latency for this specific communication,
	    but improves the overall performance of the system since
	    it reduce lock contention between schedulers. The default
	    behavior of only scheduling delivery of these signals on
	    conflict can be changed by passing the <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erl.html#+spp">+spp</a></span> command line flag
	    to <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erl.html">erl(1)</a></span>. The

	    The runtime system will now by default use 10 async
	    threads if thread support has been enabled when building
	    the runtime system.</p>
          <p>
	    This will prevent long blocking file-operations from
	    blocking scheduler threads for long periods of time,
	    which can be harmful. Apart from file-operations, it also
	    effects other operations scheduled on the async thread
	    pool by user implemented drivers.</p>
          <p>
	    The amount of async threads can be controlled by using
	    the <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erl.html#async_thread_pool_size"><span class="code">+A</span></a></span>
	    command line argument of <span class="code">erl(1)</span>. When running some
	    offline tools you <strong>might</strong> want to disable async
	    threads, but you are advised <strong>not</strong> to in the
	    general case. Instead, you might want to increase the
	    amount of async threads used.</p>
          <p>
	    This change imply changes of the characteristics the
	    system compared to the previous default. The
	    responsiveness of the system as a whole will be improved.
	    Operations scheduled on the async thread pool will get an
	    increased latency. The throughput of these operations may
	    increase, or decrease depending on the type of the
	    operations and how they get scheduled. In the case of
	    file operations, the throughput very much depends on how
	    the Erlang application access files. Multiple concurrent
	    accesses to different files have the potential of an
	    increased throughput.</p>

	    Increased potential concurrency in ETS for

	    table locks has increased from 16 to 64. This makes it
	    four times less likely that two concurrent processes
	    writing to the same table would collide and thereby
	    serialized. The cost is an increased constant memory
	    footprint for tables using write_concurrency. The memory
	    consumption per inserted record is not affected. The
	    increased footprint can be particularly large if
	    <span class="code">write_concurrency</span> is combined with

	    Relocate bodies of DTrace probes to the statically-linked

          <p>
	    Due to various operating systems (in both the DTrace and
	    SystemTap worlds) not fully supporting DTrace probes (or
	    SystemTap-compatibility mode probes) in shared libraries,
	    we relocate those probes to the statically-linked virtual
	    machine. This could be seen as pollution of the pristine
	    VM by a (yet) experimental feature. However:</p>
          <p>
	    1. This code can be eliminated completely by the C
	    preprocessor. 2. Leaving the probes in the dyntrace NIF
	    shared library simply does not work correctly on too many
	    platforms. *Many* thanks to Macneil Shonle at Basho for
	    assisting when my RSI-injured fingers gave out. (note:

	    On Linux systems using heart (erl -heart) and a

	    even though Erlang was running fine after approx 298 to

	    times(2) is now replaced with clock_gettime(2) and the
	    CLOCK_MONOTONIC clock, resulting in a more stable
	    solution. The Erlang VM itself has used clock_gettime(2)

	    <p> When an escript ends now all printout to standard
	    output and standard error gets out on the terminal. This
	    bug has been corrected by changing the behaviour of
	    erlang:halt/0,1, which should fix the same problem for
	    other escript-like applications, i.e that data stored in
	    the output port driver buffers got lost when printing on
	    a TTY and exiting through erlang:halt/0,1. </p>
	    <p> The BIF:s erlang:halt/0,1 has gotten improved
	    semantics and there is a new BIF erlang:halt/2 to
	    accomplish something like the old semantics. See the
	    documentation. </p>
	    <p> Now erlang:halt/0 and erlang:halt/1 with an integer
	    argument will close all ports and allow all pending async
	    threads operations to finish before exiting the emulator.
	    Previously erlang:halt/0 and erlang:halt(0) would just
	    wait for pending async threads operations but not close
	    ports. And erlang:halt/1 with a non-zero integer argument
	    would not even wait for pending async threads operations.
	    </p>
	    <p> To roughly the old behaviour, to not wait for ports
	    and async threads operations when you exit the emulator,
	    you use erlang:halt/2 with an integer first argument and
	    an option list containing {flush,false} as the second
	    argument. Note that now is flushing not dependant of the
	    exit code, and you can not only flush async threads
	    operations which we deemed as a strange behaviour anyway.
	    </p>
	    <p>Also, erlang:halt/1,2 has gotten a new feature: If the
	    first argument is the atom 'abort' the emulator is
	    aborted producing a core dump, if the operating system so
	    allows. </p>

	    The ERTS internal system block functionality has been
	    replaced by new functionality for blocking the system.
	    The old system block functionality had contention issues
	    and complexity issues. The new functionality piggy-backs
	    on thread progress tracking functionality needed by newly
	    introduced lock-free synchronization in the runtime
	    system. When the functionality for blocking the system
	    isn't used, there is more or less no overhead at all.
	    This since the functionality for tracking thread progress
	    is there and needed anyway.</p>

	    thread pool, but more uses are planned for the future.</p>

	    Drivers using the driver_async functionality are not

	    As of ERTS version 5.9 (OTP-R15B) the runtime system will
	    by default <strong>not</strong> bind schedulers to logical
	    processors.</p>
          <p>
	    If the Erlang runtime system is the only operating system
	    process that binds threads to logical processors, this
	    improves the performance of the runtime system. However,
	    if other operating system processes (as for example
	    another Erlang runtime system) also bind threads to
	    logical processors, there might be a performance penalty
	    instead. In some cases this performance penalty might be
	    severe. Due to this, we change the default so that the
	    user must make an active decision in order to bind
	    schedulers.</p>

	    Several bugs concerning constant binary constructions
	    such as &lt;&lt;0:4294967295&gt;&gt; have been corrected.
	    Depending on the actual size of the binary and the type
	    of run-time system (32-bit, halfword, 64-bit), such
	    expression could either crash the run-time system or make
	    the loader refuse loading of the module.</p>

	    Replace atom in DRV macro in prim_file with string</p>
          <p>
	    An experimental version of Dialyzer discovered that the

	    calls to erlang:open_port({spawn, Driver}, Portopts) as
	    the Driver argument. The documentation states that this

	    inet: error if fd does not match socket domain</p>
          <p>
	    If an IPv4 fd is opened as an IPv6 socket, unexpected
	    behaviour can occur. For example, if an IPv4 UDP socket
	    is opened and passed into Erlang as an IPv6 socket, the
	    first 3 bytes (corresponding to 1 byte representing the
	    protocol family, 2 bytes set to the port) are stripped
	    from the payload. The cause of the UDP payload truncation
	    happens in inet_drv.c:packet_inet_input when a call to
	    inet_get_address fails silently because the family is set
	    to PF_INET6 but the buffer len is the size of an IPv4
	    struct sockaddr_in.</p>

	    Let epmd ignore empty ERL_EPMD_ADDRESS</p>
          <p>
	    If the environment variable ERL_EPMD_ADDRESS is set to
	    the empty string, empd now behaves like it does by
	    default when ERL_EPMD_ADDRESS is unset. That is, in this
	    case, epmd now listens on all available interfaces
	    instead of using only the loopback interface, which
	    happened because epmd added the loopback address to the
	    (in this case empty) list of addresses specified via
	    ERL_EPMD_ADDRESS.</p>
          <p>
	    Also, epmd now ignores ERL_EPMD_ADDRESS if it contains
	    only separator characters (comma and space).</p>

	    giving the <span class="code">--enable-halfword-emulator</span> option to
	    the <span class="code">configure</span> script.</p>
	    <p>The halfword emulator is a 64-bit application, but
	    uses halfwords (32-bit words) for all data in Erlang
	    processes, therefore using less memory and being faster
	    than the standard 64-bit emulator. The total size of all
	    BEAM code and all process data for all processes is
	    limited to 4Gb, but ETS tables and off-heap binaries are
	    only limited by the amount of available memory.</p>

	    The Erlang VM now supports Unicode filenames. The feature
	    is turned on by default on systems where Unicode
	    filenames are mandatory (Windows and MacOSX), but can be
	    enabled on other systems with the '+fnu' emulator option.
	    Enabling the Unicode filename feature on systems where it
	    is not default is however considered experimental and not
	    to be used for production. Together with the Unicode file
	    name support, the concept of "raw filenames" is
	    introduced, which means filenames provided without
	    implicit unicode encoding translation. Raw filenames are
	    provided as binaries, not lists. For further information,
	    see stdlib users guide and the chapter about using
	    Unicode in Erlang. Also see the file module manual page.</p>

	    Large parts of the <span class="code">ethread</span> library have been
	    rewritten. The <span class="code">ethread</span> library is an Erlang
	    runtime system internal, portable thread library used by
	    the runtime system itself.</p>
          <p>
	    Most notable improvement is a reader optimized rwlock
	    implementation which dramatically improve the performance
	    of read-lock/read-unlock operations on multi processor
	    systems by avoiding ping-ponging of the rwlock cache
	    lines. The reader optimized rwlock implementation is used
	    by miscellaneous rwlocks in the runtime system that are
	    known to be read-locked frequently, and can be enabled on
	    ETS tables by passing the <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/ets.html#new_2_read_concurrency">{read_concurrency, true}</a></span> option upon table creation. See the
	    documentation of <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/ets.html#new-2">ets:new/2</a></span> for more
	    information. The reader optimized rwlock implementation
	    can be fine tuned when starting the runtime system. For
	    more information, see the documentation of the <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../man/erl.html#+rg">+rg</a></span> command line argument
	    of <span class="code">erl</span>.</p>
          <p>
	    There is also a new implementation of rwlocks that is not
	    optimized for readers. Both implementations interleaves
	    readers and writers during contention as opposed to,
	    e.g., the NPTL (Linux) pthread rwlock implementation
	    which use either a reader or writer preferred strategy.
	    The reader/writer preferred strategy is problematic since
	    it starves threads doing the non-preferred operation.</p>
          <p>
	    The new rwlock implementations in general performs better
	    in ERTS than common pthread implementations. However, in
	    some extremely heavily contended cases this is not the
	    case. Such heavy contention can more or less only appear
	    on ETS tables. This when multiple processes do very large
	    amounts of write locked operations simultaneously on the
	    same table. Such use of ETS is bad regardless of rwlock
	    implementation, will never scale, and is something we
	    strongly advise against.</p>
          <p>
	    The new rwlock implementations depend on atomic
	    operations. If no native atomic implementation is found,
	    a fallback solution will be used. Using the fallback
	    implies a performance degradation. That is, it is more
	    important now than before to build OTP with a native
	    atomic implementation.</p>
          <p>
	    The <span class="code">ethread</span> library contains native atomic
	    implementations for, x86 (32 and 64 bit), powerpc (32
	    bit), sparc V9 (32 and 64 bit), and tilera (32 bit). On
	    other hardware gcc's builtin support for atomic memory
	    access will be used if such exists. If no such support is
	    found, <span class="code">configure</span> will warn about no atomic
	    implementation available.</p>
          <p>
	    The <span class="code">ethread</span> library can now also use the
	    <span class="code">libatomic_ops</span> library for atomic memory accesses.
	    This makes it possible for the Erlang runtime system to
	    utilize optimized native atomic operations on more
	    platforms than before. If <span class="code">configure</span> warns about no
	    atomic implementation available, try using the
	    <span class="code">libatomic_ops</span> library. Use the <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../installation_guide/INSTALL.html#Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP">--with-libatomic_ops=PATH</a></span>
	    <span class="code">configure</span> command line argument when specifying
	    where the <span class="code">libatomic_ops</span> installation is located.
	    The <span class="code">libatomic_ops</span> library can be downloaded from:
	    <span class="bold_code"><a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/">http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/</a></span></p>
          <p>
	    The changed API of the <span class="code">ethread</span> library has also
	    caused modifications in the Erlang runtime system.
	    Preparations for the to come "delayed deallocation"
	    feature has also been done since it depends on the
	    <span class="code">ethread</span> library.</p>
          <p>
	    <strong>Note</strong>: When building for x86, the <span class="code">ethread</span>
	    library will now use instructions that first appeared on
	    the pentium 4 processor. If you want the runtime system
	    to be compatible with older processors (back to 486) you
	    need to pass the <span class="bold_code"><a href="../../installation_guide/INSTALL.html#Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP">--enable-ethread-pre-pentium4-compatibility</a></span>
	    <span class="code">configure</span> command line argument when configuring
	    the system.</p>

	    behaviour, the following will generate an error:</p>
	    <ul>
<li><p>Doing a call without explicit module name
	    to a local function having a name clashing with the name
	    of an auto-imported BIF that was present (and

	    <li><p>Using any form of the old compiler directive
	    <span class="code">nowarn_bif_clash</span></p></li> </ul> <p>If the BIF
	    was added or auto-imported in OTP R14A or later,
	    overriding it with an import or a local function will
	    only result in a warning,</p> <p>To resolve clashes, you
	    can either use the explicit module name <span class="code">erlang</span> to
	    call the BIF, or you can remove the auto-import of that
	    specific BIF by using the new compiler directive
	    <span class="code">-compile({no_auto_import,[F/A]}).</span>, which makes all
	    calls to the local or imported function without explicit
	    module name pass without warnings or errors.</p> <p>The
	    change makes it possible to add auto-imported BIFs
	    without breaking or silently changing old code in the
	    future. However some current code ingeniously utilizing
	    the old behaviour or the <span class="code">nowarn_bif_clash</span> compiler
	    directive, might need changing to be accepted by the

	    The runtime system will by default bind schedulers to

	    <strong>NOTE:</strong> If the Erlang runtime system is the only

	    The resolver routines failed to look up the own node name
	    as hostname, if the OS native resolver was erroneously
	    configured, bug reported by Yogish Baliga, now fixed.</p>
          <p>
	    The resolver routines now tries to parse the hostname as

          <p>
	    The DNS resolver inet_res and file resolver inet_hosts
	    now do not read OS configuration files until they are

	    cases they are never needed.</p>
          <p>
	    The DNS resolver's automatic updating of OS configuration
	    file data (/etc/resolv.conf) now uses the 'domain'
	    keyword as default search domain if there is no 'search'
	    keyword.</p>

        <li>
          <p>
	    Improved GC performance after BIF/NIF call when a lot of
	    heap fragments was created. This will mainly benefit NIFs

	    <p>Incompatible changes in the experimental NIF
	    feature.</p> <ul>
<li> Changed the NIF function
	    prototypes in order to allow more than 3 function
	    arguments. </li>
<li> <span class="code">enif_get_data</span> renamed as
	    <span class="code">enif_priv_data</span>. </li>
<li>
	    <span class="code">enif_make_string</span> got a third argument for
	    character encoding. </li>
<li> The return value of
	    <span class="code">erlang:load_nif/2</span> on error changed. </li>
</ul>

	    <p>Cross compilation improvements and other build system
	    improvements.</p>
	    <p>Most notable:</p> <ul>
<li> Lots of cross
	    compilation improvements. The old cross compilation
	    support was more or less non-existing as well as broken.
	    Please, note that the cross compilation support should
	    still be considered as experimental. Also note that old
	    cross compilation configurations cannot be used without
	    modifications. For more information on cross compiling
	    Erlang/OTP see the <span class="code">$ERL_TOP/INSTALL-CROSS.md</span> file.
	    </li>
<li> Support for staged install using <span class="bold_code"><a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/DESTDIR.html">DESTDIR</a></span>.
	    The old broken <span class="code">INSTALL_PREFIX</span> has also been fixed.
	    For more information see the <span class="code">$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md</span>
	    file. </li>
<li> Documentation of the <span class="code">release</span>
	    target of the top <span class="code">Makefile</span>. For more information
	    see the <span class="code">$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md</span> file. </li>
<li>
	    <span class="code">make install</span> now by default creates relative
	    symbolic links instead of absolute ones. For more
	    information see the <span class="code">$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md</span> file.
	    </li>
<li> <span class="code">$ERL_TOP/configure --help=recursive</span>
	    now works and prints help for all applications with
	    <span class="code">configure</span> scripts. </li>
<li> Doing <span class="code">make
	    install</span>, or <span class="code">make release</span> directly after
	    <span class="code">make all</span> no longer triggers miscellaneous
	    rebuilds. </li>
<li> Existing bootstrap system is now
	    used when doing <span class="code">make install</span>, or <span class="code">make
	    release</span> without a preceding <span class="code">make all</span>.
	    </li>
<li> The <span class="code">crypto</span> and <span class="code">ssl</span>
	    applications use the same runtime library path when
	    dynamically linking against <span class="code">libssl.so</span> and
	    <span class="code">libcrypto.so</span>. The runtime library search path has
	    also been extended. </li>
<li> The <span class="code">configure</span>
	    scripts of Erl_interface and ODBC now
	    search for thread libraries and thread library quirks the
	    same way as ERTS do. </li>
<li> The
	    <span class="code">configure</span> script of the <span class="code">odbc</span> application
	    now also looks for odbc libraries in <span class="code">lib64</span> and
	    <span class="code">lib/64</span> directories when building on a 64-bit
	    system. </li>
<li> The <span class="code">config.h.in</span> file in the
	    <span class="code">erl_interface</span> application is now automatically
	    generated in instead of statically updated which reduces
	    the risk of <span class="code">configure</span> tests without any effect.
	    </li>
</ul>

	    <p>The documentation is now possible to build in an open

	    some features are added in the documentation build
	    process. </p>
	    <p>- The arity calculation is updated.</p>
	    <p>- The module prefix used in the function names for
	    bif's are removed in the generated links so the links
	    will look like
	    "http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#append_element-2"
	    instead of
	    "http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#erlang:append_element-2".</p>
	    <p>- Enhanced the menu positioning in the html
	    documentation when a new page is loaded.</p>
	    <p>- A number of corrections in the generation of man
	    pages (thanks to Sergei Golovan)</p>
	    <p>- The legal notice is taken from the xml book file so
	    OTP's build process can be used for non OTP

          <p>
	    - Add erts_debug:lock_counters({copy_save, bool()}). This

	    A new garbage collecting strategy for binaries which is
	    more aggressive than the previous implementation.
	    Binaries now has a virtual binary heap tied to each
	    process. When binaries are created or received to a
	    process it will check if the heap limit has been reached
	    and if a reclaim should be done. This imitates the
	    behavior of ordinary Erlang terms. The virtual heaps are
	    grown and shrunk like ordinary heaps. This will lessen
	    the memory footprint of binaries in a system.</p>

    <h4>Improvements and New Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Major improvements of the Erlang distribution for Erlang
	    runtime systems with SMP support. Previously distribution
	    port locks were heavily contended, and all encoding and
	    decoding for a specific distribution channel had to be
	    done in sequence. Lock contention due to the distribution
	    is now negligible and both encoding and decoding of
	    Erlang messages can be done in parallel.</p>
          <p>
	    The old atom cache protocol used by the Erlang
	    distribution has been dropped since it effectively
	    prevented all parallel encoding and decoding of messages
	    passed over the same distribution channel.</p>
          <p>
	    A new atom cache protocol has been introduced which
	    isolates atom cache accesses and makes parallel encoding
	    and decoding of messages passed over the same
	    distribution channel possible. The new atom cache
	    protocol also use an atom cache size 8 times larger than
	    before. The new atom cache protocol is documented in the
	    ERTS users guide.</p>
          <p>
	    Erlang messages received via the distribution are now
	    decoded by the receiving Erlang processes without holding
	    any distribution channel specific locks. Erlang messages
	    and signals sent over the distribution are as before
	    encoded by the sending Erlang process, but now without
	    holding any distribution channel specific locks during
	    the encoding. That is, both encoding and decoding can be
	    and are done in parallel regardless of distribution
	    channel used.</p>
          <p>
	    The part that cannot be parallelized is the atom cache
	    updates. Atom cache updates are therefore now scheduled
	    on the distribution port. Since it is only one entity per
	    distribution channel doing this work there is no lock
	    contention due to the atom cache updates.</p>
          <p>
	    The new runtime system does not understand the old atom
	    cache protocol. New and old runtime systems can however
	    still communicate, but no atom cache will be used.</p>

	    Improved SMP concurrency for ETS tables. Several mutating
	    operations can now be performed truly concurrent on
	    different records of the same table. To support this, the
	    table has to be created with option
	    <span class="code">write_concurrency</span>, as it is achieved at the
	    expense of some execution and memory overhead.
	    <span class="code">ets:select</span> and <span class="code">select_count</span> has also been
	    improved for all tables to not acquire exclusive table
	    lock during the iteration.</p>

	    Added functionality to get higher resolution timestamp
	    from system. The erlang:now function returns a timestamp
	    that's not always consistent with the actual operating
	    system time (due to resilience against large time changes
	    in the operating system). The function os:timestamp/0 is
	    added to get a similar timestamp as the one being
	    returned by erlang:now, but untouched by Erlangs time
	    correcting and smoothing algorithms. The timestamp
	    returned by os:timestamp is always consistent with the
	    operating systems view of time, like the calendar
	    functions for getting wall clock time, but with higher
	    resolution. Example of usage can be found in the os
	    manual page.</p>

	    The runtime system with SMP support now uses multiple,

          <p>

	    needed to balance the load between the schedulers. The
	    reduced amount of migration also reduce lock contention
	    on locks protecting the scheduler specific instances of
	    the erts internal memory allocators.</p>

	    <p>Support for Unicode is implemented as described in

	    modules. Files can be opened in modes with automatic
	    translation to and from different unicode formats. The
	    module 'unicode' contains functions for conversion
	    between external and internal unicode formats and the re
	    module has support for unicode data. There is also
	    language syntax for specifying string and character data
	    beyond the ISO-latin-1 range.</p>
	    <p>The interactive shell will support input and output of

	    <p>The io_protocol between io_Server and client is

	    new part of the manual.</p>
	    <p><strong>io module incompatibilities:</strong></p>
	    <p>The io:put_chars, io:get_chars and io:get_line all
	    handle and return unicode data. In the case where
	    binaries can be provided (as to io:put_chars), they shall
	    be encoded in UTF-8. When binaries are returned (as by
	    io:get_line/get_chars when the io_server is set in
	    <strong>binary mode</strong>) the returned data is also
	    <strong>always</strong> encoded as UTF-8. The file module however
	    still returns byte-oriented data, why file:read can be
	    used instead of io:get_chars to read binary data in
	    ISO-latin-1.</p>
	    <p><strong>io_lib module incompatibilities:</strong></p>

	    Scheduler threads can now be bound to logical processors
	    on newer Linux and Solaris systems. More systems will be
	    supported in the future.</p>
          <p>
	    In some cases performance has increased drastically when
	    binding schedulers. Schedulers are not bound by default,
	    though. This since it might cause a performance
	    degradation if multiple programs have bound to
	    processors, e.g. multiple Erlang runtime systems. For
	    more information see the documentation of
	    <span class="code">erlang:system_flag/2</span>.</p>
          <p>
	    In order to bind scheduler threads the CPU topology need
	    to be known. On some newer Linux and Solaris systems the
	    runtime system automatically detects the CPU topology. If
	    the emulator isn't able to automatically detect the CPU
	    topology, the CPU topology can be defined. For more
	    information see the documentation of

	    <p>Memory management improvements especially for the

	    runtime system with SMP support can now use multiple,
	    thread specific instances of most memory allocators. This
	    improves performance since it reduces lock contention in
	    the memory allocators. It may however increase memory
	    usage for some applications. The runtime system with SMP
	    support will by default enable this feature on most
	    allocators. The amount of instances used can be
	    configured. </li> <li> <span class="code">driver_alloc()</span>,
	    <span class="code">driver_realloc()</span>, and <span class="code">driver_free()</span> now use
	    their own erts specific memory allocator instead of the
	    default <span class="code">malloc()</span> implementation on the system.
	    </li> <li> The default configuration of some
	    allocators have been changed to fit applications that use
	    much memory better. </li> <li> Some new
	    <span class="code">erts_alloc</span> configuration parameters have been
	    added. </li> <li> <span class="code">erts_alloc_config</span> has been
	    modified to be able to create configurations suitable for
	    multiple instances of allocators. </li> <li> The
	    returned value from <span class="code">erlang:system_info({allocator,
	    Alloc})</span> has been changed. This since an allocator may
	    now run in multiple instances. </li> </ul> <p>If you
	    for some reason want the memory allocators to be
	    configured as before, you can pass the <span class="code">+Mea r11b</span>
	    command-line argument to <span class="code">erl</span>.</p> <p>For more

	    <p>Literal lists, tuples, and binaries are no longer
	    constructed at run-time as they used to be, but are
	    stored in a per-module constant pool. Literals that are
	    used more than once are stored only once.</p>
	    <p>This is not a change to the language, only in the
	    details of its implementation. Therefore, the
	    implications of this change is described in the
	    Efficiency Guide.</p>
	    <p>Example 1: In the expression <span class="code">element(BitNum-1,
	    {1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128})</span>, the tuple used to be
	    constructed every time the expression was executed, which
	    could be detrimental to performance in two ways if the
	    expression was executed in a loop: the time to build the
	    tuple itself and the time spent in garbage collections
	    because the heap filled up with garbage faster.</p>
	    <p>Example 2: Literal strings, such as <span class="code">"abc"</span>, used
	    to be stored in the compiled code compactly as a byte
	    string and expanded to a list at run-time. Now all
	    strings will be stored expanded to lists (such as
	    <span class="code">[$a,$b,$c]</span>) in the constant pool. That means that
	    the string will be faster to use at run-time, but that it
	    will require more space even when not used. If space is
	    an issue, you might want to use binary literals (that is,
	    <span class="code">&lt;&lt;"abc"&gt;&gt;</span>) instead of string literals for
	    infrequently used long strings (such as error
	    messages).</p>

          <p>An interface towards the SCTP Socket API Extensions
            has been implemented.It is an Open Source patch courtesy
            of Serge Aleynikov and Leonid Timochouk. The Erlang code
            parts has been adapted by the OTP team, changing the
            Erlang API somewhat.</p>
          <p>The Erlang interface consists of the module
            <span class="code">gen_sctp</span> and an include file
            <span class="code">-include_lib("kernel/include/inet_sctp.hrl").</span> for
            option record definitions. The <span class="code">gen_sctp</span> module is
            documented.</p>
          <p>The delivered Open Source patch, before the OTP team
            rewrites, was written according to
            http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctpsocket-13
            and was claimed to work fine, tested on Linux Fedora Core
            5.0 (kernel 2.6.15-2054 or later) and on Solaris 10 and
            11. The OTP team rewrites used the same standard document
            but might have accidentally broken some functionality. If
            so it will soon be patched to working state. The tricky
            parts in C and the general design has essentially not
            changed. During the rewrites the code was hand tested on
            SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 10, and briefly on Solaris
            10. Feedbach on code and docs is very much
            appreciated.</p>
          <p>The SCTP interface is in beta state. It has only been
            hand tested and has no automatic test suites in OPT
            meaning everything is most certainly not tested. Socket
            active mode is broken. IPv6 is not tested. The
            documentation has been reworked due to the API changes,
            but has not been proofread after this.</p>
          <p>Thank you from the OTP team to Serge Aleynikov and
            Leonid Timochouk for a valuable contribution. We hope we

          <p>The fallback implementation of spin locks and atomic

          <p>The Erlang runtime system with SMP support can now run on
            Linux systems that has Linuxthreads instead of NPTL
            (Native POSIX Thread Library). Note that the SMP support
            hasn't been as thoroughly tested with Linuxthreads as
            with NPTL. A runtime system with SMP support will
            therefore not be built by default on Linux when NPTL
            isn't found. In order to force a build of the runtime
            system with SMP support, pass <span class="code">--enable-smp-support</span>

          <p>The runtime check for detection of old incompatible

            doesn't use the extended driver interface, there is a
            risk that it will be loaded also when the driver is
            incompatible. When the driver use the extended driver

        <li>
          <p>In the runtime system with SMP support, the global
            I/O lock has been replaced with a more fine grained port
            locking scheme. Port locking is either done on driver
            level, i.e., all ports executing the same driver share a
            lock, or on port level, i.e., each port has its own lock.
            Currently the inet driver, the efile driver, and the
            spawn driver use port level locking and all other
            statically linked in drivers use driver level locking. By
            default dynamically linked in drivers will use locking on
            driver level. For more information on how to enable port
            level locking see the <span class="code">erl_driver(3)</span> and the
            <span class="code">driver_entry(3)</span> man pages. </p>
          <p>As of erts
            version 5.5.3 the driver interface has been extended. The
            extended interface introduce version management, the
            possibility to pass capability flags to the runtime
            system at driver initialization, and some new driver API
            functions. For example, the <span class="code">driver_system_info()</span>
            function which can be used to determine if the driver is
            run in a runtime system with SMP support or not. The
            extended interface doesn't have to be used, <strong>but</strong>
            dynamically linked in driver <strong>have</strong> to be
            recompiled. For information see the <span class="code">erl_driver(3)</span>
            and the <span class="code">driver_entry(3)</span> man pages. </p>

          <p>A port program that had been started with the
            <span class="code">exit_status</span> option and closed one of the pipes
            used for communication with the emulator caused the
            emulator to continuously poll for termination of the port
            program. This only became a problem when the emulator
            didn't have other things to do and the port program
            closed a pipe much earlier than it terminated. When the
            emulator had other things to do, such as running Erlang
            processes, the emulator polled for termination in between
            scheduling of processes.</p>
          <p>Now the emulator doesn't poll for termination of the port
            program at all; instead, it waits for the child signal
            from the terminated port program to arrive and then
            schedules the Erlang port for termination.</p>
          <p>The termination of any port programs have also been
            optimized. Previously the termination of any port program
            did always cause a scan of a table of the size equal to
            maximum number of file descriptors. If the maximum number
            of file descriptors was large, this scan could be quite
            expensive. Now the search have been reduced to the set of
            ports started with the <span class="code">exit_status</span> option.</p>
          <p>Note, all of the above only applies to Erlang emulators
            on Unix platforms.</p>

            distributions that don't have the traditional pseudo-tty
            devices in the file system. On platforms that don't have
            openpty(3), run_erl will still search for pseudo-tty

          <p>The run_erl program will now wait using waitpid(3) to

            will also terminate after a delay of 5 seconds (to allow
            any pending output to be written to the log file) if the
            spawned program terminates even if some child of it still
            holds stdin and/or stdout open.</p>

          <p>Kernel poll support can now be combined with SMP support.
            Currently the following kernel poll versions exist:
            <span class="code">/dev/poll</span>, <span class="code">epoll</span>, and <span class="code">kqueue</span>. Linux
            <span class="code">kpoll</span> has been replaced with <span class="code">epoll</span>. Some
            time in the future there will also be a kernel poll
            version using Solaris event ports.</p>
          <p>The "check io" implementation for unix has been
            completely rewritten. The current kernel poll
            implementation reduce the amount of system calls needed
            compared to the old kernel poll implementation.</p>
          <p>When <span class="code">epoll</span> or <span class="code">kqueue</span> is used either
            <span class="code">poll</span> or <span class="code">select</span> is used as fallback.
            Previously only <span class="code">poll</span> could be used as fallback.
            Since <span class="code">select</span> now can be used as fallback, kernel
            poll support is now also available on newer MacOSX. Note
            however, when <span class="code">select</span> is used as fallback, the
            maximum number of file descriptors is limited to
            <span class="code">FD_SETSIZE</span>. </p>
          <p>Kernel poll support is now enabled by default if
            <span class="code">/dev/poll</span>, <span class="code">epoll</span>, or <span class="code">kqueue</span> is found
            when building OTP, i.e. you do not have to pass the
            <span class="code">--enable-kernel-poll</span> argument to <span class="code">configure</span>.
            As before, kernel poll is disabled by default in the
            runtime system. In order to enable it, pass the
            <span class="code">+Ktrue</span> command line argument to <span class="code">erl</span>.</p>
          <p>Note: <span class="code">configure</span> will refuse to enable kernel poll
            support on FreeBSD since <span class="code">kqueue</span> have problems with
            (at least) pipes on all version of FreeBSD that we have
            tested.</p>

          <p>Previously <span class="code">unlink/1</span> and <span class="code">erlang:demonitor/2</span>
            behaved completely asynchronous. This had one undesirable
            effect, though. You could never know when you were
            guaranteed <strong>not</strong> to be affected by a link that you
            had unlinked or a monitor that you had demonitored.</p>
          <p>The new behavior of <span class="code">unlink/1</span> and
            <span class="code">erlang:demonitor/2</span> can be viewed as two operations

            results of the link or monitor.</p>
          <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This change can cause some obscure code
            to fail which previously did not. For example, the

          <p>Erlang runtime system with SMP (symmetric multi processing)
            support.</p>
          <p>The runtime system with SMP support is in this release
            focused on stability and there are a number of steps
            with optimizations to follow before it will take 
            full advantage of multi processor systems.
            The released system is however truly multi threaded
            and you will notice increased performance
            for many applications already.
            We recommend that you evaluate your application on  
            the SMP version of the runtime system and wait for some
            more optimizations before you use it in a real product. 
            You will then discover if there are any problems in 
            your application that needs to be fixed in order for 
            it to work properly in a multi threaded environment. 
            More optimized versions of the runtime system
            with SMP support will be included in the R11B
            maintenance releases.</p>
          <p>The SMP enabled runtime system will be started if
            the <span class="code">-smp</span> command line argument is passed to
            the <span class="code">erl</span> command. In order to make use of more than
            one processor core, multiple scheduler threads are used. By
            default, the number of scheduler threads will equal
            the number of processor cores. The number of scheduler
            threads can be set with the <span class="code">+S</span> command line argument.
            For more information see the <span class="code">erl(1)</span> man page.</p>
          <p>A runtime system with SMP support is by default built on
            the following platforms if posix threads, and a gcc
            compiler of at least version 2.95 is found:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Linux with at least kernel version 2.6 and the Native
                POSIX Thread Library on x86, x86_64, and 32-bits
                PowerPC.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Solaris of at least version 8 on 32-bits SPARC-V9.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>MacOSX of at least version 10.4 (Darwin 8.0) on
                32-bits PowerPC.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The runtime system with SMP support is known <strong>not</strong>
            to build on:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Windows.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Linux with kernel versions less than 2.4, or without
                the Native POSIX Thread Library.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Other hardware platforms than x86, x86_64, 32-bits
                SPARC-V9 and 32-bits PowerPC.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Windows will be supported in a future release.</p>
          <p>The runtime system with SMP support might build on other
            operating systems in combination with supported hardware.
            In order to force a build of a runtime system with SMP
            support, pass the <span class="code">--enable-smp-support</span> command line
            argument to configure. Note, however, that it is not enough
            that it builds. The underlying thread library and operating
            system has to provide SMP support as well. If the thread
            library does not distribute scheduler threads over multiple
            processor cores then the runtime system will only seemingly
            provide SMP support. If the runtime system is not built by
            default on a specific platform, we have <strong>not</strong> tested
            it on that platform.</p>
          <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The design of SMP support for drivers is
            ongoing. There will probably be incompatible driver
            changes (only affecting drivers run on the runtime system
            with SMP support) released as patches for R11B.</p>
          <p><strong>Potential incompatibility</strong>: Previously, specific
            driver call-backs were always called from the same thread.
            This is <strong>not</strong> true in the runtime system with SMP
            support. Calls to call-backs will be made from different
            threads, e.g., two consecutive calls to exactly the same
            call-back can be made from two different threads. This
            will in <strong>most</strong> cases not be a problem. All calls
            to call-backs are synchronized, i.e., only one call-back
            will be called at a time.</p>
          <p>In the future the default behavior will <strong>probably</strong>
            be the following: Calls to call-backs will, as now, be
            made from different threads. Calls to call-backs in the
            same driver <strong>instance</strong> will be synchronized. It
            will probably be possible to configure so that all calls
            to call-backs in all driver instances of a specific
            driver type will be synchronized. It may be possible to
            configure so that all calls to call-backs of a driver
            instance or a of a specific driver type will be made from
            the same thread.</p>
          <p>Parallelism in the Erlang code executed is a necessity
            for the Erlang runtime system to be able to take
            advantage of multi-core or multi-processor hardware.
            There need to be at least as many Erlang processes
            runnable as processor cores for the Erlang runtime system
            to be able to take advantage of all processor cores.</p>
          <p>An Erlang runtime system with SMP support with only one
            Erlang process runnable all the time will almost always be
            slower than the same Erlang runtime system without SMP
            support. This is due to thread synchronization overhead.</p>
          <p>Known major bottleneck in the Erlang runtime system:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Currently the I/O system uses one "big lock", i.e. only
                one thread can do I/O at a time (with the exception of
                async threads and threads created by users own linked-in
                drivers). This is high on the list of things to
                optimize. Note, code that does not do I/O can be executed
                at the same time as one thread does I/O.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Some pitfalls which might cause Erlang programs that work on
            the non-SMP runtime system to fail on the SMP runtime
            system:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>A newly spawned process will often begin executing
                immediately. Code that expects that the parent process
                will be able to execute for a while before the child
                process begins executing is likely to fail.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>High priority processes could previously provide
                mutual exclusion (bad programming style) by preventing
                normal and low priority processes from being run. High
                priority processes cannot be used this way to provide
                mutual exclusion.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><span class="code">erlang:yield()</span> could be used to provide some
                kind of temporary mutual exclusion (also bad programming
                style). <span class="code">erlang:yield()</span> cannot be used to provide
                any kind of mutual exclusion.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Obscure pitfall, only if a process being traced also
                sends normal messages to the tracer:<br>
                  The order between trace messages and normal
                messages is undefined. I.e. the order between normal
                messages sent from a tracee to a tracer and the trace
                messages generated from the same tracee to the same
                tracer is undefined. The internal order of normal
                messages and the internal order of trace messages will,
                of course, be preserved as before.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The kernel poll feature is currently not supported by
            the runtime system with SMP support. It will probably be
            supported in a future release.</p>

          <p>The <span class="code">c</span> option for the <span class="code">+B</span> flag has been
            introduced which makes it possible to use Ctrl-C
            (Ctrl-Break on Windows) to interrupt the shell process
            rather than to invoke the emulator break handler. All new
            <span class="code">+B</span> options are also supported on Windows
            (<span class="code">werl</span>) as of now. Furthermore, Ctrl-C on Windows has
            now been reserved for copying text (what Ctrl-Ins was used
            for previously). Ctrl-Break should be used for break
            handling. Lastly, the documentation of the system flags has
            been updated.</p>
