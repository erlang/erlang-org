<h1>1 Compiler Release Notes</h1>
  
  <p>This document describes the changes made to the Compiler
    application.</p>

<h3><a name="id60784">1.1 
        Compiler 6.0.3</a></h3>

    <h4>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    An complicated guard expression in a function call could
	    crash the compiler. (Thanks to Thomas Arts for reporting
	    this bug.)</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-13208</p>
        </li>
        <li>
	    <p>Constructing a map in a guard in a catch could crash
	    the compiler. (Thanks to Thomas Arts for reporting this
	    bug.)</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-13223</p>
        </li>
        <li>
	    <p>Updating a fun as if it were a map would cause the
	    compiler to crash. (Thanks to Thomas Arts for reporting
	    this bug.)</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-13231</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Fix pretty printing of Core Maps</p>
          <p>
	    Literal maps could cause Dialyzer to crash when pretty
	    printing the results.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-13238</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    A complex combination of bit syntax matching operations
	    would cause an internal consistency check failure during
	    compilation. (Thanks to Jose Valim for reporting this
	    bug.)</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-13309</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    



<h3><a name="id64889">1.2 
        Compiler 6.0.2</a></h3>

    <h4>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Fix cerl_trees:label/2 bug with map K/V swap</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-13091</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Warnings produced when the '<span class="code">bin_opt_info</span>' option
	    was given could sometimes lack filenames and line
	    numbers. (Thanks to José Valim for reporting this bug.)</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-13113</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    



<h3><a name="id64932">1.3 
        Compiler 6.0.1</a></h3>

    <h4>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Fix <span class="code">get_map_elements</span> register corruption</p>
          <p>
	    Instruction <span class="code">get_map_elements</span> might destroy target
	    registers when the fail-label is taken. Only seen for
	    patterns with two, and only two, target registers.
	    Specifically if we copy one register and then jump.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-12967</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    



<h3><a name="id64973">1.4 
        Compiler 6.0</a></h3>

    <h4>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    The compiler optimizes away building of terms that are
	    never actually used. As a result, the compiler in OTP 18
	    may produce more warnings for terms that are built but
	    not used than the compiler in OTP 17.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-12453</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Using a map could incorrectly suppress warnings for
	    unused variables.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-12515</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    The compiler now properly reports unknown parse
	    transforms. That is, <span class="code">undef</span> exceptions coming from
	    the parse transform itself is reported differently from
	    the absence of the parse transform.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-12723</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Allow for 'creation of sub binary delayed' optimization
	    if maps instructions are in a clause.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-12758</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    


    <h4>Improvements and New Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    The <span class="code">cerl</span> and <span class="code">cerl_trees</span> modules in the
	    <span class="code">compiler</span> application are now documented.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-11978</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    The deprecated '<span class="code">asm</span>' option has been removed.</p>
          <p>
	    *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-12100</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Support variables as Map keys in expressions and patterns</p>
	    <p>Erlang will accept any expression as keys in Map
	    expressions and it will accept literals or bound
	    variables as keys in Map patterns.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-12218</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Infer Map type information in beam_type compiler
	    optimization pass.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-12253</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Compiler optimizations have been improved.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-12393</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Five undocumented functions in the module <span class="code">core_lib</span>
	    have been deprecated and will be removed in the next
	    major release. The functions are: <span class="code">get_anno/{1,2}</span>,
	    <span class="code">is_literal/1</span>, <span class="code">is_literal_list/1</span>, and
	    <span class="code">literal_value</span>. Use the appropriate functions in
	    the <span class="code">cerl</span> module instead.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-12497</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Change some internal data structures to Maps in order to
	    speed up compilation time. Measured speed up is around
	    10%-15%.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-12774</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Fix beam_bool pass for Maps instruction get_map_elements</p>
          <p>
	    Before beam_split the get_map_elements instruction is
	    still in blocks and the helper function in beam_jump did
	    not reflect this.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-12844 Aux Id: 17 </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    



<h3><a name="id67208">1.5 
        Compiler 5.0.4</a></h3>

    <h4>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Matching out a map from a record and then updating the
	    record could cause a 'badarg' exception at run-time.
	    (Thanks to Dmitry Aleksandrov for reporting this bug.)</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-12402</p>
        </li>
        <li>
	    <p>The compiler would crash when compiling some complex,
	    nonsensical guards such as:</p>
	    <p> ... <span class="code">when {{X}}, -X</span>...</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-12410</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    In rare circumstances, using binary pattern in the value
	    part of a map pattern would cause the compiler to crash.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-12414</p>
        </li>
        <li>
	    <p>Case expressions where a map was wrapped in a tuple or
	    list such as:</p>
	    <p><span class="code">case {a,Map} of</span><br> <span class="code">{a,#{k:=_}}=Tuple -&gt;
	    Tuple</span><br> <span class="code">end.</span></p>
	    <p>would be unsafely "optimized" to either cause an
	    exception at run-time or would return an empty map.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-12451</p>
        </li>
        <li>
	    <p>When a variable was compared to a literal map using
	    the '<span class="code">==</span>' operator, the compiler would change the
	    operator to '<span class="code">=:=</span>' since it is more efficient.
	    However, this optimization is not safe if the map literal
	    has numeric keys or values. The compiler will now only do
	    the optimization if all keys and values are
	    non-numeric.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-12456</p>

	    The compiler now properly annotates the code in value in
	    the '<span class="code">after</span>' clause for a '<span class="code">try</span>' so that

	    With <span class="code">--Wunmatched_returns</span>, dialyzer will no longer

	    tuples and lists). Example: ignoring '<span class="code">[io:format(...)

	    The default encoding for Erlang source files is now
	    UTF-8. As a temporary measure to ease the transition from
	    the old default of latin-1, if the compiler encounters
	    byte sequences that are not valid UTF-8 sequences, the
	    compiler will re-try the compilation in latin-1 mode.
	    This workaround will be removed in a future release.</p>

          <p>
	    Because of a copy-and-paste error in erlc.c, the -MP flag
	    had the same effect as -MG. As a workaround, you had to
	    pass +makedep_phony to enable the MP option. This patch
	    makes -MP work as intended.</p>

	    <p>The compiler used to allow that a binary field without
	    size could be used in other positions than at the end in
	    bit syntax pattern. For instance,
	    <span class="code">&lt;&lt;B/binary,EmptyBinary/binary&gt;&gt; = Bin</span>
	    used to compile, but now the compilation will fail with
	    an an error message.</p>
	    <p>Also, it is now longer permitted to give a literal
	    string in a binary pattern a type or a size; for
	    instance, <span class="code">&lt;&lt;"abc"/binary&gt;&gt; = Bin</span> will
	    no longer compile. (In previous releases, there would
	    always be a <span class="code">badmatch</span> exception at run-time.)</p>

	    <p>Literal lists, tuples, and binaries are no longer
	    constructed at run-time as they used to be, but are
	    stored in a per-module constant pool. Literals that are
	    used more than once are stored only once.</p>
	    <p>This is not a change to the language, only in the
	    details of its implementation. Therefore, the
	    implications of this change is described in the
	    Efficiency Guide.</p>
	    <p>Example 1: In the expression <span class="code">element(BitNum-1,
	    {1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128})</span>, the tuple used to be
	    constructed every time the expression was executed, which
	    could be detrimental to performance in two ways if the
	    expression was executed in a loop: the time to build the
	    tuple itself and the time spent in garbage collections
	    because the heap filled up with garbage faster.</p>
	    <p>Example 2: Literal strings, such as <span class="code">"abc"</span>, used
	    to be stored in the compiled code compactly as a byte
	    string and expanded to a list at run-time. Now all
	    strings will be stored expanded to lists (such as
	    <span class="code">[$a,$b,$c]</span>) in the constant pool. That means that
	    the string will be faster to use at run-time, but that it
	    will require more space even when not used. If space is
	    an issue, you might want to use binary literals (that is,
	    <span class="code">&lt;&lt;"abc"&lt;&lt;</span>) instead of string literals for
	    infrequently used long strings (such as error
	    messages).</p>

	    <p>Two new guard BIFs have been introduced as a

	    <span class="code">size/1</span> BIF will be removed no earlier than in
	    R14B.) The BIFs are <span class="code">tuple_size/1</span> to calculate the
	    size of a tuple and <span class="code">byte_size/1</span> to calculate the
	    number of bytes needed for the contents of the binary or
	    bitstring (rounded up to the nearest number of bytes if
	    necessary).</p>
	    <p>There is also a new <span class="code">bit_size/1</span> BIF that returns

	    contains.</p>

            code that could cause a crash at run-time (e.g.
            <span class="code">R#r{a="abc",b=1}</span>). (Thanks to Mikael Karlsson.)</p>
          <p>Unecessary tests (such as a 'case' with two case
            branches that were identical) could cause the compiler to
            crash. (Thanks to Fredrik Thulin.)</p>
          <p>The validation pass of the compiler could generate an
            error for correct code when floating point operations
            were used in try/catch statements.</p>
          <p>In bit syntax construction, any field following a
            binary field would always be marked as "aligned" (which
            may or may not be correct). That would cause the hipe
            native compiler to generate incorrect code if the field
            was in fact unaligned. (Thanks to Per Gustafsson.)</p>
          <p>Some complex guard expressions (such as <span class="code">A#a.b==""; A#a.b==undefined</span>) would crash the compiler. (Thanks
            to Sean Hinde.)</p>
          <p>Compilation speed has been increased for modules with
            many functions and/or atoms (such as modules generated by
            the Asn1 application or other code generators).</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Given bit syntax construction in certain complex
            contexts involving a catch, the compiler would either
            crash or terminate due to failure in an internal
            consistency check. (Thanks to Fredrik Thulin.)</p>

            <span class="code">&lt;&lt;103133:64/float&gt;&gt; = &lt;&lt;103133:64/float&gt;&gt;</span>
            used to fail. Now they succeed.</p>
          <p>Shadowing of variables in bit syntax matches in fun heads

            <span class="code">L = 8, F = fun(&lt;&lt;L:L,B:L&gt;&gt;) -&gt; B end</span> was
            handled incorrectly by the compiler. The fun used to be
            compiled as if it was written
            '<span class="code">&gt;fun(&lt;&lt;8:8,B:8&gt;&gt;)</span>, while it should be
            compiled in the same way as <span class="code">fun(&lt;&lt;L:8,B:L&gt;&gt;)</span>.</p>
          <p>A bug in the validation pass has been corrected. It
            sometimes occurred when the compiler optimized by reusing
            code for causing an exception when the reused code was
            called from within catch or try-catch statements. Then the
            validator refused to approve the code and complained about
            <span class="code">fun(&lt;&lt;L:L,B:L&gt;&gt;) -&gt; B end</span> was handled
            incorrectly by the in the same way as
            <span class="code">fun(&lt;&lt;L:8,B:L&gt;&gt;)</span>.</p>
          <p>A bug in the unknown_catch_try_state.</p>
          <p>Corrected a bug in the optimizer that would cause
            the compiler to crash. (Thanks to Peter-Henry Mander.)</p>
          <p>There are now warnings generated if a bit syntax
            construction will fail at run-time because of a type
