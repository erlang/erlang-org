        release_note: "*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***\n\nImproved unicode support for strings. Added normalization functions in the unicode module. Extended the string module API with new functions with improved unicode handling and that works on grapheme clusters. The new functions operates on the unicode:chardata() type, thus they also accept UTF-8 binaries as input.\n\nThe old string API have been marked as obsolete. The return values have been changed for some error cases.\n\n"

        release_note: "*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***\n\nOptimized ETS operations by changing table identifier type from integer to reference. The reference enables a more direct mapping to the table with less potential lock contention and makes especially creation and deletion of tables scale much better.\n\nThe change of the opaque type for the ETS table identifiers may cause failure in code that make faulty assumptions about this opaque type.\n\nThe number of tables stored at one Erlang node *used* to be limited. This is no longer the case (except by memory usage). The previous default limit was about 1400 tables and could be increased by setting the environment variable ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES before starting the Erlang runtime system. This hard limit has been removed, but it is currently useful to set the ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES anyway. It should be set to an approximate of the maximum amount of tables used. This since an internal table for named tables is sized using this value. If large amounts of named tables are used and ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES hasn't been increased, the performance of named table lookup will degrade.\n\n"

This is no longer the case (except by memory usage). The previous default limit was about 1400 tables and could be increased by setting the environment variable ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES before starting the Erlang runtime system. This hard limit has been removed, but it is currently useful to set the ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES anyway. It should be set to an approximate of the maximum amount of tables used. This since an internal table for named tables is sized using this value.
