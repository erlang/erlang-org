<p>Regular expressions are widely used. Regardless of how other features
of a language can be used to match or pick out parts of a string, many
programmers prefer the regular expression syntax and expect
regular expressions to be available in a modern language.</p>

<p>The Perl programming language has integrated regular expressions
directly into the syntax and Perl programmers are often highly skilled
at writing complicated regular expressions that parse e.g. text files,
HTTP requests or simple user input. The Perl extensions to the common
regular expressions are widely known and many modern programming
languages support something similar.</p>

<p>Erlang currently has a minimalistic regular expression module (regexp
module in STDLIB), which lacks features commonly available in other
implementations. The current library is also painfully slow compared
to the native C libraries utilized in other languages.</p>

<p>Erlang needs to interface with a modern regular expression library in
a way that does not break the properties of the virtual machine.</p>

<p>Writing a more efficient regular expression library purely in Erlang
has been attempted, but so far no really efficient implementation has
been proposed, and the work involved in creating one is deemed
extensive.</p>

<p>On the other hand, several more or less successful attempts to
integrate an external regular expressions library into the virtual
machine have been presented. None of them, however, have addressed the
issue of long running regular expressions stalling the schedulers.</p>

<p>A built in function in the Erlang VM needs to stop execution when it
has run a certain amount of iterations, to avoid stalling a scheduler
and thereby starving other processes in the system. When the Erlang
process gets scheduled again, the built in function restarts and has
provided some way of storing it’s current state so that execution of
the function can continue where it was once left.</p>

<p>The execution of a regular expression match is in many ways similar to the
virtual machine’s execution of ordinary beam code, but the available
libraries are (for obvious reasons) not prepared to give up the
execution temporarily to allow other processes to execute. A
complicated regular expression on large amounts of subject data can
take seconds or even minutes to execute. Stalling one of the
schedulers in the VM for that amount of time is not an option in a
real parallel system. As suggested interfaces to external libraries
have never addressed this problem, none have been accepted and/or
integrated in the main Erlang distribution.</p>

<p>Stack usage is another issue seldom addressed. The Erlang virtual
machine may run a lot of scheduler threads, especially on processors
with large amounts of cores. Multithreading applications need to be
careful about stack usage, why recursive C routines are best
avoided. The Erlang virtual machine avoids recursion in C code, why a
linked in library should do the same. When it comes to realtime
operating systems, the need to avoid recursion in the C code is even
more obvious. The library used for Erlang regular expressions simply
cannot be recursive on the C stack, at least not in a way where stack
usage cannot be determined at compile time.</p>
      <h3 id="multithreading-versus-interruptible-execution">
        
        
          Multithreading versus interruptible execution <a href="#multithreading-versus-interruptible-execution">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>The problem of interrupting the execution of a regular expression (or
other lengthy operations) when another Erlang process should be
scheduled, has two obvious solutions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Count the number of iterations in a regular expression match, store
the state after a certain amount of iterations (or a certain amount
of time) and return control to the scheduler when execution time
slot is exceeded.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let the operating system take care of the problem by executing the
regular expression matches in separate kernel threads.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In the virtual machine’s file driver, the second approach is used,
introducing the concept of the asynchronous thread pool. The file I/O
case is however special as the I/O operation in itself usually
consumes far more time than the running time for the inter-thread
communication and task switching involved when using asynchronous
threads. Besides, there simply is no other solution at hand for I/O,
so OS threads is the <em>only</em> solution at hand in that case.</p>

<p>If regular expressions were to be executed in separate threads, even
very small and simple expressions would have to carry the extra burden
of OS level task switching and communication.</p>

<p>Other lengthy operations in the virtual machine use the first
approach of voluntary interruption and rescheduling. In the cases
where external libraries are involved, like IP communication, the
emulator provides ways to passively wait for events by supplying
interfaces to I/O multiplexing (select/poll). This is the way to avoid
blocking the schedulers in most drivers. Asynchronous threads are only
utilized where there simply are no other options, like in file I/O
(which cannot utilize I/O multiplexing).</p>

<p>Using the first solution when interfacing an external library in a
driver or BIF, involves either finding a library where interruption and
restart of execution is possible, or modifying an existing library to
support this.</p>

<p>Even though modifying a library will make upgrading and patching of
the library much harder, the benefits are significant. When executing e.g.
regular expressions, the same thread that actually is executing the
beam code will be utilized, why setup time and overhead in general is
kept at a minimum. Of course execution time of the regexp itself will
be slightly longer, as the implementation needs to keep track of the
number of executed iterations and needs to be prepared to store the
current state for later execution wakeup. The much smaller setup time
is however expected to be dominating when it comes to smaller regular
expressions (or rather expressions that involve a small number of
loops). One also has to bear in mind that this solution imposes much
less load on the operating system scheduler, which is a good thing for
large and/or embedded systems.</p>

<p>For operating systems where no kernel threads are available, the first
solution is the only acceptable. Separate threads for pure user space
code execution will do more harm than good to the realtime properties
of the Erlang system.</p>

          Selecting a suitable library to integrate <a href="#selecting-a-suitable-library-to-integrate">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>The library to integrate into the virtual machine should in an ideal
situation fulfill the following wishes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interruptible, the execution of the regular expression match should
stop after a certain amount of iterations and should then be
restartable at a later time.</li>
  <li>The library should be implemented in plain C, not any other language
or extension.</li>
  <li>The C implementation should be non-recursive.</li>
  <li>The library should implement modern (Perl like) regular expression
syntax.</li>
  <li>The library should be efficient.</li>
  <li>The library should provide Unicode support.</li>
</ul>

<p>No available regular expression library currently provides a perfect
match. The best available is the <a href="http://www.pcre.org/" title="The PCRE homepage">PCRE</a> library, which has compile time
options for not using the C stack, Perl (and Python) compatible
regular expressions and also is written in a well structured way,
making it suitable for integration, porting and implementing
extensions needed in the Erlang case.</p>

<p>Other alternatives include rxlib (no longer maintained), the Tcl/Tk
regular expression implementation, GNU regex, Jakarta and Onigurama,
among others. Of those the Tcl/Tk implementation seems the most
promising, especially as it for many situations is much faster than
other implementations. The algorithms and code are however quite
incomprehensible and the regular expression flavor not the most
widespread.</p>

<p>After having had a good look at the alternatives, I came to the
conclusion that PCRE was the best choice for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The code is maintained, very readable and easy to work with.</li>
  <li>The library is fast, although not the fastest.</li>
  <li>Extensive test suites.</li>
  <li>Perl compatible syntax.</li>
  <li>Widely spread: Used in Apache, PHP, Apple Safari etc.</li>
  <li>The regexp engine is pure C.</li>
  <li>Unicode support (UTF-8) which fits nicely into the suggested
Unicode representation in Erlang (<a href="eep-0010.md" title="EEP 10">EEP 10</a>).</li>
  <li>Recursion on the C stack can be avoided.</li>
  <li>The library has most of the infrastructure for an interruptible
execution of the expressions present, although restarting of
interrupted matches is not (yet) implemented.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the subjective reasoning about code readability might seem
somewhat out of place, the PCRE code base makes updates to the library
easier to integrate, as relatively few and comprehensible alterations
need to be done to the library to make it fit into the virtual
machine. To be able to maintain the library is important and being
able to understand the code is crucial.</p>

<p>The most appealing feature of the library is however the extensive
support for Perl compatible regular expressions. PCRE is certainly one
of the most powerful libraries around and Erlang programmers used to
Perl’s regular expressions will feel at home.</p>
      <h2 id="programmers-interface">
        
        
          Programmers interface <a href="#programmers-interface">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>In Perl, the regular expressions are integrated into the language
itself. This could of course be done in Erlang too. However, Erlang
already has syntax for matching structured data as well as binary
ditto. Introducing new primitives for string matching with regular
expressions seems out of place. Erlang is also not a language designed
for processing textual data in the way Perl is, but a language that
can handle complicated structured data. The bit-syntax however might
one day benefit from regular expression extensions, but that is beyond
the scope of this EEP.</p>

<p>A regular expression module interfacing with the library through built
in functions is the usual way to do it in Erlang, and that’s the way
this EEP suggests. As the module name regexp is already taken, the
abbreviation “re” for module name seems to be a good choice.</p>

<p>As a base implementation, I suggest a module with two basic functions:
one for precompiling a regular expression into “bytecode” for the
regular expression matching execution; and one for actually running
the regexp matching. The function that runs the matching should take
either a compiled regular expression, or the source of a regular
expression as input (together with the subject string and the options
for execution).</p>

<p>Around these two suggested functions one can implement functionality
in Erlang to mimic the existing regular expression library or
implement new functionality.</p>

<p>The current regexp module can, apart from matching, split a string
according to a regular expression (functionality similar to the Perl
built in function split) and do substitution of sub-strings based on
regular expression matching (like the s/<RE>/<String>/ expression in
Perl or awk). With corresponding functions in the "re" module, the new
module would provide all functionality of the old one.</String></RE></p>

<p>The names of the functions should, as much as possible, be chosen so
that mix up with the current regexp library functions is avoided, why I
suggest “compile” and “run” and “replace” as names for regexp
compilation, execution and substitution respectively. As no good
synonym for the name “split” has emerged, that name is retained in the
new module.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>This function compiles a regular expression with the syntax described below
into an internal format to be used later as a parameter to the run/2,3 functions.</p>

<p>Compiling the regular expression before matching is useful if the same
expression is to be used in matching against multiple subjects during the
program’s lifetime. Compiling once and executing many times is far more
efficient than compiling each time one wants to match.</p>

<p>The options have the following meanings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>anchored</code><br />
The pattern is forced to be “anchored”, that is, it is constrained to match
only at the first matching point in the string that is being searched
(the “subject string”). This effect can also be achieved by appropriate
constructs in the pattern itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>caseless</code><br />
Letters in the pattern match both upper and lower case letters.
It is equivalent to Perl’s <code>/i</code> option, and it can be changed within
a pattern by a <code>(?i)</code> option setting. Uppercase and lowercase letters
are defined as in the ISO-8859-1 character set.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>dollar_endonly</code><br />
A dollar metacharacter in the pattern matches only at the end of the subject
string. Without this option, a dollar also matches immediately before a newline
at the end of the string (but not before any other newlines). The dollar_endonly
option is ignored if multiline is given. There is no equivalent option in Perl,
and no way to set it within a pattern.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>dotall</code><br />
A dot maturate in the pattern matches all characters, including those that
indicate newline. Without it, a dot does not match when the current position
is at a newline. This option is equivalent to Perl’s <code>/s</code> option, and it
can be changed within a pattern by a <code>(?s)</code> option setting. A negative class
such as <code>[^a]</code> always matches newline characters,
independent of the setting of this option.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>extended</code><br />
Whitespace data characters in the pattern are ignored except when escaped or
inside a character class. Whitespace does not include the VT character
(ASCII 11). In addition, characters between an unescaped <code>#</code> outside a
character class and the next newline, inclusive, are also ignored. This is
equivalent to Perl’s <code>/x</code> option, and it can be changed within a pattern by
a <code>(?x)</code> option setting. This option makes it possible to include comments
inside complicated patterns. Note, however, that this applies only to data
characters. Whitespace characters may never appear within special character
sequences in a pattern, for example within the sequence <code>(?(</code> which introduces
a conditional subpattern.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>firstline</code><br />
An unanchored pattern is required to match before or at the first newline
in the subject string, though the matched text may continue over the newline.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>multiline</code><br />
By default, PCRE treats the subject string as consisting of a single line of
characters (even if it actually contains newlines). The “start of line”
metacharacter (<code>^</code>) matches only at the start of the string, while the
“end of line” metacharacter (<code>$</code>) matches only at the end of the string,
or before a terminating newline (unless dollar_endonly is given). This is
the same as Perl.</p>

    <p>When multiline it is given, the “start of line” and “end of line” constructs
match immediately following or immediately before internal newlines in the
subject string, respectively, as well as at the very start and end. This is
equivalent to Perl’s <code>/m</code> option, and it can be changed within a pattern by
a <code>(?m)</code> option setting. If there are no newlines in a subject string,
or no occurrences of <code>^</code> or <code>$</code> in a pattern, setting multiline has no effect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>no_auto_capture</code><br />
Disables the use of numbered capturing parentheses in the pattern.
Any opening parenthesis that is not followed by <code>?</code> behaves as if it were
followed by <code>?:</code> but named parentheses can still be used for capturing
(and they acquire numbers in the usual way). There is no equivalent
of this option in Perl.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>dupnames</code><br />
Names used to identify capturing subpatterns need not be unique.
This can be helpful for certain types of pattern when it is known
that only one instance of the named subpattern can ever be matched.
There are more details of named subpatterns below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>ungreedy</code><br />
This option inverts the “greediness” of the quantifiers so that they
are not greedy by default, but become greedy if followed by <code>?</code>.
It is not compatible with Perl. It can also be set by a <code>(?U)</code> option
setting within the pattern.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>{newline, NLSpec}</code><br />
Override the default definition of a newline in the subject string, which is LF (ASCII 10) in Erlang.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>cr</code><br />
Newline is indicated by a single character CR (ASCII 13)</li>
      <li><code>lf</code><br />
Newline is indicated by a single character LF (ASCII 10), the default</li>
      <li><code>crlf</code><br />

<p>Executes a regexp matching, returning <code>match</code> / <code>{match, Captured}</code> or
<code>nomatch</code>. The regular expression can be given either as iodata()
in which case it is automatically compiled (as by re:compile/2)
and executed, or as a pre compiled mp() in which case it is executed
against the subject directly.</p>

<p>When compilation is involved, the function may return compilation errors
as when compiling separately (<code>{error, {string(),int()}}</code>); when
only matching, no errors are returned.</p>

<p>If the regular expression is previously compiled, the option list can
only contain the options <code>anchored</code>, <code>global</code>, <code>notbol</code>, <code>noteol</code>, <code>notempty</code>,
<code>{offset, int()}</code>, <code>{newline, NLSpec}</code> and <code>{capture, ValueSpec}</code> /
<code>{capture, ValueSpec, Type}</code>. Otherwise all options valid for the
<code>re:compile/2</code> function are allowed as well. Options allowed both
for compilation and execution of a match, namely <code>anchored</code> and
<code>{newline, NLSpec}</code>, will affect both the compilation and execution
if present together with a non pre-compiled regular expression.</p>

<p>The <code>{capture, ValueSpec}</code> / <code>{capture, ValueSpec, Type}</code> defines
what to return from the function upon successful matching. The capture
tuple may contain both a value specification telling which of the captured
substrings are to be returned, and a type specification, telling how
captured substrings are to be returned (as index tuples, lists or binaries).
The capture option makes the function quite flexible and powerful.
The different options are described in detail below</p>

<p>If the capture options describe that no substring capturing at all is to be
done (<code>{capture, none}</code>), the function will return the single atom match
upon successful matching, otherwise the tuple <code>{match, ValueList}</code>
is returned. Disabling capturing can be done either by specifying
none or an empty list as ValueSpec.</p>

<p>A description of all the options relevant for execution follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>anchored</code><br />
Limits <code>re:run/3</code> to matching at the first matching position. If a pattern
was compiled with anchored, or turned out to be anchored by virtue of its
contents, it cannot be made unachored at matching time, hence there is no
unanchored option.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>global</code><br />
Implements global (repetitive) search as the <code>/g</code> flag in i.e. Perl.
Each match found is returned as a separate list() containing
the specific match as well as any matching subexpressions (or as
specified by the capture option). The Captured part of the return
value will hence be a list() of list()’s when this option is given.</p>

    <p>When the regular expression matches an empty string, the behaviour
might seem non-intuitive, why the behaviour requites some clarifying.
With the global option, <code>re:run/3</code> handles empty matches in the same way
as Perl, meaning that a match at any point giving an empty string
(with length 0) will be retried with the options <code>[anchored, notempty]</code>
as well. If that search gives a result of length &gt; 0, the result
is included. An example:</p>

    <pre><code>  re:run("cat","(|at)",[global]).
</code></pre>

    <p>The matching will be performed as following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>At offset 0</strong><br />
The regexp <code>(|at)</code> will first match at the initial position of
the string cat, giving the result set <code>[{0,0},{0,0}]</code> (the
second <code>{0,0}</code> is due to the subexpression marked by the
parentheses). As the length of the match is 0, we don’t
advance to the next position yet.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>At offset 0 with <code>[anchored, notempty]</code></strong><br />
The search is retried with the options [anchored, notempty] at
the same position, which does not give any interesting result of
longer length, why the search position is now advanced to the next
character (<code>a</code>).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>At offset 1</strong><br />
Now the search results in <code>[{1,0}, {1,0}]</code> meaning this search
will also be repeated with the extra options.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>At offset 1 with <code>[anchored, notempty]</code></strong><br />
Now the ab alternative is found and the result will be
<code>[{1,2}, {1,2}]</code>. The result is added to the list of results
and the position in the search string is advanced two steps.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>At offset 3</strong><br />
The search now once again matches the empty string,
giving <code>[{3,0}, {3,0}]</code>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>At offset 1 with `[anchored, notempty]</strong><br />
This will give no result of length &gt; 0 and we are at the last
position, so the global search is complete.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The result of the call is:</p>

    <p><code>{match,[[{0,0},{0,0}],[{1,0},{1,0}],[{1,2},{1,2}],[{3,0},{3,0}]]}</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>notempty</code><br />
An empty string is not considered to be a valid match if this option
is given. If there are alternatives in the pattern, they are tried.
If all the alternatives match the empty string, the entire match fails.
For example, if the pattern:</p>

    <pre><code>  a?b?
</code></pre>

    <p>is applied to a string not beginning with “a” or “b”, it matches the
empty string at the start of the subject. With notempty given,
this match is not valid, so <code>re:run/3</code> searches further into the string
for occurrences of “a” or “b”.</p>

    <p>Perl has no direct equivalent of notempty, but it does make a special
case of a pattern match of the empty string within its <code>split()</code> function,
and when using the <code>/g</code> modifier. It is possible to emulate Perl’s
behavior after matching a null string by first trying the match
again at the same offset with notempty and anchored, and then
if that fails by advancing the starting offset (see below)
and trying an ordinary match again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>notbol</code><br />
This option specifies that the first character of the subject string
is not the beginning of a line, so the circumflex metacharacter should
not match before it. Setting this without multiline (at compile time)
causes circumflex never to match. This option affects only the behavior
of the circumflex metacharacter. It does not affect <code>\A</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>noteol</code><br />
This option specifies that the end of the subject string is not the end
of a line, so the dollar metacharacter should not match it nor
(except in multiline mode) a newline immediately before it.
Setting this without multiline (at compile time) causes dollar
never to match. This option affects only the behavior of the dollar
metacharacter. It does not affect <code>\Z</code> or <code>\z</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>{offset , int()}</code><br />
Start matching at the offset (position) given in the subject string.
The offset is zero-based, so that the default is <code>{offset,0}</code>
(all of the subject string).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>{newline, NLSpec}</code><br />
Override the default definition of a newline in the subject string,
which is LF (ASCII 10) in Erlang.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>cr</code><br />
Newline is indicated by a single character CR (ASCII 13).</li>
      <li><code>lf</code><br />
Newline is indicated by a single character LF (ASCII 10),
the default.</li>
      <li><code>crlf</code><br />
Newline is indicated by the two-character CRLF
(ASCII 13 followed by ASCII 10) sequence.</li>
      <li><code>anycrlf</code><br />
Any of the three preceding sequences should be recognized</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>{capture, ValueSpec}</code> / <code>{capture, ValueSpec, Type}</code><br />
Specifies which captured substrings are returned and in what format.
By default, <code>re:run/3</code> captures all of the matching part of the substring
as well as all capturing subpatterns (all of the pattern is
automatically captured). The default return type is (zero-based)
indexes of the captured parts of the string, given as <code>{Offset,Length}</code>
pairs (the index Type of capturing).</p>

    <p>As an example of the default behavior, the following call:</p>

    <pre><code>  re:run("ABCabcdABC","abcd",[]).
</code></pre>

    <p>returns, as first and only captured string the matching part of
the subject (“abcd” in the middle) as a index pair <code>{3,4}</code>, where
character positions are zero based, just as in offsets. The return
value of the call above would then be:</p>

    <pre><code>  {match,[{3,4}]}
</code></pre>

    <p>Another (and quite common) case is where the regular expression
matches all of the subject, as in:</p>

    <pre><code>  re:run("ABCabcdABC",".*abcd.*",[]).
</code></pre>

    <p>where the return value correspondingly will point out all of the string,
beginning at index 0 and being 10 characters long:</p>

    <pre><code>  {match,[{0,10}]}
</code></pre>

    <p>If the regular expression contains capturing subpatterns,
like in the following case:</p>

    <pre><code>  re:run("ABCabcdABC",".*(abcd).*",[]).
</code></pre>

    <p>all of the matched subject is captured, as well as
the captured substrings:</p>

    <pre><code>  {match,[{0,10},{3,4}]}
</code></pre>

    <p>the complete matching pattern always giving the first return value in
the list and the rest of the subpatterns being added in the order they
occurred in the regular expression.</p>

    <p>The capture tuple is built up as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><code>ValueSpec</code><br />
Specifies which captured (sub)patterns are to be returned.
The <code>ValueSpec</code> can either be an atom describing a predefined set
of return values, or a list containing either the indexes or the
names of specific subpatterns to return.</p>

        <p>The predefined sets of subpatterns are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><code>all</code><br />
All captured subpatterns including the complete matching string.
This is the default.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><code>first</code><br />
Only the first captured subpattern, which is always the complete
matching part of the subject. All explicitly captured subpatterns
are discarded.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><code>all_but_first</code><br />
All but the first matching subpattern, i.e. all explicitly
captured subpatterns, but not the complete matching part of the
subject string. This is useful if the regular expression as
a whole matches a large part of the subject, but the part you’re
interested in is in an explicitly captured subpattern.
If the return type is list or binary, not returning subpatterns
you’re not interested in is a good way to optimize.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><code>none</code><br />
Do not return matching subpatterns at all, yielding the single
atom match as the return value of the function when matching
successfully instead of the {match, list()} return. Specifying
an empty list gives the same behavior.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The value list is a list of indexes for the subpatterns to return,
where index 0 is for all of the pattern, and 1 is for the first
explicit capturing subpattern in the regular expression,
and so forth. When using named captured subpatterns (see below)
in the regular expression, one can use <code>atom()</code>’s or <code>string()</code>’s
to specify the subpatterns to be returned. This deserves an example,
consider the following regular expression:</p>

        <pre><code>  ".*(abcd).*"
</code></pre>

        <p>matched against the string <code>"ABCabcdABC"</code>, capturing only the
<code>"abcd"</code> part (the first explicit subpattern):</p>

        <pre><code>  re:run("ABCabcdABC",".*(abcd).*",[{capture,[1]}]).
</code></pre>

        <p>The call will yield the following result:</p>

        <pre><code>  {match,[{3,4}]}
</code></pre>

        <p>as the first explicitly captured subpattern is <code>"(abcd)"</code>,
matching <code>"abcd"</code> in the subject, at (zero-based) position 3,
of length 4.</p>

        <p>Now consider the same regular expression, but with the subpattern
explicitly named <code>'FOO'</code>:</p>

        <pre><code>  ".*(?&lt;FOO&gt;abcd).*"
</code></pre>

        <p>With this expression, we could still give the index of the subpattern
with the following call:</p>

        <pre><code>  re:run("ABCabcdABC",".*(?&lt;FOO&gt;abcd).*",[{capture,[1]}]).
</code></pre>

        <p>giving the same result as before. But as the subpattern is named,
we can also give its name in the value list:</p>

        <pre><code>  re:run("ABCabcdABC",".*(?&lt;FOO&gt;abcd).*",[{capture,['FOO']}]).
</code></pre>

        <p>which would yield the same result as the earlier examples, namely:</p>

        <pre><code>  {match,[{3,4}]}
</code></pre>

        <p>The values list might specify indexes or names not present in the
regular expression, in which case the return values vary depending
on the type. If the type is <code>index</code>, the tuple <code>{-1,0}</code> is returned
for values having no corresponding subpattern in the regexp, but for
the other types (binary and list), the values are the empty binary
or list respectively.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>Type</code><br />
Optionally specifies how captured substrings are to be returned.
If omitted, the default of index is used. The Type can be one of
the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><code>index</code><br />
Return captured substrings as pairs of byte indexes into
the subject string and length of the matching string in
the subject (as if the subject string was flattened with
iolist_to_binary prior to matching). This is the default.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><code>list</code><br />
Return matching substrings as lists of characters
(Erlang <code>string()</code>’s).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><code>binary</code><br />
Return matching substrings as binaries.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In general, subpatterns that got assigned no value in the match
are returned as the tuple <code>{-1,0}</code> when type is <code>index</code>.
Unasigned subpatterns are returned as the empty binary or list
respectively for other return types. Consider the regular expression:</p>

    <pre><code>  ".*((?&lt;FOO&gt;abdd)|a(..d)).*"
</code></pre>

    <p>There are three explicitly capturing subpatterns, where the opening
parenthesis position determines the order in the result,
hence <code>"((?&lt;FOO&gt;abdd)|a(..d))"</code> is subpattern index 1,
<code>"(?&lt;FOO&gt;abdd)"</code> is subpattern index 2 and <code>"(..d)"</code>
is subpattern index 3. When matched against the following string:</p>

    <pre><code>  "ABCabcdABC"
</code></pre>

    <p>the subpattern at index 2 won’t match, as <code>"abdd"</code> is not present
in the string, but the complete pattern matches (due to the alternative
<code>"a(..d)"</code>. The subpattern at index 2 is therefore unassigned and
the default return value will be:</p>

    <pre><code>  {match,[{0,10},{3,4},{-1,0},{4,3}]}
</code></pre>

    <p>Setting the capture Type to binary would give the following:</p>

    <pre><code>  {match,[&lt;&lt;"ABCabcdABC"&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;"abcd"&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;"bcd"&gt;&gt;]}
</code></pre>

    <p>where the empty binary (<code>&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;</code>) represents the unassigned subpattern.
In the binary case, some information about the matching is therefore lost,
the <code>&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;</code> might just as well be an empty string captured.</p>

    <p>If differentiation between empty matches and non existing subpatterns
is necessary, use the type index and do the conversion to
the final type in Erlang code.</p>

    <p>When the option global is given, the capture specification affects each
match separately, so that:</p>

    <pre><code>  re:run("cacb","c(a|b)",[global,{capture,[1],list}]).
</code></pre>

    <p>gives the result:</p>

    <p><code>{match,[["a"],["b"]]}</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

         {offset, int()} | {newline, NLSpec} | {return, ReturnType} |

</code></pre>

<p>This function splits the input into parts by finding tokens according to
the regular expression supplied.</p>

<p>The splitting is done basically by running a global regexp match and dividing
the initial string wherever a match occurs. The matching part of the string
is removed from the output.</p>

<p>The result is given as a list of “strings”, the preferred datatype given in
the return option (default <code>iodata</code>).</p>

<p>If subexpressions are given in the regular expression, the matching
subexpressions are returned in the resulting list as well. An example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">re:split("Erlang","[ln]",[{return,list}]).
</code></pre>

<p>will yield the result:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">["Er","a","g"]
</code></pre>

<p>while:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">re:split("Erlang","([ln])",[{return,list}]).
</code></pre>

<p>will yield:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">["Er","l","a","n","g"]
</code></pre>

<p>The text matching the subexpression (marked by the parentheses in the regexp)
is inserted in the result list where it was found. In effect this means that
concatenating the result of a split where the whole regexp is
a single subexpression (as in the example above) will always
result in the original string.</p>

<p>As there is no matching subexpression for the last part in the example
(the <code>"g"</code>), there is nothing inserted after that. To make the group of
strings and the parts matching the subexpressions more obvious, one might use
the group option, which groups together the part of the subject string with
the parts matching the subexpressions when the string was split:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">re:split("Erlang","([ln])",[{return,list},group]).
</code></pre>

<p>gives:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">[["Er","l"],["a","n"],["g"]]
</code></pre>

<p>Here the regular expression matched first the <code>"l"</code>, causing <code>"Er"</code> to be
the first part in the result. When the regular expression matched,
the (only) subexpression was bound to the <code>"l"</code>, why the <code>"l"</code> is inserted in
the group together with <code>"Er"</code>. The next match is of the <code>"n"</code>, making <code>"a"</code>
the next part to be returned. As the subexpression is bound to
the substring <code>"n"</code> in this case, the <code>"n"</code> is inserted into this group.
The last group consists of the rest of the string, as no more matches are found.</p>

<p>All empty strings are per default removed from the end of the result list,
the semantics being that we split the string in as many parts as possible
until we reach the end of the string. In effect this means that all empty
strings are stripped from the result list (or all empty groups if the group
option is given). The <code>parts</code> option can be used to change this behaviour.
Let’s look at an example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">re:split("Erlang","[lg]",[{return,list}]).
</code></pre>

<p>The result will be:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">["Er","an"]
</code></pre>

<p>as the matching of the “g” in the end effectively makes the matching reach
the end of the string. If we however say we want more parts:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">re:split("Erlang","[lg]",[{return,list},{parts,3}]).
</code></pre>

<p>We will get the last part as well, even though there is only an empty string
after the last match (matching the <code>"g"</code>):</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">["Er","an",[]]
</code></pre>

<p>More than three parts are not possible with this indata, why:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">re:split("Erlang","[lg]",[{return,list},{parts,4}]).
</code></pre>

<p>will give the same result. To specify that as many results as possible
are to be returned, including any empty results at end, you can specify
infinity as the number of parts to return. Specifying 0 as the number of
parts gives the default behaviour of returning all parts except empty
parts at the end.</p>

<p>If subexpressions are captured, empty subexpression matches at the end
are also stripped from the result if <code>{parts, N}</code> is not specified.
If you are familiar with Perl, the default behaviour corresponds exactly
to the Perl default, the <code>{parts, N}</code> where <code>N</code> is a positive integer
corresponds exactly to the Perl behaviour with a positive numerical
third parameter and the {parts, infinity} behaviour corresponds to that
when the Perl routine is given a negative integer as the third parameter.</p>

<p>Summary of options not previously described for the <code>re:run/3</code> function:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>{return, ReturnType}</code><br />
Specifies how the parts of the original string are presented in
the result list. The possible types are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>iodata</code><br />
The variant of iodata() that gives the least copying of data with
the current implementation (often a binary, but don’t depend on it).</li>
      <li><code>binary</code><br />
All parts returned as binaries.</li>
      <li><code>list</code><br />
All parts returned as lists of characters (“strings”).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>group</code><br />
Groups together the part of the string with the parts of the string
matching the subexpressions of the regexp.</p>

    <p>The return value from the function will in this case be a <code>list()</code>
of <code>list()</code>’s. Each sublist begins with the string picked out of
the subject string, followed by the parts matching each of
the subexpressions in order of occurrence in the regular expression.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>{parts, N}</code><br />
Specifies the number of parts the subject string is to be split into.</p>

    <p>The number of parts should be 0 for the default behaviour
“as many as there are, skipping empty parts at the end”, a positive
integer for a specific maximum on the number of parts and infinity for
the maximum number of parts possible, regardless of if the parts are
empty strings at the end.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As can be viewed in the manual excerpt, I suggest allowing both the
regular expressions and the subject strings to be provided as
<code>iodata()</code>, which means either binaries, lists or a mix of binaries
and deep lists. When Unicode is not involved, this basically means a
implicit <code>iolist_to_binary()</code> when supplying data to the re module.</p>
      <h3 id="further-extensions">
        
        
          Further extensions <a href="#further-extensions">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>The following extensions are not yet implemented in the prototype, but
should be included in a final release:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Unicode support. Unicode strings should be represented as suggested
in <a href="eep-0010.md" title="EEP 10">EEP 10</a>, which means either UTF-8 in binaries, lists of Unicode
characters as integers, or a mix thereof. If the regular expression
was compiled for Unicode or a <code>unicode</code> option is supplied when
compiling and running in one go, the data is expected to be in one
of the supported Unicode formats, otherwise a <code>badarg</code> exception
will be thrown.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Match predicates to make it easy to use regular expressions in
logical Erlang expressions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Of these, Unicode support is the far most important, and also the one
that can not be implemented efficiently purely in Erlang code.</p>
      <h2 id="prototype-implementation">
        
        
          Prototype implementation <a href="#prototype-implementation">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>A prototype implementation using the PCRE library is present along
with a reference manual page in the R12B-4 distribution. This
implementation does not yet fully support Unicode, as <a href="eep-0010.md" title="EEP 10">EEP 10</a> is not
accepted at the time of writing. The prototype implementation also
lacks the “split” function, which was implemented after the R12B-4 release.</p>

<p>In terms of performance, fairly simple regular expressions matches are
with this prototype up to 75 times faster than with the current regexp
module. The bookkeeping to allow for interruptions of the regular
expression execution costs between 1 and 2% of the performance when no
out scheduling is needed. In worst cases a 5% performance loss can be
noted compared to an untouched library, but then actual restarting is
involved, so the numbers are not fully comparable.</p>

<p>Compiling PCRE to use the C stack for recursive calls and avoid
restarting is expected to give the best results in terms of execution
speed. The difference in benchmarks to the fully interruptible version
is however only in the range of 1 to 3% when no restarting occurs and
still no more than 6% when restarting actually occurs.</p>

<p>The conclusion is that the extra cost imposed on the PCRE library to
allow an integration into the Erlang emulator without using
asynchronous threads is in an absolute worst scenario no more than 6%
compared to a theoretical maximum.</p>
