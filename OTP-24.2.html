There are not yet any guaranties that it works, not even together with other OTP applications like for example SSL and SSH, although there are no known errors.\n\nCompiling and linking with OpenSSL 3.0 cryptolib in compatibility modes (for example to behave as 1.1.1) are not tested. It is not tested with external providers.\n\nThe support for FIPS mode does not yet work, and is disabled when compiled with OpenSSL 3.0.\n\nDeprecated functions in the OpenSSL 3.0 cryptolib must not be disabled as OTP/crypto still uses some of the deprecated API functions. The gcc flag -Wno-deprecated-declarations is set to prevent deprecation warnings to be printed when compiling.\n\nThe hash algorithms md4 and ripemd160 are disabled temporarily when compiled with OpenSSL 3.0.\n\nThe ciphers blowfish_cbc, blowfish_cfb64, blowfish_ecb, blowfish_ofb64, des_cbc, des_cfb, des_ecb, rc2_cbc and rc4 are disabled temporarily when compiled with OpenSSL 3.0.\n\n"

This since during these operations all processes on the system were scheduled for execution at once.\n\nThis problem has been fixed by introducing a limit on outstanding purge and copy literal requests in the system. By default this limit is set to twice the amount of schedulers on the system. This will ensure that schedulers will have enough work scheduled to perform these operations as quickly as possible at the same time as other work will be interleaved to a much higher degree. Performance of these operations will however be somewhat degraded due to the overhead of enforcing this limit compared to when using a very large limit.\n\nThis limit can be set by passing the +zosrl command line argument to erl, or by calling erlang:system_flag(outstanding_system_requests_limit, NewLimit).\n\n"
