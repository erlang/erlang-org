        release_note: "For various error types, the compiler now tries to suggest potential fixes by\nadding \"did you mean ...?\" at the end of error messages.\n\nWhen a function is used with wrong arity, the compiler will try to suggest a\ndefined function with the same name but a different arity. For example, given\nthe following module:\n\n```\n-module(typos).\n-export([t/0]).\nbar(A) -> A.\nbar(A,A,A) -> A.\nbar(A,A,A,A) -> A.\nt() -> bar(0, 0).\n```\n\nThe compiler will emit the following message:\n\n```\ntypo.erl:6:12: function bar/2 undefined, did you mean bar/1,3,4?\n%   6|     t() -> bar(0, 0).\n%    |            ^\n```\n\nFor compiler errors that can easily be caused by typos, the compiler will try\nto suggest what the correct variable or function name, could be. For example,\ngiven the following module:\n\n```\n-module(typos).\n-export([bar/2]).\n\nbar(A0, B0) ->\n    A + B.\n```\n\nthe compiler will emit the following error messages:\n\n```\ntypos.erl:5:5: variable 'A' is unbound, did you mean 'A0'?\n%    5|     A + B.\n%     |     ^\n\ntypos.erl:5:9: variable 'B' is unbound, did you mean 'B0'?\n%    5|     A + B.\n%     |         ^\n```\n\nError types that now suggest correct arities: `bad_inline`, `undefined_nif`,\n`bad_nowarn_unused_function`, `bad_nowarn_bif_clash`, `undefined_function`.\n\nError types that now suggest correct names: `bad_inline`, `undefined_nif`,\n`bad_nowarn_unused_function`, `undefined_on_load`, `undefined_function`,\n`undefined_record`, `undefined_field`, `unbound_var`.\n\nUsing a function with wrong arity has higher precedence than having a typo in\nthe function name. If the compiler can find a defined function with the same\nname but a different arity, it will not suggest a defined function with a\nclose-enough name, regardless of arity.\n\n"

        release_note: "[EEP-69: Nominal Types] has been implemented. As a side effect, nominal types\ncan encode opaque types. We changed all opaque-handling logic and improved\nopaque warnings in Dialyzer.\n\nAll existing Erlang type systems are structural: two types are seen as\nequivalent if their structures are the same. Type comparisons are based on the\nstructures of the types, not on how the user explicitly defines them. For\nexample, in the following example, `meter()` and `foot()` are equivalent. The\ntwo types can be used interchangeably. Neither of them differ from the basic\ntype `integer()`.\n\n```\n-type meter() :: integer().\n-type foot() :: integer().\n```\n\nNominal typing is an alternative type system, where two types are equivalent\nif and only if they are declared with the same type name. The EEP proposes one\nnew syntax -nominal for declaring nominal types. Under nominal typing,\n`meter()` and `foot()` are no longer compatible. Whenever a function expects\ntype `meter()`, passing in type `foot()` would result in a Dialyzer error.\n\n```\n-nominal meter() :: integer().\n-nominal foot() :: integer().\n```\n\nMore nominal type-checking rules can be found in the EEP. It is worth noting\nthat most work for adding nominal types and type-checking is in\n`erl_types.erl`. The rest are changes that removed the previous opaque\ntype-checking, and added an improved version of it using nominal type-checking\nwith reworked warnings.\n\nBackwards compatibility for opaque type-checking is not preserved by this PR.\nPrevious opaque warnings can appear with slightly different wordings. A new\nkind of opaque warning `opaque_union` is added, together with a Dialyzer\noption `no_opaque_union` to turn this kind of warnings off.\n\n[EEP-69: Nominal Types]: https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0069"

When given,\n  most optimizations are disabled and debug information suitable for the\n  native debugger are added to generated BEAM files.\n- A new `+D` emulator flag. When given, the VM becomes \"debuggable\", which\n  means that when modules that been compiled with the `beam_debug_info` option\n  are loaded, the code is instrumented so that one can enable and disable\n  breakpoints on executable lines.\n- An experimental `erl_debugger` module with a new debugging API. Essentially,\n  it allows a single, local, process to be registered as the \"debugger\"\n  process for the node. This process is the one that will receive messages\n  notifying that a process hit a breakpoint. This way, the front-end\n  implementation of a debugger (such as [edb from WhatApp]) can be decoupled\n  from OTP.\n- The `erl_debugger` module also exposes new BIFs to inspect `X` and `Y`\n  registers of a suspended process.
