      OTP-17843:
        release_note: "By default global does not take any actions to restore a fully connected network when connections are lost due to network issues. This is problematic for all applications expecting a fully connected network to be provided, such as for example mnesia, but also for global itself. A network of overlapping partitions might cause the internal state of global to become inconsistent. Such an inconsistency can remain even after such partitions have been brought together to form a fully connected network again. The effect on other applications that expects that a fully connected network is maintained may vary, but they might misbehave in very subtle hard to detect ways during such a partitioning.\n\nIn order to prevent such issues, we have introduced a prevent overlapping partitions fix which can be enabled using the prevent_overlapping_partitions kernel(6) parameter. When this fix has been enabled, global will actively disconnect from nodes that reports that they have lost connections to other nodes. This will cause fully connected partitions to form instead of leaving the network in a state with overlapping partitions. Note that this fix has to be enabled on all nodes in the network in order to work properly. Since this quite substantially changes the behavior, this fix is currently disabled by default. Since you might get hard to detect issues without this fix you are, however, strongly advised to enable this fix in order to avoid issues such as the ones described above. As of OTP 25 this fix will become enabled by default.\n\n"
