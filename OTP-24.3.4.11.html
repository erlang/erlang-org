        release_note: "Fix bug in binary_to_term (and distributed receive) when decoding a large map (>32 keys) with unsorted small maps (<= 32) as keys of the large map.\n\nThis was only a problem if the term was encoded by erl_interface, jinterface or otherwise, as the VM itself always encodes small maps with sorted keys.\n\nThe \"binary_to_term\" would appear as successful but the created large map was internally inconsistent. The smaller key-maps could not be found with maps:get and friends. Other operations such as map compare and merge could probably also give incorrect results.\n\n"
