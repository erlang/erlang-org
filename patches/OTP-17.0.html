--- HIGHLIGHTS ----------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11334  == erts ose kernel ==

	      Erlang/OTP has been ported to the realtime operating system
	      OSE. The port supports both smp and non-smp emulator. For
	      details around the port and how to started see the User's
	      Guide in the ose application. 

	      Note that not all parts of Erlang/OTP has been ported. 

	      Notable things that work are: non-smp and smp emulators, OSE
	      signal interaction, crypto, asn1, run_erl/to_erl, tcp, epmd,
	      distribution and most if not all non-os specific
	      functionality of Erlang.

	      Notable things that does not work are: udp/sctp, os_mon,
	      erl_interface, binding of schedulers.

   OTP-11368  == erts kernel ==

	      Add the {active,N} socket option for TCP, UDP, and SCTP,
	      where N is an integer in the range -32768..32767, to allow a
	      caller to specify the number of data messages to be delivered
	      to the controlling process. Once the socket's delivered
	      message count either reaches 0 or is explicitly set to 0 with
	      inet:setopts/2 or by including {active,0} as an option when
	      the socket is created, the socket transitions to passive
	      ({active, false}) mode and the socket's controlling process
	      receives a message to inform it of the transition. TCP
	      sockets receive {tcp_passive,Socket}, UDP sockets receive
	      {udp_passive,Socket} and SCTP sockets receive
	      {sctp_passive,Socket}. 

	      The socket's delivered message counter defaults to 0, but it
	      can be set using {active,N} via any gen_tcp, gen_udp, or
	      gen_sctp function that takes socket options as arguments, or
	      via inet:setopts/2. New N values are added to the socket's
	      current counter value, and negative numbers can be used to
	      reduce the counter value. Specifying a number that would
	      cause the socket's counter value to go above 32767 causes an
	      einval error. If a negative number is specified such that the
	      counter value would become negative, the socket's counter
	      value is set to 0 and the socket transitions to passive mode.
	      If the counter value is already 0 and inet:setopts(Socket,
	      [{active,0}]) is specified, the counter value remains at 0
	      but the appropriate passive mode transition message is
	      generated for the socket.

	      Thanks to Steve Vinoski

   OTP-11594  == asn1 ==

	      The OCTET STRING and BIT STRING types now have a more natural
	      mapping to Erlang types (binary and bitstring, respectively),
	      which is more efficient and will avoid useless conversions
	      between lists and binaries/bitstrings.

	      This is an incompatible change. To revert to the old mapping
	      to support existing applications, use the legacy_erlang_types
	      option.

	      Impact: There is a potential for better performance, as it is
	      now possible to avoid conversions between lists and binaries
	      both in the generated ASN.1 encode/decode code and in the
	      application itself.

   OTP-11615  == otp ==

	      A new version scheme for OTP as well as all applications in
	      OTP has been introduced. The version scheme is described in
	      the versions chapter of the system principles guide in the
	      OTP documentation.

   OTP-11616  == erts stdlib hipe dialyzer compiler typer ==

	      EEP43: New data type - Maps

	      With Maps you may for instance:

	      -- M0 = #{ a => 1, b => 2}, % create associations

	      -- M1 = M0#{ a := 10 }, % update values

	      -- M2 = M1#{ "hi" => "hello"}, % add new associations

	      -- #{ "hi" := V1, a := V2, b := V3} = M2. % match keys with
	      values

	      For information on how to use Maps please see the Reference
	      Manual.

	      The current implementation is without the following features:

	      -- No variable keys

	      -- No single value access

	      -- No map comprehensions

	      Note that Maps is experimental during OTP 17.0.

   OTP-11777  == erts ==

	      Halfword emulator is marked as deprecated. It still works as
	      before but is planned to be removed in a future major
	      release.

--- POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITIES -----------------------------------------

   OTP-10915  == appmon debugger dialyzer et observer pman toolbar tv ==

	      Removed gs based applications and gs based backends. The
	      observer application replaces the removed applications.

   OTP-11082  == erts ==

	      A common case is to wrap an argument to list_to_binary/1 in a
	      list to ensure conversion can happen even though the argument
	      may already be a binary. Take special care of this case and
	      do not copy binary.

	      Impact: May cause incompatibility since a single binary is no
	      longer copied. Use binary:copy/1,2 instead.

   OTP-11179  == observer ==

	      The crashdump_viewer is re-written using wx. The old webtool
	      interface for crashdump_viewer does no longer exist.

   OTP-11204  == erts stdlib ==

	      The version of the PCRE library Used by Erlang's re module is
	      raised to 8.33 from 7.6. This means, among other things,
	      better Unicode and Unicode Character Properties support. New
	      options connected to PCRE 8.33 are also added to the re
	      module (ucd, notempty_atstart, no_start_optimize). PCRE has
	      extended the regular expression syntax between 7.6 and 8.33,
	      why this imposes a potential incompatibility. Only very
	      complicated regular expressions may be affected, but if you
	      know you are using obscure features, please test run your
	      regular expressions and verify that their behavior has not
	      changed.

   OTP-11593  == diameter ==

	      Change interface for communicating outbound stream id to
	      diameter_sctp

	      The module uses the transport_data field of record
	      diameter_packet to communicate the stream on which the an
	      incoming message is received and on which an outgoing message
	      should be sent, the previous interface being that both are
	      communicated as a tuple of the form {stream, Id}. However,
	      since diameter retains the value of an incoming request's
	      transport_data unless the corresponding answer message
	      specifies otherwise, the behaviour in this case is to send an
	      answer on the outbound stream with the same identifier as the
	      that of the inbound stream on which the request was received.
	      If the inbound stream id is greater than or equal to the
	      number of outbound streams then this is guaranteed to fail,
	      causing the transport process in question to terminate. There
	      is no relationship between inbound and outbound stream
	      identifiers so diameter_sctp's imposition of one is simply
	      wrong.

	      Outbound stream ids are now communicated with a different
	      tuple: {outstream, Id}, interpreted modulo the number of
	      outbound streams. Thus, retention of an inbound request's
	      transport_data has no effect on the selection of an outbound
	      stream.

	      The change in interface is not strictly backwards compatible
	      because of the new atom for the outbound stream. However, as
	      there is currently no documented way of obtaining the
	      available number of outbound streams for a peer connection,
	      there is no way for a client to have known the range of ids
	      from which it could reliably have chosen with the previous
	      interface, so any setting of the outbound stream has probably
	      been unintentional. Not explicitly specifying an outbound
	      stream now results in a round-robin selection.

	      Thanks to Sharmila Pillai for reporting the problem.

   OTP-11594  == asn1 ==

	      The OCTET STRING and BIT STRING types now have a more natural
	      mapping to Erlang types (binary and bitstring, respectively),
	      which is more efficient and will avoid useless conversions
	      between lists and binaries/bitstrings.

	      This is an incompatible change. To revert to the old mapping
	      to support existing applications, use the legacy_erlang_types
	      option.

	      Impact: There is a potential for better performance, as it is
	      now possible to avoid conversions between lists and binaries
	      both in the generated ASN.1 encode/decode code and in the
	      application itself.

   OTP-11612  == erts ==

	      +fnaw is now default when starting the emulator; it used to
	      be +fnl.

              Selection between +fnl and +fnu is done based on the current
              locale settings in the OS, meaning that if you have set your
              terminal for UTF-8 encoding, the filesystem is expected to
              use the same encoding for file names.

   OTP-11628  == erts ==

	      The previously deprecated driver API function
	      driver_async_cancel() has been removed. Due to this, the
	      driver API version has been bumped to 3.0.

	      Thanks to Steve Vinoski.

   OTP-11639  == erts ==

	      sendfile no longer uses async threads by default

	      This has been done because a slow client attack is possible
	      if the async thread pool is used. The scenario is:

	      Client does a request for a file and then slowly receives the
	      file one byte at a time. This will eventually fill the async
	      thread pool with blocking sendfile operations and thus
	      starving the vm of all file operations.

	      If you still want to use the async threads pool for sendfile
	      an option to enable it has been introduced.

	      Thanks to Christopher Faulet for identifying this
	      vulnerability.

   OTP-11716  == sasl ==

	      The upgrade instruction 'restart_application' would earlier
	      ignore the restart type configured in the .rel file and
	      always restart the application as permanent. This is now
	      changed, and the restart type from the .rel file is used. If
	      restart type is 'load', the application will only be loaded
	      and not started. If the restart type is 'none', the
	      application will not be loaded nor started, but all modules
	      in the application will be loaded. (Thanks to Tobias Schlager
	      for reporting this problem)

   OTP-11719  == otp ==

	      The default encoding of Erlang files has been changed from
	      ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8.

	      The encoding of XML files has also been changed to UTF-8.

   OTP-11723  == erts ==

	      Changed the default configuration when configuring with
	      $ERL_TOP/configure to be the same as when configuring with
	      $ERL_TOP/otp_build configure.

	      Previously floating point exceptions got enabled by default
	      on Linux when HiPE was enabled when configuring with
	      $ERL_TOP/configure, but not when configuring with
	      $ERL_TOP/otp_build configure. The default is now in both
	      cases not to use floating point exceptions since there still
	      exist unresolved issues with floating point exceptions on
	      Linux.

	      For more information see $ERL_TOP/HOWTO/INSTALL.md.

   OTP-11727  == asn1 ==

	      When specifying the value for an OCTET STRING in a
	      specification, the ASN.1 standard clearly states that the
	      value must be either a bstring or an hstring, but NOT a
	      cstring. The ASN.1 compiler will now generate a compilation
	      error if the value of an OCTET STRING is given as a character
	      string.

	      That is, the following example is now illegal:

	      string OCTET STRING ::= "Now illegal"

   OTP-11732  == common_test ==

	      Test case group name information has been added to the data
	      sent with tc_user_skip and tc_auto_skip event messages, as
	      well as the data passed in calls to the CT Hook functions
	      on_tc_skip/3 and on_tc_fail/3. The modification only affects
	      the function name element/argument. This value remains an
	      atom if the test case in question does not belong to a test
	      case group. Otherwise a tuple {FuncName,GroupName}
	      ({atom(),atom()}) is passed instead.

	      Note that this change may (depending on the patterns used for
	      matching) require modifications of user event handlers and
	      hook modules. Please see the Event Handling chapter in the
	      Common Test User's Guide, and the reference manual for
	      ct_hooks, for details.

	      Note also that the Test Server framework callback function
	      report/2 has been modified. This change only affects users
	      with test frameworks interfacing Test Server rather than
	      Common Test. See the test_server_ctrl reference manual for
	      details.

   OTP-11738  == erts ==

	      The default float encoding in binary_to_term and
	      external_size has been changed to use minor_mode 1 instead of
	      0.

   OTP-11771  == stdlib ==

	      The Erlang Code Linter (erl_lint) has since Erlang/OTP R13B
	      emitted warnings whenever any of the types arity(),
	      bitstring(), iodata(), or boolean() were re-defined. Now
	      errors are emitted instead.

   OTP-11782  == erts ==

	      The external format for Maps has changed in a way that is not
	      compatible with the format used in OTP 17.0-rc1 and OTP
	      17.0-rc2.

   OTP-11817  == stdlib ==

	      The functions sys:get_state/1,2 and sys:replace_state/2,3 are
	      fixed so they can now be run while the process is sys
	      suspended. To accomplish this, the new callbacks
	      Mod:system_get_state/1 and Mod:system_replace_state/2 are
	      added, which are also implemented by the generic behaviours
	      gen_server, gen_event and gen_fsm.

	      The potential incompatibility refers to

	      -- The previous behaviour of intercepting the system message
	      and passing a tuple of size 2 as the last argument to
	      sys:handle_system_msg/6 is no longer supported.

	      -- The error handling when StateFun in sys:replace_state/2,3
	      fails is changed from being totally silent to possibly (if
	      the callback module does not catch) throw an exception in the
	      client process.

	      (Thanks to James Fish and Steve Vinoski)

--- otp -----------------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11537  Funs can now be a given a name. Thanks to to Richard O'Keefe
	      for the idea (EEP37) and to Anthony Ramine for the
	      implementation.

   OTP-11606  Documentation correction in special processes chapter (Thanks
	      to Alexander Zhuravlev)

   OTP-11615  A new version scheme for OTP as well as all applications in
	      OTP has been introduced. The version scheme is described in
	      the versions chapter of the system principles guide in the
	      OTP documentation.

   OTP-11637  Fixed bug in example code in the Distributed Erlang chapter.
	      (Thanks to Loïc Hoguin.)

   OTP-11657  The -callback attribute is now mentioned in the reference
	      manual, in section Behaviour Module Attribute. (Thanks to
	      Vance Shipley for mentioning the omission.)

   OTP-11683  A new make target called "distclean" is added. This new
	      target removes files created by configure

   OTP-11713  The OTP documentation can now be built the same way in a
	      cross built source tree as in a native built source tree. For
	      more information see $ERL_TOP/HOWTO/INSTALL.md.

   OTP-11717  Some more documentation is added to explain the behavior when
	      an upgrade includes new versions of ERTS, Kernel, STDLIB or
	      SASL.

   OTP-11719  The default encoding of Erlang files has been changed from
	      ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8.

	      The encoding of XML files has also been changed to UTF-8.

   OTP-11736  The release name in all delivered release resource files
	      (.rel) are changed to "Erlang/OTP". This is visible for
	      example in the return value from
	      release_handler:which_releases/0.

   OTP-11746  By default, silent rules are now default in configure.
	      (Thanks to Tuncer Ayaz.)

   OTP-11754  "Introducing Erlang " and "Learn You Some Erlang for Great
	      Good" is added to the list of books in the documentation
	      (Thanks to Byaruhanga Franklin)

   OTP-11773  The app-file key runtime_dependencies has been introduced.

	      Runtime dependencies have been added to all app-files in OTP.
	      Note that these may not be completely correct during OTP 17,
	      but this is actively being worked on.

	      The function system_information:sanity_check/0 will verify
	      all declared runtime dependencies in the system when called.

   OTP-11792  Clarification regarding autoconf in the INSTALL.md (Thanks to
	      Sage Imel)

   OTP-11805  Enable a cross compile Erlang/OTP platform to Android or
	      Raspberry PI using Android NDK. Port emulator and core
	      application to support target HW platform. Exclude any add-on
	      services required for OTP platform deployment into target
	      hardware due to device fragmentation and jail-break
	      requirements. (Thanks to Dmitry Kolesnikov)

--- appmon --------------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-10915  Removed gs based applications and gs based backends. The
	      observer application replaces the removed applications.

--- asn1-3.0 ------------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11258  By giving --enable-static-{nifs,drivers} to configure it is
	      now possible to statically linking of nifs and drivers to the
	      main Erlang VM binary. At the moment only the asn1 and crypto
	      nifs of the Erlang/OTP nifs and drivers have been prepared to
	      be statically linked. For more details see the Installation
	      Guide in the System documentation.

   OTP-11573  Code generation for the per and uper backends has been
	      somewhat improved.

   OTP-11594  The OCTET STRING and BIT STRING types now have a more natural
	      mapping to Erlang types (binary and bitstring, respectively),
	      which is more efficient and will avoid useless conversions
	      between lists and binaries/bitstrings.

	      This is an incompatible change. To revert to the old mapping
	      to support existing applications, use the legacy_erlang_types
	      option.

	      Impact: There is a potential for better performance, as it is
	      now possible to avoid conversions between lists and binaries
	      both in the generated ASN.1 encode/decode code and in the
	      application itself.

   OTP-11700  Subtyping an extensible ENUMERATED would cause an compilation
	      error. (Thanks to Morten Nygaard Åsnes for reporting this
	      bug.)

   OTP-11727  When specifying the value for an OCTET STRING in a
	      specification, the ASN.1 standard clearly states that the
	      value must be either a bstring or an hstring, but NOT a
	      cstring. The ASN.1 compiler will now generate a compilation
	      error if the value of an OCTET STRING is given as a character
	      string.

	      That is, the following example is now illegal:

	      string OCTET STRING ::= "Now illegal"

   OTP-11731  All functions in the asn1rt module, as well as
	      asn1ct:decode/3 and asn1ct:encode/3, are now deprecated.

   OTP-11744  Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
	      following applications: 

	      asn1, common_test, compiler, crypto, debugger, dialyzer,
	      edoc, eldap, erl_docgen, et, eunit, gs, hipe, inets,
	      observer, odbc, os_mon, otp_mibs, parsetools, percept,
	      public_key, reltool, runtime_tools, ssh, syntax_tools,
	      test_server, tools, typer, webtool, wx, xmerl

	      A new test utility for testing appup files is added to
	      test_server. This is now used by most applications in OTP.

	      (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

   OTP-11804  Generated .hrl files are now protected from being included
	      more than once.

--- common_test-1.8 -----------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11440  ct_telnet can now log all communication taking place during a
	      telnet session. Previously, only information about ct_telnet
	      operations and commands, as well as explicitly requested data
	      from the server, was logged.

	      Furthermore, a logging mechanism based on an Error Logger
	      event handler and a dedicated Common Test hook, cth_conn_log,
	      now makes it possible to print data for individual
	      connections to separate log files. Please see the ct_telnet
	      reference manual for more information and examples.

	      Important note: A new argument, ConnName has been added to
	      the unix_telnet:connect/5 callback function. This forces
	      users that use private ct_telnet callback modules to update
	      their code according to unix_telnet:connect/6. Please see the
	      unix_telnet reference manual and source code module for
	      details.

   OTP-11643  The error generated if a test case process received an exit
	      from a linked process while executing init_per_testcase/2,
	      was handled incorrectly by Common Test. The problem has been
	      solved, and Common Test now reports this type of error
	      correctly, with proper error reason and exit location as
	      well.

   OTP-11644  Running a parallel test case group with two or more instances
	      of the same test case would result in identical log file
	      names, and one test case instance would overwrite the log
	      file of another. This problem has been solved.

   OTP-11689  A new timeout option has been introduced for the
	      ct_telnet:expect/3 function. With {total_timeout,Time} it's
	      possible to set a time limit for the complete expect
	      operation. After Time milliseconds, expect/3 returns
	      {error,timeout}. The default value used if total_timeout is
	      not specified, is infinity (i.e. no time limit). Please see
	      the ct_telnet reference manual for more information.

   OTP-11702  Some function specs are corrected or moved and some edoc
	      comments are corrected in order to allow use of edoc. (Thanks
	      to Pierre Fenoll)

   OTP-11732  Test case group name information has been added to the data
	      sent with tc_user_skip and tc_auto_skip event messages, as
	      well as the data passed in calls to the CT Hook functions
	      on_tc_skip/3 and on_tc_fail/3. The modification only affects
	      the function name element/argument. This value remains an
	      atom if the test case in question does not belong to a test
	      case group. Otherwise a tuple {FuncName,GroupName}
	      ({atom(),atom()}) is passed instead.

	      Note that this change may (depending on the patterns used for
	      matching) require modifications of user event handlers and
	      hook modules. Please see the Event Handling chapter in the
	      Common Test User's Guide, and the reference manual for
	      ct_hooks, for details.

	      Note also that the Test Server framework callback function
	      report/2 has been modified. This change only affects users
	      with test frameworks interfacing Test Server rather than
	      Common Test. See the test_server_ctrl reference manual for
	      details.

   OTP-11744  Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
	      following applications: 

	      asn1, common_test, compiler, crypto, debugger, dialyzer,
	      edoc, eldap, erl_docgen, et, eunit, gs, hipe, inets,
	      observer, odbc, os_mon, otp_mibs, parsetools, percept,
	      public_key, reltool, runtime_tools, ssh, syntax_tools,
	      test_server, tools, typer, webtool, wx, xmerl

	      A new test utility for testing appup files is added to
	      test_server. This is now used by most applications in OTP.

	      (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

   OTP-11769  If Common Test can't prompt the user to abort or continue the
	      test run when one or more test suites fail to compile, a new
	      option, {abort_if_missing_suites,Bool}, can be used to
	      specify whether it should proceed with the test run, or stop
	      execution. The default value of Bool is false (i.e. to
	      proceed even if suites are missing).

   OTP-11811  The cth_surefire hook would crash in pre_init_per_suite/3 if
	      a previous hook returned {skip,Reason} or {fail,Reason}
	      instead of a Config list. This error has been corrected, and
	      cth_surefire will now simply propagate the received InitData
	      value instead.

   OTP-11834  Specs of return values are corrected for ct_netconfc:get/2,3,
	      ct_netconfc:get_config/3,4, ct_netconfc:action/2,3,
	      ct_netconfc:send_rpc/2,3 and ct_netconfc:send/2,3.

--- compiler-5.0 --------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-10652  Compilation times for modules with a huge number for record
	      accesses using the dot operator has been improved.

   OTP-11056  The compiler can generate somewhat better code by moving let
	      expressions into sequences. (Thanks to Anthony Ramine.)

   OTP-11186  Forbid unsized fields in patterns of binary generators and
	      simplified v3_core's translation of bit string generators.
	      (Thanks to Anthony Ramine.)

   OTP-11537  Funs can now be a given a name. Thanks to to Richard O'Keefe
	      for the idea (EEP37) and to Anthony Ramine for the
	      implementation.

   OTP-11544  Using the from_asm option to produce a BEAM file starting
	      from BEAM assembly code would often fail because early
	      optimization passes would not understand instructions that
	      later optimization passes would introduce. (Thanks to Anthony
	      Ramine.)

   OTP-11547  The .core and .S extensions are now documented in the erlc
	      documentation, and the 'from_core' and 'from_asm' options are
	      now documented in the compiler documentation. (Thanks to
	      Tuncer Ayaz.)

   OTP-11572  Line numbers would not be correct when a binary construction
	      such as '&lt;&lt;Bin/binary,...>>' fails. (Thanks to Stanislav
	      Seletskiy for reporting this bug.)

   OTP-11580  The compiler now properly annotates the code in value in the
	      'after' clause for a 'try' so that Dialyzer no longer
	      generates a false warning for an unmatched return.

   OTP-11584  Optimization of case expressions that build tuples or lists
	      have been improved.

   OTP-11610  Some case statements where no clause would match could cause
	      an internal error in the compiler. (Thanks to Erik Soe
	      Sorensen for reporting this bug.)

   OTP-11616  EEP43: New data type - Maps

	      With Maps you may for instance:

	      -- M0 = #{ a => 1, b => 2}, % create associations

	      -- M1 = M0#{ a := 10 }, % update values

	      -- M2 = M1#{ "hi" => "hello"}, % add new associations

	      -- #{ "hi" := V1, a := V2, b := V3} = M2. % match keys with
	      values

	      For information on how to use Maps please see the Reference
	      Manual.

	      The current implementation is without the following features:

	      -- No variable keys

	      -- No single value access

	      -- No map comprehensions

	      Note that Maps is experimental during OTP 17.0.

   OTP-11626  With --Wunmatched_returns, dialyzer will no longer warn when
	      the value of a list comprehension is ignored, provided that
	      the each value in the list would be an atomic value (such as
	      integer or atoms, as opposed to tuples and lists). Example:
	      ignoring '[io:format(...) || ...]' will not cause a warning,
	      while ignoring '[file:close(Fd) || ...]' will.

   OTP-11672  Matching out a binary and applying the binary as if it were a
	      fun would crash the run-time system. (Thanks to Loïc
	      Hoguin.)

   OTP-11678  Some local implementations of removing the last element from
	      a list are replaced by lists:droplast/1. Note that this
	      requires at least stdlib-2.0, which is the stdlib version
	      delivered in OTP 17.0. (Thanks to Hans Svensson)

   OTP-11682  Allow all auto imports to be suppressed at once. Introducing
	      the no_auto_import attribute: -compile(no_auto_import).
	      Useful for code generation tools that always use the
	      qualified function names and want to avoid the auto imported
	      functions clashing with local ones. (Thanks to José Valim.)

   OTP-11702  Some function specs are corrected or moved and some edoc
	      comments are corrected in order to allow use of edoc. (Thanks
	      to Pierre Fenoll)

   OTP-11720  Thanks to Anthony Ramine for several improvements to the
	      optimizations in the BEAM compiler and for cleaning up the
	      code the code that transforms list and binary comprehensions
	      to Core Erlang.

   OTP-11744  Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
	      following applications: 

	      asn1, common_test, compiler, crypto, debugger, dialyzer,
	      edoc, eldap, erl_docgen, et, eunit, gs, hipe, inets,
	      observer, odbc, os_mon, otp_mibs, parsetools, percept,
	      public_key, reltool, runtime_tools, ssh, syntax_tools,
	      test_server, tools, typer, webtool, wx, xmerl

	      A new test utility for testing appup files is added to
	      test_server. This is now used by most applications in OTP.

	      (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

   OTP-11751  Adapt 'asm' deprecation message to new version scheme.
	      (Thanks to Tuncer Ayaz)

   OTP-11770  A number of compiler errors where unusual or nonsensical code
	      would crash the compiler have been reported by Ulf Norell and
	      corrected by Anthony Ramine.

   OTP-11791  The default encoding for Erlang source files is now UTF-8. As
	      a temporary measure to ease the transition from the old
	      default of latin-1, if the compiler encounters byte sequences
	      that are not valid UTF-8 sequences, the compiler will re-try
	      the compilation in latin-1 mode. This workaround will be
	      removed in a future release.

--- crypto-3.3 ----------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11258  By giving --enable-static-{nifs,drivers} to configure it is
	      now possible to statically linking of nifs and drivers to the
	      main Erlang VM binary. At the moment only the asn1 and crypto
	      nifs of the Erlang/OTP nifs and drivers have been prepared to
	      be statically linked. For more details see the Installation
	      Guide in the System documentation.

   OTP-11522  Add IGE mode for AES cipher in crypto (Thanks to Yura
	      Beznos).

   OTP-11550  Fix memory leaks and invalid deallocations in mod_pow,
	      mod_exp and generate_key(srp,...) when bad arguments are
	      passed. (Thanks to Florian Zumbiehi)

   OTP-11578  Moved elliptic curve definition from the crypto NIF/OpenSSL
	      into Erlang code, adds the RFC-5639 brainpool curves and
	      makes TLS use them (RFC-7027).

	      Thanks to Andreas Schultz

   OTP-11609  Correction of the word 'ChipherText' throughout the
	      documentation (Thanks to Andrew Tunnell-Jones)

   OTP-11619  Remove all obsolete application processes from crypto and
	      make it into a pure library application.

   OTP-11724  Fix fatal bug when using a hmac context variable in more than
	      one call to hmac_update or hmac_final. The reuse of hmac
	      contexts has never worked as the underlying OpenSSL
	      implementation does not support it. It is now documented as
	      having undefined behaviour, but it does not crash or corrupt
	      the VM anymore.

   OTP-11725  Crypto handles out-of-memory with a controlled abort instead
	      of crash/corruption. (Thanks to Florian Zumbiehi)

   OTP-11744  Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
	      following applications: 

	      asn1, common_test, compiler, crypto, debugger, dialyzer,
	      edoc, eldap, erl_docgen, et, eunit, gs, hipe, inets,
	      observer, odbc, os_mon, otp_mibs, parsetools, percept,
	      public_key, reltool, runtime_tools, ssh, syntax_tools,
	      test_server, tools, typer, webtool, wx, xmerl

	      A new test utility for testing appup files is added to
	      test_server. This is now used by most applications in OTP.

	      (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

--- debugger-4.0 --------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-10915  Removed gs based applications and gs based backends. The
	      observer application replaces the removed applications.

   OTP-11553  The debugger now correctly evaluates code such as 'X = true
	      andalso X'. (Thanks to Anthony Ramine.)

   OTP-11673  Support Maps syntax in debugger (Thanks to Anthony Ramine).

   OTP-11676  A few subtle bugs in the evaluation of code in the debugger
	      has been corrected. (Thanks to Anthony Ramine.)

   OTP-11744  Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
	      following applications: 

	      asn1, common_test, compiler, crypto, debugger, dialyzer,
	      edoc, eldap, erl_docgen, et, eunit, gs, hipe, inets,
	      observer, odbc, os_mon, otp_mibs, parsetools, percept,
	      public_key, reltool, runtime_tools, ssh, syntax_tools,
	      test_server, tools, typer, webtool, wx, xmerl

	      A new test utility for testing appup files is added to
	      test_server. This is now used by most applications in OTP.

	      (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

--- dialyzer-2.7 --------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-10342  The pre-defined types array/0, dict/0, digraph/0, gb_set/0,
	      gb_tree/0, queue/0, set/0, and tid/0 have been deprecated.
	      They will be removed in Erlang/OTP 18.0.

	      Instead the types array:array/0, dict:dict/0,
	      digraph:graph/0, gb_set:set/0, gb_tree:tree/0, queue:queue/0,
	      sets:set/0, and ets:tid/0 can be used. (Note: it has always
	      been necessary to use ets:tid/0.)

	      It is allowed in Erlang/OTP 17.0 to locally re-define the
	      types array/0, dict/0, and so on.

	      New types array:array/1, dict:dict/2, gb_sets:set/1,
	      gb_trees:tree/2, queue:queue/1, and sets:set/1 have been
	      added.

	      A compiler option, nowarn_deprecated_type, has been
	      introduced. By including the attribute

	      -compile(nowarn_deprecated_type).

	      in an Erlang source file, warnings about deprecated types can
	      be avoided in Erlang/OTP 17.0.

	      The option can also be given as a compiler flag:

	      erlc +nowarn_deprecated_type file.erl

   OTP-10397  Dialyzer will no longer emit warnings when inspecting or
	      modifying opaque types within the scope of a module.

	      Hitherto the shape of terms (tuple, list, etc.) has been used
	      to determine the opaque terms, but now the contracts are used
	      for decorating types with opaqueness.

   OTP-10915  Removed gs based applications and gs based backends. The
	      observer application replaces the removed applications.

   OTP-11186  Forbid unsized fields in patterns of binary generators and
	      simplified v3_core's translation of bit string generators.
	      (Thanks to Anthony Ramine.)

   OTP-11616  EEP43: New data type - Maps

	      With Maps you may for instance:

	      -- M0 = #{ a => 1, b => 2}, % create associations

	      -- M1 = M0#{ a := 10 }, % update values

	      -- M2 = M1#{ "hi" => "hello"}, % add new associations

	      -- #{ "hi" := V1, a := V2, b := V3} = M2. % match keys with
	      values

	      For information on how to use Maps please see the Reference
	      Manual.

	      The current implementation is without the following features:

	      -- No variable keys

	      -- No single value access

	      -- No map comprehensions

	      Note that Maps is experimental during OTP 17.0.

   OTP-11625  Parameterized opaque types have been introduced.

   OTP-11626  With --Wunmatched_returns, dialyzer will no longer warn when
	      the value of a list comprehension is ignored, provided that
	      the each value in the list would be an atomic value (such as
	      integer or atoms, as opposed to tuples and lists). Example:
	      ignoring '[io:format(...) || ...]' will not cause a warning,
	      while ignoring '[file:close(Fd) || ...]' will.

   OTP-11702  Some function specs are corrected or moved and some edoc
	      comments are corrected in order to allow use of edoc. (Thanks
	      to Pierre Fenoll)

   OTP-11706  The man page for dialyzer now contains correct information
	      regarding -Wno_behaviours. (Thanks to Steve Vinosky.)

   OTP-11743  Fix handling of 'on_load' attribute. (Thanks to Kostis
	      Sagonas.)

   OTP-11744  Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
	      following applications: 

	      asn1, common_test, compiler, crypto, debugger, dialyzer,
	      edoc, eldap, erl_docgen, et, eunit, gs, hipe, inets,
	      observer, odbc, os_mon, otp_mibs, parsetools, percept,
	      public_key, reltool, runtime_tools, ssh, syntax_tools,
	      test_server, tools, typer, webtool, wx, xmerl

	      A new test utility for testing appup files is added to
	      test_server. This is now used by most applications in OTP.

	      (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

   OTP-11798  The generalization of guard constraints has been modified.

   OTP-11826  Dialyzer now plays nicely with funs that come as "external"
	      arguments. (Thanks to Stavros Aronis for fixing the bug.)

--- diameter-1.6 --------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11561  Add missing check at dictionary compilation.

	      In particular, that an AVP defined as having type Grouped in
	      an @avp_types section has a corresponding definition in a
	      @grouped section.

   OTP-11583  Correct documentation on the setting of Origin-State-Id

	      It was incorrectly stated that the AVP would be set in an
	      outgoing DPR/DPA.

   OTP-11593  Change interface for communicating outbound stream id to
	      diameter_sctp

	      The module uses the transport_data field of record
	      diameter_packet to communicate the stream on which the an
	      incoming message is received and on which an outgoing message
	      should be sent, the previous interface being that both are
	      communicated as a tuple of the form {stream, Id}. However,
	      since diameter retains the value of an incoming request's
	      transport_data unless the corresponding answer message
	      specifies otherwise, the behaviour in this case is to send an
	      answer on the outbound stream with the same identifier as the
	      that of the inbound stream on which the request was received.
	      If the inbound stream id is greater than or equal to the
	      number of outbound streams then this is guaranteed to fail,
	      causing the transport process in question to terminate. There
	      is no relationship between inbound and outbound stream
	      identifiers so diameter_sctp's imposition of one is simply
	      wrong.

	      Outbound stream ids are now communicated with a different
	      tuple: {outstream, Id}, interpreted modulo the number of
	      outbound streams. Thus, retention of an inbound request's
	      transport_data has no effect on the selection of an outbound
	      stream.

	      The change in interface is not strictly backwards compatible
	      because of the new atom for the outbound stream. However, as
	      there is currently no documented way of obtaining the
	      available number of outbound streams for a peer connection,
	      there is no way for a client to have known the range of ids
	      from which it could reliably have chosen with the previous
	      interface, so any setting of the outbound stream has probably
	      been unintentional. Not explicitly specifying an outbound
	      stream now results in a round-robin selection.

	      Thanks to Sharmila Pillai for reporting the problem.

   OTP-11655  Fix unicode path failure in diameter_make:codec/2.

	      A dictionary path containing a unicode codepoint > 255 caused
	      the function to fail.

   OTP-11661  Fix 'accept' config to diameter_sctp.

	      OTP-10893 added support for {accept, Match} tuples to specify
	      addresses or regexps that should be matched against peer
	      addresses to decide whether or not a newly established
	      association should be retained, but this hasn't been
	      functional in the SCTP case because of missing support in
	      inet(3).

	      The display of both local and peer addresses in
	      diameter:service_info/2 output has also been corrected.

   OTP-11675  Be lenient with the M-bit in Grouped AVPs.

	      RFC 6733 says this, in 4.4:

	      -- 

	      Receivers of a Grouped AVP that does not have the 'M'
	      (mandatory) bit set and one or more of the encapsulated AVPs
	      within the group has the 'M' (mandatory) bit set MAY simply
	      be ignored if the Grouped AVP itself is unrecognized. The
	      rule applies even if the encapsulated AVP with its 'M'
	      (mandatory) bit set is further encapsulated within other
	      sub-groups, i.e., other Grouped AVPs embedded within the
	      Grouped AVP.

	      The first sentence is mangled but take it to mean this:

	      -- 

	      An unrecognized AVP of type Grouped that does not set the 'M'
	      bit MAY be ignored even if one of its encapsulated AVPs sets
	      the 'M' bit.

	      This is a bit of a non-statement since if the AVP is
	      unrecognized then its type is unknown. We therefore don't
	      know that its data bytes contain encapsulated AVPs, so can't
	      but ignore any of those that set the M-bit. Doing anything
	      else when the type *is* known would be inconsistent.

	      OTP-11087 (R16B03) caused the M-bit on any unrecognized AVP
	      to be regarded as an error, unrecognized being taken to mean
	      "not explicitly defined as a member of its container". (That
	      is, an AVP that can't be packed into a dedicated record
	      field, which is slightly stronger than "not defined".) This
	      fixed the original intention for top-level AVPs but broke the
	      required leniency for Grouped AVPs whose type is known. This
	      leniency is now restored.

	      Note that dictionary files need to be recompiled for the
	      change to have effect.

	      Thanks to Rory McKeown for reporting the problem.

   OTP-11789  Fix pick_peer case clause failure.

	      In the case of {call_mutates_state, true} configuration on
	      the service in question, any peer selection that failed to
	      select a peer resulted in a case clause failure. This was
	      noticed in the case of a peer failover in which an alternate
	      peer wasn't available.

--- edoc-0.7.13 ---------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11744  Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
	      following applications: 

	      asn1, common_test, compiler, crypto, debugger, dialyzer,
	      edoc, eldap, erl_docgen, et, eunit, gs, hipe, inets,
	      observer, odbc, os_mon, otp_mibs, parsetools, percept,
	      public_key, reltool, runtime_tools, ssh, syntax_tools,
	      test_server, tools, typer, webtool, wx, xmerl

	      A new test utility for testing appup files is added to
	      test_server. This is now used by most applications in OTP.

	      (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

--- eldap-1.0.3 ---------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11744  Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
	      following applications: 

	      asn1, common_test, compiler, crypto, debugger, dialyzer,
	      edoc, eldap, erl_docgen, et, eunit, gs, hipe, inets,
	      observer, odbc, os_mon, otp_mibs, parsetools, percept,
	      public_key, reltool, runtime_tools, ssh, syntax_tools,
	      test_server, tools, typer, webtool, wx, xmerl

	      A new test utility for testing appup files is added to
	      test_server. This is now used by most applications in OTP.

	      (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

   OTP-11753  Add support for IPv6 connections, By including the [inet6]
	      option in eldap:open/2. Default value is still [inet] (Thanks
	      to Edwin Fine)

   OTP-11768  Fixed bug where eldap:search returned binaries instead of
	      strings. (Thanks Simon MacMullen for the report)

--- erl_docgen-0.3.5 ----------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11744  Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
	      following applications: 

	      asn1, common_test, compiler, crypto, debugger, dialyzer,
	      edoc, eldap, erl_docgen, et, eunit, gs, hipe, inets,
	      observer, odbc, os_mon, otp_mibs, parsetools, percept,
	      public_key, reltool, runtime_tools, ssh, syntax_tools,
	      test_server, tools, typer, webtool, wx, xmerl

	      A new test utility for testing appup files is added to
	      test_server. This is now used by most applications in OTP.

	      (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

   OTP-11776  Handle map types in docgen_edoc_xml_cb

--- erl_interface-3.7.16 ------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11608  Fix memcheck warning in gen_challange (Thanks to Olivier
	      Girondel)

--- erts-6.0 ------------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-10285  Options to set match_limit and match_limit_recursion are
	      added to re:run. The option report_errors is also added to
	      get more information when re:run fails due to limits or
	      compilation errors.

   OTP-10908  Dialyzer's unmatched_return warnings have been corrected.

   OTP-11082  A common case is to wrap an argument to list_to_binary/1 in a
	      list to ensure conversion can happen even though the argument
	      may already be a binary. Take special care of this case and
	      do not copy binary.

	      Impact: May cause incompatibility since a single binary is no
	      longer copied. Use binary:copy/1,2 instead.

   OTP-11105  Make erlang:open_port/2 spawn and spawn_executable handle
	      unicode.

   OTP-11135  Handle unicode (widestring) in erl, erlc, heart, etc on
	      windows.

   OTP-11204  The version of the PCRE library Used by Erlang's re module is
	      raised to 8.33 from 7.6. This means, among other things,
	      better Unicode and Unicode Character Properties support. New
	      options connected to PCRE 8.33 are also added to the re
	      module (ucd, notempty_atstart, no_start_optimize). PCRE has
	      extended the regular expression syntax between 7.6 and 8.33,
	      why this imposes a potential incompatibility. Only very
	      complicated regular expressions may be affected, but if you
	      know you are using obscure features, please test run your
	      regular expressions and verify that their behavior has not
	      changed.

   OTP-11205  The option dupnames did not work as intended in re. When
	      looking for names with {capture, [Name, ...]}, re:run
	      returned a random instance of the match for that name,
	      instead of the leftmost matching instance, which was what the
	      documentation stated. This is now corrected to adhere to the
	      documentation. The option {capture,all_names} along with a
	      re:inspect/2 function is also added to further help in using
	      named subpatterns.

   OTP-11248  Filenames containing UTF-8 encoded characters can now be
	      handled by erlc.

	      If you have set the ERLC_EMULATOR environment variable, note
	      that erlc in OTP 17 will only work with erl in OTP 17 since
	      the protocol between the erlc program and the erl_compile
	      module has changed.

   OTP-11258  By giving --enable-static-{nifs,drivers} to configure it is
	      now possible to statically linking of nifs and drivers to the
	      main Erlang VM binary. At the moment only the asn1 and crypto
	      nifs of the Erlang/OTP nifs and drivers have been prepared to
	      be statically linked. For more details see the Installation
	      Guide in the System documentation.

   OTP-11334  Erlang/OTP has been ported to the realtime operating system
	      OSE. The port supports both smp and non-smp emulator. For
	      details around the port and how to started see the User's
	      Guide in the ose application. 

	      Note that not all parts of Erlang/OTP has been ported. 

	      Notable things that work are: non-smp and smp emulators, OSE
	      signal interaction, crypto, asn1, run_erl/to_erl, tcp, epmd,
	      distribution and most if not all non-os specific
	      functionality of Erlang.

	      Notable things that does not work are: udp/sctp, os_mon,
	      erl_interface, binding of schedulers.

   OTP-11368  Add the {active,N} socket option for TCP, UDP, and SCTP,
	      where N is an integer in the range -32768..32767, to allow a
	      caller to specify the number of data messages to be delivered
	      to the controlling process. Once the socket's delivered
	      message count either reaches 0 or is explicitly set to 0 with
	      inet:setopts/2 or by including {active,0} as an option when
	      the socket is created, the socket transitions to passive
	      ({active, false}) mode and the socket's controlling process
	      receives a message to inform it of the transition. TCP
	      sockets receive {tcp_passive,Socket}, UDP sockets receive
	      {udp_passive,Socket} and SCTP sockets receive
	      {sctp_passive,Socket}. 

	      The socket's delivered message counter defaults to 0, but it
	      can be set using {active,N} via any gen_tcp, gen_udp, or
	      gen_sctp function that takes socket options as arguments, or
	      via inet:setopts/2. New N values are added to the socket's
	      current counter value, and negative numbers can be used to
	      reduce the counter value. Specifying a number that would
	      cause the socket's counter value to go above 32767 causes an
	      einval error. If a negative number is specified such that the
	      counter value would become negative, the socket's counter
	      value is set to 0 and the socket transitions to passive mode.
	      If the counter value is already 0 and inet:setopts(Socket,
	      [{active,0}]) is specified, the counter value remains at 0
	      but the appropriate passive mode transition message is
	      generated for the socket.

	      Thanks to Steve Vinoski

   OTP-11385  A new optional scheduler utilization balancing mechanism has
	      been introduced. For more information see the +sub command
	      line argument.

	      Characteristics impact: None, when not enabled. When enabled,
	      changed timing in the system, normally a small overhead due
	      to measuring of utilization and calculating balancing
	      information. On some systems, such as old Windows systems,
	      the overhead can be quite substantial. This time measurement
	      overhead highly depend on the underlying primitives provided
	      by the OS.

   OTP-11388  A call to either the garbage_collect/1 BIF or the
	      check_process_code/2 BIF may trigger garbage collection of
	      another processes than the process calling the BIF. The
	      previous implementations performed these kinds of garbage
	      collections without considering the internal state of the
	      process being garbage collected. In order to be able to more
	      easily and more efficiently implement yielding native code,
	      these types of garbage collections have been rewritten. A
	      garbage collection like this is now triggered by an
	      asynchronous request signal, the actual garbage collection is
	      performed by the process being garbage collected itself, and
	      finalized by a reply signal to the process issuing the
	      request. Using this approach processes can disable garbage
	      collection and yield without having to set up the heap in a
	      state that can be garbage collected.

	      The garbage_collect/2, and check_process_code/3 BIFs have
	      been introduced. Both taking an option list as last argument.
	      Using these, one can issue asynchronous requests.

	      code:purge/1 and code:soft_purge/1 have been rewritten to
	      utilize asynchronous check_process_code requests in order to
	      parallelize work.

	      Characteristics impact: A call to the garbage_collect/1 BIF
	      or the check_process_code/2 BIF will normally take longer
	      time to complete while the system as a whole wont be as much
	      negatively effected by the operation as before. A call to
	      code:purge/1 and code:soft_purge/1 may complete faster or
	      slower depending on the state of the system while the system
	      as a whole wont be as much negatively effected by the
	      operation as before.

   OTP-11408  Allow loading of NIF library with unicode path name

   OTP-11419  Cleanup 'Buckets' and 'Time left' fields in crashdump to ease
	      parsing.

   OTP-11498  Add sync option to file:open/2.

	      The sync option adds the POSIX O_SYNC flag to the open system
	      call on platforms that support the flag or its equivalent,
	      e.g., FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH on Windows. For platforms that
	      don't support it, file:open/2 returns {error, enotsup} if the
	      sync option is passed in. Thank to Steve Vinoski and Joseph
	      Blomstedt

   OTP-11535  erlang:binary_to_term will now cost an appropriate amount of
	      reductions and will interrupt (yield) for reschedule if the
	      term is big. This avoids too long schedules when
	      binary_to_term is used. (Thanks to Svante Karlsson for the
	      original patch)

	      Impact: Programs running binary_to_term on large binaries
	      will run more smoothly, but rescheduling will impact the
	      single process performance of the BIF. Single threaded
	      benchmarks might show degraded performance of the BIF, while
	      general system behaviour will be improved.

   OTP-11549  Allow loading of driver with unicode path name

   OTP-11558  Fixed a bug where starting Erlang without having an open
	      stdin on fd 0 would sometimes deadlock the emulator when
	      terminating.

   OTP-11560  Added high resolution icon for windows. (Thanks to Daniel
	      Goertz for the inspiration.)

   OTP-11565  The option '-names' in epmd now works on Windows (Thanks to
	      Johannes Weißl)

   OTP-11577  Correction of the examples in escript documentation. (Thanks
	      to Pierre Fenoll).

   OTP-11581  Fix bs_get_integer instruction

	      The instruction bs_get_integer could unnecessarily trigger a
	      garbage collection in failure cases which is unwanted or
	      outright dangerous.

	      Ex:

	      &lt;&lt;X:Sz,_/bits>> = &lt;&lt;"some binary">>

	      Previously, if Sz induced X to a bignum it would reserved
	      memory size this on the heap via a garbage collection before
	      checking if the size could actually match.

	      It will now check the binary size before triggering a
	      collection.

   OTP-11585  Remove heap space overestimation in binary_to_term (and
	      remote message reception) for integers in the intervals
	      [-2147483648,-1] and [256,2147483647] on 64-bit emulators.

   OTP-11590  Add support for detecting the separate tinfo library from
	      ncurses (Thanks to Dirkjan Ochtman)

   OTP-11602  Deprecation warning for system_flag(cpu_topology) has been
	      extended for removal in OTP 18 (Thanks to Steve Vinoski for
	      the update)

   OTP-11604  Migration of memory carriers has been enabled by default on
	      all ERTS internal memory allocators based on the alloc_util
	      framework except for temp_alloc. That is, +M&lt;S>acul de is
	      default for these allocators. Note that this also implies
	      changed allocation strategies for all of these allocators.
	      They will all now use the "address order first fit carrier
	      best fit" strategy.

	      By passing +Muacul 0 on the command line, all configuration
	      changes made by this change will be reverted.

	      Characteristics impact: Improved memory characteristics with
	      a smaller memory footprint at the expense of a quite small
	      performance cost.

   OTP-11607  Documentation improvement regarding some awkward wording
	      around the +spp flag. (Thanks to Brian L. Troutwine )

   OTP-11611  A clarification has been added to the documentation of
	      -on_load() in the Reference Manual that it is only
	      recommended for loading NIF libraries.

   OTP-11612  +fnaw is now default when starting the emulator; it used to
	      be +fnl.

   OTP-11614  Fixed bug where sendfile would return the wrong error code
	      for a remotely closed socket if the socket was in passive
	      mode. (Thanks to Vincent Siliakus for reporting the bug.)

   OTP-11616  EEP43: New data type - Maps

	      With Maps you may for instance:

	      -- M0 = #{ a => 1, b => 2}, % create associations

	      -- M1 = M0#{ a := 10 }, % update values

	      -- M2 = M1#{ "hi" => "hello"}, % add new associations

	      -- #{ "hi" := V1, a := V2, b := V3} = M2. % match keys with
	      values

	      For information on how to use Maps please see the Reference
	      Manual.

	      The current implementation is without the following features:

	      -- No variable keys

	      -- No single value access

	      -- No map comprehensions

	      Note that Maps is experimental during OTP 17.0.

   OTP-11617  Increase garbage collection tenure rate

	      The garbage collector tries to maintain the previous heap
	      block size during a minor gc, i.e. 'need' is not utilized in
	      determining the size of the new heap, instead it relies on
	      tenure and garbage to be sufficiently large.

	      In instances during intense growing with exclusively live
	      data on the heap coupled with delayed tenure, fullsweeps
	      would be triggered directly after a minor gc to make room for
	      'need' since the new heap would be full.

	      To remedy this, the tenure of terms on the minor heap will
	      always happen (if it is below the high watermark) instead of
	      every other minor gc.

	      Characteristics Impact: Reduced CPU-time spent in garbage
	      collection but may infer delays in collecting garbage from
	      the heap. Tweak 'fullsweep_after' options to increase gc
	      pressure if needed.

   OTP-11618  Fix bug when comparing integers with floats larger than
	      2^992. The bug could potentially cause memory corruption on
	      32-bit emulators.

   OTP-11628  The previously deprecated driver API function
	      driver_async_cancel() has been removed. Due to this, the
	      driver API version has been bumped to 3.0.

	      Thanks to Steve Vinoski.

   OTP-11629  Experimental "dirty scheduler" functionality has been
	      introduced. In order to try the functionality out, you need
	      to pass the command line argument --enable-dirty-schedulers
	      to configure when building the system.

	      Dirty schedulers can currently only be used by NIFs on a
	      system with SMP support. More information can be found in the
	      erl_nif(3) documentation, the erl(1) documentation, and in
	      the git commit comment of commit
	      'c1c03ae4ee50e58b7669ea88ec4d29c6b2b67c7b'.

	      Note that the functionality is experimental, and not
	      supported. This functionality will be subject to backward
	      incompatible changes. You should not enable the dirty
	      scheduler functionality on production systems. It is only
	      provided for testing.

	      Thanks to Steve Vinoski.

   OTP-11635  Cross-compilation fixes for TileraMDE-3.0.1.125620

   OTP-11639  sendfile no longer uses async threads by default

	      This has been done because a slow client attack is possible
	      if the async thread pool is used. The scenario is:

	      Client does a request for a file and then slowly receives the
	      file one byte at a time. This will eventually fill the async
	      thread pool with blocking sendfile operations and thus
	      starving the vm of all file operations.

	      If you still want to use the async threads pool for sendfile
	      an option to enable it has been introduced.

	      Thanks to Christopher Faulet for identifying this
	      vulnerability.

   OTP-11648  Improve reduction cost and yielding of term_to_binary. The
	      reduction cost is increased and garbage collection is
	      disabled during yield.

	      Impact: Improves system responsiveness when term_to_binary is
	      called with large terms without significant degradation of
	      single threaded performance.

   OTP-11669  By default, the system's version of zlib will be used,
	      provided its version is 1.2.4 or higher; otherwise the
	      built-in zlib will be used. The built-in version of zlib has
	      been bumped to 1.2.8. (Use the --enable-builtin-zlib option
	      to configure to force the use of the built-in zlib.)

   OTP-11722  Do proper rollback of calls to enif_open_resource_type when
	      load/upgrade callbacks of NIF library return failure.

   OTP-11723  Changed the default configuration when configuring with
	      $ERL_TOP/configure to be the same as when configuring with
	      $ERL_TOP/otp_build configure.

	      Previously floating point exceptions got enabled by default
	      on Linux when HiPE was enabled when configuring with
	      $ERL_TOP/configure, but not when configuring with
	      $ERL_TOP/otp_build configure. The default is now in both
	      cases not to use floating point exceptions since there still
	      exist unresolved issues with floating point exceptions on
	      Linux.

	      For more information see $ERL_TOP/HOWTO/INSTALL.md.

   OTP-11738  The default float encoding in binary_to_term and
	      external_size has been changed to use minor_mode 1 instead of
	      0.

   OTP-11742  Introduced the configure option
	      --with-assumed-cache-line-size=SIZE. For more information see
	      $ERL_TOP/HOWTO/INSTALL.md.

   OTP-11777  Halfword emulator is marked as deprecated. It still works as
	      before but is planned to be removed in a future major
	      release.

   OTP-11782  The external format for Maps has changed in a way that is not
	      compatible with the format used in OTP 17.0-rc1 and OTP
	      17.0-rc2.

   OTP-11784  Fixed faulty make dependency that would make some make
	      versions fail while building gen_git_version.mk.

   OTP-11793  A comment in erl_db_tree.c no longer differ from the code.
	      (Thanks to Cobus Carstens)

   OTP-11808  Fix epmd debug functionality for VxWorks (Thanks to Jay True)

   OTP-11809  Use closefrom/2 when available in child_setup (Thanks to Rick
	      Reed and Anthony Ramine)

   OTP-11813  Support file paths longer than 259 characters on Windows.
	      Long absolute paths are automatically converted to UNC format
	      with a \\?\ prefix which is the only way to represent long
	      paths. The 259 character limit still applies for individual
	      file names, relative paths and the current working directory.

   OTP-11816  Fix dtrace/systemtap bug where the probe arguments would be
	      concatenated due to faulty length calculation. 

	      Thanks to Michal Ptaszek and Scott Lystig Fritchie

   OTP-11818  It is now better documented that the +fn* flags to erl also
	      affect how command line parameters and environment variables
	      are read. (Thanks to Vlad Dumitrescu)

   OTP-11827  Document that escript:create/2 also accepts a 3-elements
	      tuple containing files and zip:create/3 options to build a
	      zip file.

	      Thanks to Pierre Fenoll

   OTP-11829  Add systemd socket activation for epmd.

	      Thanks to Matwey V. Kornilov

--- et-1.5 --------------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-10915  Removed gs based applications and gs based backends. The
	      observer application replaces the removed applications.

   OTP-11744  Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
	      following applications: 

	      asn1, common_test, compiler, crypto, debugger, dialyzer,
	      edoc, eldap, erl_docgen, et, eunit, gs, hipe, inets,
	      observer, odbc, os_mon, otp_mibs, parsetools, percept,
	      public_key, reltool, runtime_tools, ssh, syntax_tools,
	      test_server, tools, typer, webtool, wx, xmerl

	      A new test utility for testing appup files is added to
	      test_server. This is now used by most applications in OTP.

	      (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

--- eunit-2.2.7 ---------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11744  Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
	      following applications:

	      (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

--- gs-1.5.16 -----------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11744  Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
	      following applications: 

	      asn1, common_test, compiler, crypto, debugger, dialyzer,
	      edoc, eldap, erl_docgen, et, eunit, gs, hipe, inets,

	      (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

--- hipe-3.10.3 ---------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-10342  The pre-defined types array/0, dict/0, digraph/0, gb_set/0,
	      gb_tree/0, queue/0, set/0, and tid/0 have been deprecated.
	      They will be removed in Erlang/OTP 18.0.

	      Instead the types array:array/0, dict:dict/0,
	      digraph:graph/0, gb_set:set/0, gb_tree:tree/0, queue:queue/0,
	      sets:set/0, and ets:tid/0 can be used. (Note: it has always
	      been necessary to use ets:tid/0.)

	      It is allowed in Erlang/OTP 17.0 to locally re-define the
	      types array/0, dict/0, and so on.

	      New types array:array/1, dict:dict/2, gb_sets:set/1,
	      gb_trees:tree/2, queue:queue/1, and sets:set/1 have been
	      added.

	      A compiler option, nowarn_deprecated_type, has been
	      introduced. By including the attribute

	      -compile(nowarn_deprecated_type).

	      in an Erlang source file, warnings about deprecated types can
	      be avoided in Erlang/OTP 17.0.

	      The option can also be given as a compiler flag:

	      erlc +nowarn_deprecated_type file.erl

   OTP-11564  Fix compilation with 'no_remove_comments' (Thanks to Johannes
	      Weißl)

   OTP-11616  EEP43: New data type - Maps

	      With Maps you may for instance:

	      -- M0 = #{ a => 1, b => 2}, % create associations

	      -- M1 = M0#{ a := 10 }, % update values

	      -- M2 = M1#{ "hi" => "hello"}, % add new associations

	      -- #{ "hi" := V1, a := V2, b := V3} = M2. % match keys with
	      values

	      For information on how to use Maps please see the Reference
	      Manual.

	      The current implementation is without the following features:

	      -- No variable keys

	      -- No single value access

	      -- No map comprehensions

	      Note that Maps is experimental during OTP 17.0.

   OTP-11625  Parameterized opaque types have been introduced.

   OTP-11744  Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
	      following applications: 

	      asn1, common_test, compiler, crypto, debugger, dialyzer,
	      edoc, eldap, erl_docgen, et, eunit, gs, hipe, inets,

	      A new test utility for testing appup files is added to
	      test_server. This is now used by most applications in OTP.

	      (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

   OTP-11748  There is now a test suite for the Hipe application

   OTP-11801  Support for a LLVM backend has been added in HiPE

   OTP-11831  Add support for the compilation of the is_map/1 and
	      map_size/1 guards to native code.

--- ic-4.3.5 ------------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11783  Added Latin-1 code directive in the generated files to keep
	      old behaviour. Updated IC so it can handle Unicode characters
	      in the path.

--- inets-5.10 ----------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11538  Fixed a spelling mistake in httpc doc (Thanks to Wasif Riaz
	      Malik)

   OTP-11744  Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the

   OTP-11750  ftp now sanitize file name, user name and passwords from &lt;CR>
	      and &lt;LF> tags (Thanks to Sergei Golovan)

   OTP-11756  The commit 6189bc07 "inets: httpc improve pipelining" has
	      been reverted, as it turned out to break things rather than
	      improve pipelining utilization. It is instead up to the user
	      to configure httpc and use it wisely to be able to get the
	      most out of pipelining.

   OTP-11794  Corrected error handling in the HTTP client, making it behave
	      more graceful.

	      Thanks to Kirilll Zaborsky

   OTP-11802  Support identity transfer-encoding in httpc.

	      Thanks to Anthony Ramine

   OTP-11803  Ignore empty Set-Cookie headers to increase interoperability
	      with servers that violate the RFC. 

	      Thanks to Kirilll Zaborsky

   OTP-11838  Handle all response codes in httpd_util:message/3

--- jinterface-1.5.9 ----------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11703  Implement support for Maps

	      The API and implementation are simplistic, like for lists and
	      tuples, using arrays and without any connection to
	      java.util.Map. (Thanks to Vlad Dumitrescu)

--- kernel-3.0 ----------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-10843  heart:set_cmd/1 is updated to allow unicode code points > 255
	      in the given heart command

   OTP-10908  Dialyzer's unmatched_return warnings have been corrected.

   OTP-11105  Make erlang:open_port/2 spawn and spawn_executable handle
	      unicode.

   OTP-11171  Fixed a deadlock possibility in terminate application

   OTP-11334  Erlang/OTP has been ported to the realtime operating system
	      OSE. The port supports both smp and non-smp emulator. For
	      details around the port and how to started see the User's
	      Guide in the ose application. 

	      Note that not all parts of Erlang/OTP has been ported. 

	      Notable things that work are: non-smp and smp emulators, OSE
	      signal interaction, crypto, asn1, run_erl/to_erl, tcp, epmd,
	      distribution and most if not all non-os specific
	      functionality of Erlang.

	      Notable things that does not work are: udp/sctp, os_mon,
	      erl_interface, binding of schedulers.

   OTP-11368  Add the {active,N} socket option for TCP, UDP, and SCTP,
	      where N is an integer in the range -32768..32767, to allow a
	      caller to specify the number of data messages to be delivered
	      to the controlling process. Once the socket's delivered
	      message count either reaches 0 or is explicitly set to 0 with
	      inet:setopts/2 or by including {active,0} as an option when
	      the socket is created, the socket transitions to passive
	      ({active, false}) mode and the socket's controlling process
	      receives a message to inform it of the transition. TCP
	      sockets receive {tcp_passive,Socket}, UDP sockets receive
	      {udp_passive,Socket} and SCTP sockets receive
	      {sctp_passive,Socket}. 

	      The socket's delivered message counter defaults to 0, but it
	      can be set using {active,N} via any gen_tcp, gen_udp, or
	      gen_sctp function that takes socket options as arguments, or
	      via inet:setopts/2. New N values are added to the socket's
	      current counter value, and negative numbers can be used to
	      reduce the counter value. Specifying a number that would
	      cause the socket's counter value to go above 32767 causes an
	      einval error. If a negative number is specified such that the
	      counter value would become negative, the socket's counter
	      value is set to 0 and the socket transitions to passive mode.
	      If the counter value is already 0 and inet:setopts(Socket,
	      [{active,0}]) is specified, the counter value remains at 0
	      but the appropriate passive mode transition message is
	      generated for the socket.

	      Thanks to Steve Vinoski

   OTP-11388  A call to either the garbage_collect/1 BIF or the
	      check_process_code/2 BIF may trigger garbage collection of
	      another processes than the process calling the BIF. The
	      previous implementations performed these kinds of garbage
	      collections without considering the internal state of the
	      process being garbage collected. In order to be able to more
	      easily and more efficiently implement yielding native code,
	      these types of garbage collections have been rewritten. A
	      garbage collection like this is now triggered by an
	      asynchronous request signal, the actual garbage collection is
	      performed by the process being garbage collected itself, and
	      finalized by a reply signal to the process issuing the
	      request. Using this approach processes can disable garbage
	      collection and yield without having to set up the heap in a
	      state that can be garbage collected.

	      The garbage_collect/2, and check_process_code/3 BIFs have
	      been introduced. Both taking an option list as last argument.
	      Using these, one can issue asynchronous requests.

	      code:purge/1 and code:soft_purge/1 have been rewritten to
	      utilize asynchronous check_process_code requests in order to
	      parallelize work.

	      Characteristics impact: A call to the garbage_collect/1 BIF
	      or the check_process_code/2 BIF will normally take longer
	      time to complete while the system as a whole wont be as much
	      negatively effected by the operation as before. A call to
	      code:purge/1 and code:soft_purge/1 may complete faster or
	      slower depending on the state of the system while the system
	      as a whole wont be as much negatively effected by the
	      operation as before.

   OTP-11498  Add sync option to file:open/2.

	      The sync option adds the POSIX O_SYNC flag to the open system
	      call on platforms that support the flag or its equivalent,
	      e.g., FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH on Windows. For platforms that
	      don't support it, file:open/2 returns {error, enotsup} if the
	      sync option is passed in. Thank to Steve Vinoski and Joseph
	      Blomstedt

   OTP-11614  Fixed bug where sendfile would return the wrong error code
	      for a remotely closed socket if the socket was in passive
	      mode. (Thanks to Vincent Siliakus for reporting the bug.)

   OTP-11708  The new option persistent is added to application:set_env/4
	      and application:unset_env/3. An environment key set with the
	      persistent option will not be overridden by the ones
	      configured in the application resource file on load. This
	      means persistent values will stick after the application is
	      loaded and also on application reload. (Thanks to José
	      Valim)

   OTP-11730  The contract of inet:ntoa/1 has been corrected.

	      Thanks to Max Treskin.

   OTP-11787  The spec for file:set_cwd/1 is modified to also accept
	      binaries as arguments. This has always been allowed in the
	      code, but it was not reflected in the spec since binaries are
	      mostly used for raw file names. Raw file names are names that
	      are not encoded according to file:native_name_encoding(), and
	      these are not allowed in file:set_cwd/1. The spec is now,
	      however, more allowing in order to avoid unnecessary dialyzer
	      warnings. Raw file names will still fail in runtime with
	      reason 'no_translation'. (Thanks to José Valim)

--- mnesia-4.12 ---------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11497  To prevent a race condition if there is a short communication
	      problem when node-down and node-up events are received. They
	      are now stored and later checked if the node came up just
	      before mnesia flagged the node as down. (Thanks to Jonas
	      Falkevik )

   OTP-11678  Some local implementations of removing the last element from
	      a list are replaced by lists:droplast/1. Note that this
	      requires at least stdlib-2.0, which is the stdlib version
	      delivered in OTP 17.0. (Thanks to Hans Svensson)

   OTP-11729  Added mnesia:sync_log/0 to explicit sync mnesias transaction
	      log.

   OTP-11744  Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
	      following applications: 

	      asn1, common_test, compiler, crypto, debugger, dialyzer,
	      edoc, eldap, erl_docgen, et, eunit, gs, hipe, inets,
	      observer, odbc, os_mon, otp_mibs, parsetools, percept,
	      public_key, reltool, runtime_tools, ssh, syntax_tools,
	      test_server, tools, typer, webtool, wx, xmerl

	      A new test utility for testing appup files is added to
	      test_server. This is now used by most applications in OTP.

	      (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

--- observer-2.0 --------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-10915  Removed gs based applications and gs based backends. The
	      observer application replaces the removed applications.

   OTP-11179  The crashdump_viewer is re-written using wx. The old webtool
	      interface for crashdump_viewer does no longer exist.

   OTP-11633  etop trace handler now works in smp environment (Thanks to
	      Péter Gömöri)

   OTP-11744  Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the

	      observer, odbc, os_mon, otp_mibs, parsetools, percept,
	      public_key, reltool, runtime_tools, ssh, syntax_tools,
	      test_server, tools, typer, webtool, wx, xmerl

	      A new test utility for testing appup files is added to
	      test_server. This is now used by most applications in OTP.

	      (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

--- odbc-2.10.20 --------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11569  Removed warnings at compile time by adding missing include
	      file (Thanks to Anthony Ramine)

   OTP-11630  Apple has removed iODBC in OS X 10.9 Mavericks, but forgot to
	      remove all binaries, adopt configure so that will be possible
	      to build odbc with own installation.

   OTP-11744  Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
	      following applications: 

	      asn1, common_test, compiler, crypto, debugger, dialyzer,
	      edoc, eldap, erl_docgen, et, eunit, gs, hipe, inets,

	      (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

--- orber-3.6.27 --------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11678  Some local implementations of removing the last element from
	      a list are replaced by lists:droplast/1. Note that this
	      requires at least stdlib-2.0, which is the stdlib version
	      delivered in OTP 17.0. (Thanks to Hans Svensson)

--- os_mon-2.2.15 -------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-10842  Calls to erlang:open_port/2 with 'spawn' are updated to
	      handle space in the command path.

   OTP-11744  Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
	      following applications: 

	      asn1, common_test, compiler, crypto, debugger, dialyzer,
	      edoc, eldap, erl_docgen, et, eunit, gs, hipe, inets,

	      (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

--- ose-1.0 -------------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11334  Erlang/OTP has been ported to the realtime operating system
	      OSE. The port supports both smp and non-smp emulator. For
	      details around the port and how to started see the User's
	      Guide in the ose application. 

	      Note that not all parts of Erlang/OTP has been ported. 

	      Notable things that work are: non-smp and smp emulators, OSE
	      signal interaction, crypto, asn1, run_erl/to_erl, tcp, epmd,
	      distribution and most if not all non-os specific
	      functionality of Erlang.

	      Notable things that does not work are: udp/sctp, os_mon,
	      erl_interface, binding of schedulers.

--- otp_mibs-1.0.9 ------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11203  Add type based integer value truncation/reset.

	      This fixes errors when querying e.g. the erlNodeReductions,
	      erlNodeInBytes and erlNodeOutBytes objects in long-running
	      Erlang/OTP systems.

	      Update types of applicable MIB objects to 64bit based types.

	      Potential incompatibility: Type change of Counter32 to
	      Counter64 in OTP-MIB.mib

	      (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

--- pman ----------------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-10915  Removed gs based applications and gs based backends. The
	      observer application replaces the removed applications.

--- public_key-0.22 -----------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11578  Moved elliptic curve definition from the crypto NIF/OpenSSL
	      into Erlang code, adds the RFC-5639 brainpool curves and
	      makes TLS use them (RFC-7027).

	      Thanks to Andreas Schultz

   OTP-11627  Fix incorrect dialyzer spec and types, also enhance
	      documentation. 

	      Thanks to Ayaz Tuncer.

   OTP-11761  Handle v1 CRLs, with no extensions and fixes issues with IDP
	      (Issuing Distribution Point) comparison during CRL
	      validation. 

	      Thanks to Andrew Thompson

--- reltool-0.6.5 -------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11591  When adding a regexp to a filter in reltool using
	      {add,Regexp}, and the existing regexp was undefined, reltool
	      would crash since it got an improper list. This has been
	      corrected. (Thanks to Håkan Mattsson)

   OTP-11592  Adapted reltool test server to common test usage of
	      tc_status. (Note that this code is not used by OTP daily test
	      runs.) (Thanks to Håkan Mattsson)

   OTP-11744  Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
	      following applications: 

	      asn1, common_test, compiler, crypto, debugger, dialyzer,
	      edoc, eldap, erl_docgen, et, eunit, gs, hipe, inets,

	      (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

--- runtime_tools-1.8.14 ------------------------------------------------

   OTP-10877  Allow install path to have unicode characters.

   OTP-11603  The documentation for the return value of
	      dbg:{stop,stop_clear} functions are now correct (Thanks to
	      Luca Favatella)

   OTP-11622  Fix DTrace build on Illumos. (Thanks to Ryan Zezeski.)

   OTP-11662  The erts_alloc_config tool has been updated to produce
	      configurations that better fit todays SMP support in the VM.

   OTP-11693  Do not turn off scheduler_wall_time, as it can interfere with
	      other applications usage.

   OTP-11744  Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
	      following applications: 

	      asn1, common_test, compiler, crypto, debugger, dialyzer,
	      edoc, eldap, erl_docgen, et, eunit, gs, hipe, inets,
	      observer, odbc, os_mon, otp_mibs, parsetools, percept,

	      A new test utility for testing appup files is added to
	      test_server. This is now used by most applications in OTP.

	      (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

   OTP-11773  The app-file key runtime_dependencies has been introduced.

	      Runtime dependencies have been added to all app-files in OTP.
	      Note that these may not be completely correct during OTP 17,
	      but this is actively being worked on.

	      The function system_information:sanity_check/0 will verify
	      all declared runtime dependencies in the system when called.

--- sasl-2.4 ------------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-10842  Calls to erlang:open_port/2 with 'spawn' are updated to
	      handle space in the command path.

   OTP-11716  The upgrade instruction 'restart_application' would earlier
	      ignore the restart type configured in the .rel file and
	      always restart the application as permanent. This is now
	      changed, and the restart type from the .rel file is used. If
	      restart type is 'load', the application will only be loaded
	      and not started. If the restart type is 'none', the
	      application will not be loaded nor started, but all modules
	      in the application will be loaded. (Thanks to Tobias Schlager
	      for reporting this problem)

   OTP-11717  Some more documentation is added to explain the behavior when
	      an upgrade includes new versions of ERTS, Kernel, STDLIB or
	      SASL.

   OTP-11819  If systools:make_script/2 failed with reason
	      duplicate_modules, and the silent flag was not used, a crash
	      with reason function_clause would occur when systools tried
	      to format the error message. This has been corrected. (Thanks
	      to Jean-Sébastien Pédron)

--- snmp-4.25.1 ---------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11744  Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
	      following applications: 

	      asn1, common_test, compiler, crypto, debugger, dialyzer,
	      edoc, eldap, erl_docgen, et, eunit, gs, hipe, inets,
	      observer, odbc, os_mon, otp_mibs, parsetools, percept,
	      public_key, reltool, runtime_tools, ssh, syntax_tools,
	      test_server, tools, typer, webtool, wx, xmerl

	      A new test utility for testing appup files is added to
	      test_server. This is now used by most applications in OTP.

	      (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

--- ssh-3.0.1 -----------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-10732  Fixes the problem that ssh_cli in some cases could delay the
	      prompt if a tty was not requested by the client.

   OTP-10953  Ssh now fully supports unicode filenames, filecontents, shell
	      and cli. Please note that the underlying os and emulator must
	      also give support for unicode. You may want to start the
	      emulator with "erl +fnu" on Linux.

   OTP-11566  The variable NewCol is now correctly calculated allowing for
	      tab-completion of function calls even when preceded with
	      blank space (Thanks to Alexander Demidenko)

   OTP-11627  Fix incorrect dialyzer spec and types, also enhance
	      documentation. 

	      Thanks to Ayaz Tuncer.

   OTP-11671  Fixed a bug with the ssh file 'known_hosts' which made the
	      file grow with many equal entries.

   OTP-11678  Some local implementations of removing the last element from
	      a list are replaced by lists:droplast/1. Note that this
	      requires at least stdlib-2.0, which is the stdlib version
	      delivered in OTP 17.0. (Thanks to Hans Svensson)

   OTP-11680  Bug fix for ssh:daemon/2,3 so that the failfun is called when
	      it should.

   OTP-11705  dialyzer specs are now correct for ssh:start/0, ssh:start/1,
	      ssh:stop/0 and ssh_connection_handler:open_channel/5. (Thanks
	      to Johannes Weißl )

   OTP-11744  Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
	      following applications: 

	      asn1, common_test, compiler, crypto, debugger, dialyzer,
	      edoc, eldap, erl_docgen, et, eunit, gs, hipe, inets,
	      observer, odbc, os_mon, otp_mibs, parsetools, percept,
	      public_key, reltool, runtime_tools, ssh, syntax_tools,
	      test_server, tools, typer, webtool, wx, xmerl

	      A new test utility for testing appup files is added to
	      test_server. This is now used by most applications in OTP.

	      (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

   OTP-11821  Fixed dialyzer warning for ssh_connection:send.

   OTP-11823  ssh:daemon/2,3 : Added options negotiation_timeout and
	      parallel_login to tune the authentication behaviour.

--- ssl-5.3.4 -----------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11578  Moved elliptic curve definition from the crypto NIF/OpenSSL
	      into Erlang code, adds the RFC-5639 brainpool curves and
	      makes TLS use them (RFC-7027).

	      Thanks to Andreas Schultz

   OTP-11620  Unicode adaptations

   OTP-11621  Added option honor_cipher_order. This instructs the server to
	      prefer its own cipher ordering rather than the client's and
	      can help protect against things like BEAST while maintaining
	      compatability with clients which only support older ciphers. 

	      Thanks to Andrew Thompson for the implementation, and Andreas
	      Schultz for the test cases.

   OTP-11627  Fix incorrect dialyzer spec and types, also enhance
	      documentation. 

	      Thanks to Ayaz Tuncer.

   OTP-11634  Replace boolean checking in validate_option with is_boolean
	      guard. 

	      Thanks to Andreas Schultz.

   OTP-11702  Some function specs are corrected or moved and some edoc
	      comments are corrected in order to allow use of edoc. (Thanks
	      to Pierre Fenoll)

   OTP-11712  Fix possible mismatch between SSL/TLS version and default
	      ciphers. Could happen when you specified SSL/TLS-version in
	      optionlist to listen or accept.

   OTP-11733  Correct clean up of certificate database when certs are
	      inputed in pure DER format.The incorrect code could cause a
	      memory leek when certs where inputed in DER. Thanks to
	      Bernard Duggan for reporting this.

   OTP-11744  Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
	      following applications: 

	      asn1, common_test, compiler, crypto, debugger, dialyzer,
	      edoc, eldap, erl_docgen, et, eunit, gs, hipe, inets,
	      observer, odbc, os_mon, otp_mibs, parsetools, percept,
	      public_key, reltool, runtime_tools, ssh, syntax_tools,
	      test_server, tools, typer, webtool, wx, xmerl

	      A new test utility for testing appup files is added to
	      test_server. This is now used by most applications in OTP.

	      (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

   OTP-11759  Improved documentation of the cacertfile option

   OTP-11760  Avoid next protocol negotiation failure due to incorrect
	      option format.

   OTP-11761  Handle v1 CRLs, with no extensions and fixes issues with IDP
	      (Issuing Distribution Point) comparison during CRL
	      validation. 

	      Thanks to Andrew Thompson

   OTP-11780  Server now ignores client ECC curves that it does not support
	      instead of crashing. 

	      Thanks to Danil Zagoskin for reporting the issue and
	      suggesting a solution.

   OTP-11815  Handle SNI (Server Name Indication) alert unrecognized_name
	      and gracefully deal with unexpected alerts. 

	      Thanks to Masatake Daimon for reporting this.

   OTP-11837  Add possibility to specify ssl options when calling
	      ssl:ssl_accept

--- stdlib-2.0 ----------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-10285  Options to set match_limit and match_limit_recursion are
	      added to re:run. The option report_errors is also added to
	      get more information when re:run fails due to limits or
	      compilation errors.

   OTP-10342  The pre-defined types array/0, dict/0, digraph/0, gb_set/0,
	      gb_tree/0, queue/0, set/0, and tid/0 have been deprecated.
	      They will be removed in Erlang/OTP 18.0.

	      Instead the types array:array/0, dict:dict/0,
	      digraph:graph/0, gb_set:set/0, gb_tree:tree/0, queue:queue/0,
	      sets:set/0, and ets:tid/0 can be used. (Note: it has always
	      been necessary to use ets:tid/0.)

	      It is allowed in Erlang/OTP 17.0 to locally re-define the
	      types array/0, dict/0, and so on.

	      New types array:array/1, dict:dict/2, gb_sets:set/1,
	      gb_trees:tree/2, queue:queue/1, and sets:set/1 have been
	      added.

	      A compiler option, nowarn_deprecated_type, has been
	      introduced. By including the attribute

	      -compile(nowarn_deprecated_type).

	      in an Erlang source file, warnings about deprecated types can
	      be avoided in Erlang/OTP 17.0.

	      The option can also be given as a compiler flag:

	      erlc +nowarn_deprecated_type file.erl

   OTP-10842  Calls to erlang:open_port/2 with 'spawn' are updated to
	      handle space in the command path.

   OTP-10908  Dialyzer's unmatched_return warnings have been corrected.

   OTP-11186  Forbid unsized fields in patterns of binary generators and
	      simplified v3_core's translation of bit string generators.
	      (Thanks to Anthony Ramine.)

   OTP-11204  The version of the PCRE library Used by Erlang's re module is
	      raised to 8.33 from 7.6. This means, among other things,
	      better Unicode and Unicode Character Properties support. New
	      options connected to PCRE 8.33 are also added to the re
	      module (ucd, notempty_atstart, no_start_optimize). PCRE has
	      extended the regular expression syntax between 7.6 and 8.33,
	      why this imposes a potential incompatibility. Only very
	      complicated regular expressions may be affected, but if you
	      know you are using obscure features, please test run your
	      regular expressions and verify that their behavior has not
	      changed.

   OTP-11205  The option dupnames did not work as intended in re. When
	      looking for names with {capture, [Name, ...]}, re:run
	      returned a random instance of the match for that name,
	      instead of the leftmost matching instance, which was what the
	      documentation stated. This is now corrected to adhere to the
	      documentation. The option {capture,all_names} along with a
	      re:inspect/2 function is also added to further help in using
	      named subpatterns.

   OTP-11353  Added dict:is_empty/1 and orddict:is_empty/1. (Thanks to
	      Magnus Henoch.)

   OTP-11388  A call to either the garbage_collect/1 BIF or the
	      check_process_code/2 BIF may trigger garbage collection of
	      another processes than the process calling the BIF. The
	      previous implementations performed these kinds of garbage
	      collections without considering the internal state of the
	      process being garbage collected. In order to be able to more
	      easily and more efficiently implement yielding native code,
	      these types of garbage collections have been rewritten. A
	      garbage collection like this is now triggered by an
	      asynchronous request signal, the actual garbage collection is
	      performed by the process being garbage collected itself, and
	      finalized by a reply signal to the process issuing the
	      request. Using this approach processes can disable garbage
	      collection and yield without having to set up the heap in a
	      state that can be garbage collected.

	      The garbage_collect/2, and check_process_code/3 BIFs have
	      been introduced. Both taking an option list as last argument.
	      Using these, one can issue asynchronous requests.

	      code:purge/1 and code:soft_purge/1 have been rewritten to
	      utilize asynchronous check_process_code requests in order to
	      parallelize work.

	      Characteristics impact: A call to the garbage_collect/1 BIF
	      or the check_process_code/2 BIF will normally take longer
	      time to complete while the system as a whole wont be as much
	      negatively effected by the operation as before. A call to
	      code:purge/1 and code:soft_purge/1 may complete faster or
	      slower depending on the state of the system while the system
	      as a whole wont be as much negatively effected by the
	      operation as before.

   OTP-11399  Improve the documentation of the supervisor's via reference.
	      (Thanks to MaximMinin.)

   OTP-11552  orddict:from_list/1 now uses the optimized sort routines in
	      the lists module instead of (essentially) an insertion sort.
	      Depending on the input data, the speed of the new from_list/1
	      is anything from slightly faster up to several orders of
	      magnitude faster than the old from_list/1. (Thanks to Steve
	      Vinoski.)

   OTP-11589  If option 'binary' was set for standard_input, then c:i()
	      would hang if the output was more than one page long - i.e.
	      then input after "(c)ontinue (q)uit -->" could not be read.
	      This has been corrected. (Thanks to José Valim)

   OTP-11616  EEP43: New data type - Maps

	      With Maps you may for instance:

	      -- M0 = #{ a => 1, b => 2}, % create associations

	      -- M1 = M0#{ a := 10 }, % update values

	      -- M2 = M1#{ "hi" => "hello"}, % add new associations

	      -- #{ "hi" := V1, a := V2, b := V3} = M2. % match keys with
	      values

	      For information on how to use Maps please see the Reference
	      Manual.

	      The current implementation is without the following features:

	      -- No variable keys

	      -- No single value access

	      -- No map comprehensions

	      Note that Maps is experimental during OTP 17.0.

   OTP-11677  stdlib/lists: Add function droplast/1 This functions drops
	      the last element of a non-empty list. lists:last/1 and
	      lists:droplast/1 are the dual of hd/1 and tl/1 but for the
	      end of a list. (Thanks to Hans Svensson)

   OTP-11682  Allow all auto imports to be suppressed at once. Introducing
	      the no_auto_import attribute: -compile(no_auto_import).
	      Useful for code generation tools that always use the
	      qualified function names and want to avoid the auto imported
	      functions clashing with local ones. (Thanks to José Valim.)

   OTP-11684  When tab completing the erlang shell now expands zero-arity
	      functions all the way to closing parenthesis, unless there is
	      another function with the same name and a different arity.
	      (Thanks to Pierre Fenoll.)

   OTP-11685  supervisor_bridge does no longer report normal termination of
	      children. The reason is that in some cases, for instance when
	      the restart strategy is simple_one_for_one, the log could be
	      completely overloaded with reports about normally terminating
	      processes. (Thanks to Artem Ocheredko)

   OTP-11707  The type annotations for alternative registries using the
	      {via, Module, Name} syntax for sup_name() and sup_ref() in
	      the supervisor module are now consistent with the
	      documentation. Dialyzer should no longer complain about valid
	      supervisor:start_link() and supervisor:start_child() calls.
	      (Thanks to Caleb Helbling.)

   OTP-11709  Two Dets bugs have been fixed. When trying to open a short
	      file that is not a Dets file, the file was deleted even with
	      just read access. Calling dets:is_dets_file/1 with a file
	      that is not a Dets file, a file descriptor was left open.
	      (Thanks to Håkan Mattsson for reporting the bugs.)

   OTP-11726  Fix race bug in ets:all. Concurrent creation of tables could
	      cause other tables to not be included in the result. (Thanks
	      to Florian Schintke for bug report)

   OTP-11728  The Erlang Code Preprocessor (epp) could loop when
	      encountering a circular macro definition in an included file.
	      This bug has been fixed.

	      Thanks to Maruthavanan Subbarayan for reporting the bug, and
	      to Richard Carlsson for providing a bug fix.

   OTP-11747  erl_eval now properly evaluates '=='/2 when it is used in
	      guards. (Thanks to José Valim)

   OTP-11752  Calls to proplists:get_value/3 are replaced by the faster
	      lists:keyfind/3 in io_lib_pretty. Elements in the list are
	      always 2-tuples. (Thanks to Andrew Thompson)

   OTP-11758  A qlc bug where filters were erroneously optimized away has
	      been fixed. Thanks to Sam Bobroff for reporting the bug.

   OTP-11770  A number of compiler errors where unusual or nonsensical code
	      would crash the compiler have been reported by Ulf Norell and
	      corrected by Anthony Ramine.

   OTP-11771  The Erlang Code Linter (erl_lint) has since Erlang/OTP R13B
	      emitted warnings whenever any of the types arity(),
	      bitstring(), iodata(), or boolean() were re-defined. Now
	      errors are emitted instead.

   OTP-11772  Since Erlang/OTP R16B the Erlang Core Linter (erl_lint) has
	      not emitted errors when built-in types were re-defined. This
	      bug has been fixed. (Thanks to Roberto Aloi.)

   OTP-11807  The encoding option of erl_parse:abstract/2 has been extended
	      to include none and a callback function (a predicate).

   OTP-11817  The functions sys:get_state/1,2 and sys:replace_state/2,3 are
	      fixed so they can now be run while the process is sys
	      suspended. To accomplish this, the new callbacks
	      Mod:system_get_state/1 and Mod:system_replace_state/2 are
	      added, which are also implemented by the generic behaviours
	      gen_server, gen_event and gen_fsm.

	      The potential incompatibility refers to

	      -- The previous behaviour of intercepting the system message
	      and passing a tuple of size 2 as the last argument to
	      sys:handle_system_msg/6 is no longer supported.

	      -- The error handling when StateFun in sys:replace_state/2,3
	      fails is changed from being totally silent to possibly (if
	      the callback module does not catch) throw an exception in the
	      client process.

	      (Thanks to James Fish and Steve Vinoski)

   OTP-11828  Export zip option types to allow referal from other modules.

	      Thanks to Pierre Fenoll and Håkan Mattson

   OTP-11840  The module pg has been deprecated and will be removed in
	      Erlang/OTP 18.

--- syntax_tools-1.6.14 -------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11632  Add implementation of having erl_tidy print to screen instead
	      of writing to the file provided. (Thanks to Aaron France)

   OTP-11663  Support Maps syntax in syntax_tools (Thanks to Anthony
	      Ramine).

   OTP-11744  Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
	      following applications:

	      test_server. This is now used by most applications in OTP.

	      (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

--- test_server-3.7 -----------------------------------------------------

   OTP-10842  Calls to erlang:open_port/2 with 'spawn' are updated to

	      (Thanks to Paul Oliver)

   OTP-11601  Emacs mode improvements (Thanks to Steve Vinoski)

   OTP-11692  cover can run on itself. Also, support for reading BEAM files
	      produced by ancient OTP versions before R9C has been removed.

	      (Thanks to Phil Hagelberg)

--- tv ------------------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-10915  Removed gs based applications and gs based backends. The
	      observer application replaces the removed applications.

--- typer-0.9.6 ---------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11616  EEP43: New data type - Maps

	      With Maps you may for instance:

	      -- M0 = #{ a => 1, b => 2}, % create associations

	      -- M1 = M0#{ a := 10 }, % update values

	      -- M2 = M1#{ "hi" => "hello"}, % add new associations

	      -- #{ "hi" := V1, a := V2, b := V3} = M2. % match keys with
	      values

	      For information on how to use Maps please see the Reference
	      Manual.

	      The current implementation is without the following features:

	      -- No variable keys

	      -- No single value access

	      -- No map comprehensions

	      Note that Maps is experimental during OTP 17.0.

   OTP-11586  Refactored C++ code, fixed crashes and a deadlock on linux.

   OTP-11678  Some local implementations of removing the last element from
	      a list are replaced by lists:droplast/1. Note that this
	      requires at least stdlib-2.0, which is the stdlib version
	      delivered in OTP 17.0. (Thanks to Hans Svensson)

   OTP-11699  Reworked the internal event handling to avoid crashes in
	      destroy objects. Thanks Tom for the bug report.
