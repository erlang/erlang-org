Abstract
========

This EEP proposes the creation of a new module named b\_trees for the
administration of b-trees.  Both the optional persistence and the sort
order should be implemented by pluggable functionality.

Specification
=============

Data Structure
--------------

```erlang
{MinimumSubtrees,
 MaximumKeys,
 SizeKeyValues,
 SortFunction/2,
 State,
 Tree}
```

`Tree` is composed of nodes of the form

```erlang
{KeyNumber,
 SubtreeNumber,
 [{Key, Value}],
 [Tree]}
```

and the "empty b-tree" node

```erlang
nil
```

`State` is a tuple composed of the following parameters:

```erlang
{StateTarget,
 DeleteFunction/3,
 InsertFunction/3,
 LookupFunction/3}
```

Since the b-trees are always balanced, there is no need for a balance
operation.

DATA TYPES
----------

```erlang
b_tree() = {pos_integer(),
            pos_integer(),
            non_neg_integer(),
            sort_function(),
            state(),
            tree()}
```

A general balanced tree.

```erlang
iterator() = [{key_values(), subtrees()}]
```

A general balanced tree iterator.

EXPORTS
-------

### copy(Tree1, Tree2) -> Tree3

Types:

```erlang
Tree1 = Tree2 = Tree3 = b_tree() | gb_trees:tree()
```

Copies tree Tree1 to an empty tree Tree2. Both trees may be either
of type b-tree or binary tree (gb_trees). Returns the new tree
Tree3 of the same type as tree Tree2.

### delete(Key, B-Tree1) -> B-Tree2

Types:

```erlang
Key = any()
B-Tree1 = B-Tree2 = b_tree()
```

Removes the node with key Key from b-tree B-Tree1 and returns the new
b-tree B-Tree2.  Assumes that key Key is present in b-tree B-Tree1,
crashes otherwise.

### delete\_any (Key, B-Tree1) -> B-Tree2

Types:

```erlang
Key = any()
B-Tree1 = B-Tree2 = b_tree()
```

Removes the node with key Key from b-tree B-Tree1 if key Key is present
in b-tree B-Tree1, otherwise does nothing.  Returns the new b-tree B-Tree2.

### empty (Order) -> B-Tree

Types:

```erlang
Order = pos_integer()
B-Tree = b_tree()
```

Returns a new empty b-tree.  The order is defined as the maximum number
of children nodes a non-leaf node may hold.

### enter (Key, Value, B-Tree1) -> B-Tree2

Types:

```erlang
Key = any()
Value = any()
B-Tree1 = B-Tree2 = b_tree()
```

Inserts key Key with value Value into b-tree B-Tree1 if key Key is not
present in b-tree B-Tree1, otherwise updates the current value of key Key
to value Value in b-tree B-Tree1.  Returns a new b-tree B-Tree2.

### from\_dict (B-Tree1, List) -> B-Tree2

Types:

```erlang
B-Tree1 = B-Tree2 = b_tree()
List = [{Key, Value}]
```

Turns an ordered list List of key value tuples into a b-tree.  The given
b-tree B-Tree1 must be empty.  The list must not contain duplicate keys.

### get (Key, B-Tree) -> Value

Types:

```erlang
Key = any()
B-Tree = b_tree()
Value = any()
```

Retrieves the value stored with key Key in b-tree B-Tree.  Assumes that
key Key is present in b-tree B-Tree, crashes otherwise.

### height (B-Tree) -> integer() >= 0

Types:

```erlang
B-Tree = b_tree()
```

Returns the height of b-tree B-Tree as an integer.  Assumes that b-tree
B-Tree is non-empty.

### insert (Key, Value, B-Tree1) -> B-Tree2

Types:

```erlang
Key = any()
Value = any()
B-Tree1 = B-Tree2 = b_tree()
```

Inserts key Key with value Value into b-tree  B-Tree1 and returns the new
b-tree B-Tree2.  Assumes that key Key is **not** present in b-tree B-Tree1,
crashes otherwise.

### is\_defined (Key, B-Tree) -> boolean()

Types:

```erlang
Key = any()
B-Tree = b_tree()
```

Returns `true` if key Key is present in b-tree B-Tree, otherwise `false`.

### is\_empty (B-Tree) -> boolean()

Types:

```erlang
B-Tree = b_tree()
```

Returns `true` if b-tree B-Tree is an empty b-tree, otherwise `false`.

### iterator (B-Tree) -> Iterator

Types:

```erlang
B-Tree = b_tree()
Iterator = iterator()
```

Returns iterator Iterator that can be used for traversing the entries
of b-tree B-Tree; see `next/1`.  The implementation of this iterator is
very efficient; traversing the whole b-tree using `next/1` is only slightly
slower than getting the list of all key-value pairs using `to_list/1`
and traversing that.  The main advantage of the iterator approach is that
it does not require the complete list of all key-value pairs to be built
in memory at one time.

### iterator\_from (Key, B-Tree) -> Iterator

Types:

```erlang
Key = any(9
B-Tree = b_tree()
Iterator = iterator()
```

Returns iterator Iterator that can be used for traversing the entries
of b-tree B-Tree; see `next/1`.  The difference, as compared to the
iterator returned by iterator/1, is that the first key greater than
or equal to key Key is returned.

### keys (B-Tree) -> [Key]

Types:

```erlang
B-Tree = b_tree()
Key = any()
```

Returns the keys in b-tree B-Tree as an ordered list.

```

Returns a tuple {Key, Value}, where Key is the largest key in b-tree
B-Tree, and Value is the value associated with this key.  Assumes that
b-tree B-Tree is not empty.

### lookup (Key, B-Tree) -> none | {value, Value}

Types:

```erlang
Key = any()
B-Tree = b_tree()
Value = any()
```

Looks up key Key in b-tree B-Tree. Returns {value, Value}, or none if
key Key is not present.

### map (Function, B-Tree1) -> B-Tree2

Types:

```erlang
Function = fun((Key, Value1) -> Value2)
B-Tree1 = B-Tree2 = b_tree()
Key = any()
Value1 = Value2 = any()
```

Maps function Function(Key, Value1) -> Value2 to all key value pairs of
b-tree B-Tree1.  Returns the new b-tree B-Tree2 with the same set of
keys as b-tree B-Tree1 and the new set of values.

### next (Iterator1) -> 'none' | {Key, Value, Iterator2}

Types:

```erlang
Iterator1 = Iterator2 = iterator()
Key = any()
Value = any()
```

Returns the tuple {Key, Value, Iterator2}, where Key is the smallest
key referred to by iterator Iterator1, and iterator Iterator2 is the
new iterator to be used for traversing the remaining nodes, or the
atom '**none**' if no nodes remain.

### set\_parameter (B-Tree1, Name, Value) -> B-Tree2

Types:

```erlang
B-Tree1 = B-Tree2 = b_tree()
Name : Value = sort  : Function = fun((Key1, Key2) -> equal |

                                                      less)
             | state : {StateTarget,
                        Function = fun(StateTarget, delete, Key)
                                 -> true,
                        Function = fun(StateTarget, insert, Subtrees)
                                 -> Key,
                        Function = fun(StateTarget, lookup, Key)
                                 -> Subtrees}
```

Pluggable Persistence Functionality
-----------------------------------

### Format

```erlang
{StateTarget, DeleteFunction, InsertFunction, LookupFunction}

StateTarget = any()

DeleteFunction(StateTarget, delete, Key) -> true

InsertFunction(StateTarget, insert, Subtrees) -> Key

LookupFunction(StateTarget, lookup, Key) -> Subtrees
```

Examples for state targets are a Dets table or a Mnesia table.  The delete
function takes a state target, the atom `delete` and a key as arguments
and returns the atom `true` if successful.  The insert function takes a
state target, the atom `insert` and a subtrees data structure as arguments
and returns a key if successful.  The lookup function takes a state target,
the atom `lookup` and a key as arguments and returns a subtrees data
structure if successful.

### Example functions

The following examples are based on Mnesia.

```erlang
persistence_by_mnesia(_, delete, SubtreesKey)
                     when is_list(SubtreesKey) ->
    true;
persistence_by_mnesia(StateTarget, delete, SubtreesKey) ->
    F = fun() ->
        ok = mnesia:delete({StateTarget, SubtreesKey}),
        true
    end,
    mnesia:activity(transaction, F);

persistence_by_mnesia(_, insert, []) ->
    [];
persistence_by_mnesia(StateTarget, insert,
                      [{_, _, [{Key, _} | _], _} | _] = Subtrees) ->
    SubtreesKey = list_to_binary(Key),
    F = fun() ->
        ok = mnesia:write(StateTarget,
                          #subtrees{subtreesKey = SubtreesKey,
                          subtrees = Subtrees}, write),
        SubtreesKey
    end,
    mnesia:activity(transaction, F);

persistence_by_mnesia(_, lookup, SubtreesKey)
                     when is_list(SubtreesKey) ->
    SubtreesKey;
persistence_by_mnesia(StateTarget, lookup, SubtreesKey) ->
    F = fun() ->
        [{subtrees, SubtreesKey, Subtrees}] = mnesia:read(StateTarget,
                                                          SubtreesKey),
        Subtrees
    end,
mnesia:activity(transaction, F).
```

### Example usage

Creating the Mnesia table:

```erlang
-record(subtrees, {subtreesKey, subtrees}).

{atomic, ok} = mnesia:create_table(StateTargetName, [{record_name,
                                                      subtrees}]),
```

Creating the b-tree:

```erlang
BTree1 = b_trees:empty(500),
BTree2 = b_trees:set_parameter(BTree1, state,
                               {StateTargetName,
                                fun persistence_by_mnesia/3,
                                fun persistence_by_mnesia/3,
                                fun persistence_by_mnesia/3}),
```

Pluggable Sort Functionality
----------------------------

### Format

```erlang
FunctionName(Key1, Key2) -> equal | greater | less

Key1 = Key2 = any()
```

The sort function takes two keys as arguments and returns the atom `less`
if Key1 < Key2, the atom `greater` if Key1 > Key2 and otherwise the
atom `equal`.

### Example function

```erlang
-spec sort_descending(key(), key()) -> sort_result().

sort_descending(Key_1, Key_2) ->
if
    Key_1 < Key_2 -> greater;
    Key_1 > Key_2 -> less;
    true -> equal
end.
```

### Example usage

```erlang
BTree1 = b_trees:empty(500),
BTree2 = b_trees:set_parameter(BTree1, sort, fun sort_descending/2),
```

Motivation
==========

B-trees are self-balancing tree data structures that keep data sorted
and allow searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in
logarithmic time.  B-trees are a generalization of a binary search
trees in that a node can have more than two children.  Unlike self-balancing
binary search trees, the b-tree is optimized for systems that read and
write large blocks of data.  B-trees are a good example of a data structure
for external memory.

Rationale
=========

The functional design of the module b\_trees is based on the module gb\_trees:

```erlang
 b_trees          | gb_trees
------------------|---------
 n/a              | balance/1
 copy/2           | n/a
 delete/2         | delete/2
 delete_any/2     | delete_any/2
 empty/1          | empty/0
 enter/3          | enter/3
 from_dict/2      | from_orddict/1
 get/2            | get/2
 height/1         | n/a
 insert/3         | insert/3
 is_defined/2     | is_defined/2
 is_empty/1       | is_empty/1
 iterator/1       | iterator/1
 iterator_from/2  | iterator_from/2
 keys/1           | keys/1
 largest/1        | largest/1
 lookup/2         | lookup/2
 map/2            | map/2
 next/1           | next/1
 set_parameter/3  | n/a
 size_key_values/1| size/1
 size_nodes/1     | n/a
 smallest/1       | smallest/1
 sort_ascending/2 | n/a
 sort_descending/2| n/a
 take/2           | take/2
 take_any/2       | take_any/2
 take_largest/1   | take_largest/1
 take_smallest/1  | take_smallest/1
 to_list/1        | to_list/1
 update/3         | update/3
 values/1         | values/1
```

The functions `delete/2` and `insert/3` are implementations of the algorithms
