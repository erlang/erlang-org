## Mailing lists mini-HowTo
The mailing lists are [Mailman](http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/) mailing lists. They have a [web interface](https://erlang.org/mailman/listinfo/) explaining what you need to know about handling your subscription.

You have to be a member to post. This reduces spam to a tolerable level. You can subscribe for every post, digest of posts or no-mail subscription to be able to post but read some other way e.g the archives or maybe Google Groups.
