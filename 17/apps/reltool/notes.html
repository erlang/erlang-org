<h1>1 Reltool Release Notes</h1>
  
  <p>This document describes the changes made to the Reltool system
    from version to version. The intention of this document is to
    list all incompatibilities as well as all enhancements and
    bugfixes for every release of Reltool. Each release of Reltool
    thus constitutes one section in this document. The title of each
    section is the version number of Reltool.</p>

  <h3><a name="id60126">1.1 
        Reltool 0.6.6</a></h3>

    <h4>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Fixed a minor typo in an error message from
	    reltool_server.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-11977</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    



<h3><a name="id60154">1.2 
        Reltool 0.6.5</a></h3>

    <h4>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    When adding a regexp to a filter in reltool using
	    {add,Regexp}, and the existing regexp was undefined,
	    reltool would crash since it got an improper list. This
	    has been corrected. (Thanks to Håkan Mattsson)</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-11591</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Adapted reltool test server to common test usage of
	    tc_status. (Note that this code is not used by OTP daily
	    test runs.) (Thanks to Håkan Mattsson)</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-11592</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
	    following applications: </p>
          <p>
	    <span class="code">asn1, common_test, compiler, crypto, debugger,
	    dialyzer, edoc, eldap, erl_docgen, et, eunit, gs, hipe,
	    inets, observer, odbc, os_mon, otp_mibs, parsetools,
	    percept, public_key, reltool, runtime_tools, ssh,
	    syntax_tools, test_server, tools, typer, webtool, wx,
	    xmerl</span></p>
          <p>
	    A new test utility for testing appup files is added to
	    test_server. This is now used by most applications in
	    OTP.</p>
          <p>
	    (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)</p>

      </ul>
    



<h3><a name="id58817">1.3 
        Reltool 0.6.4.1</a></h3>

    <h4>Improvements and New Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    The encoding of the <span class="code">notes.xml</span> file has been
	    changed from latin1 to utf-8 to avoid future merge
	    problems.</p>
          <p>

<h3><a name="id58848">1.4 
        Reltool 0.6.4</a></h3>

    <h4>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Fix receive support in erl_eval with a BEAM module.
	    Thanks to Anthony Ramine.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-11137</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    


    <h4>Improvements and New Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Reltool used to fail if an application was mentioned in
	    the config file which was not found in the file system,
	    even if the application was explicitly excluded in the
	    config. This has been changed and will only produce a
	    warning. If the application is not explicitly excluded it
	    will still cause reltool to fail. Thanks to Håkan
	    Mattsson!</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-10988</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Fix possibly "not owner" error while file copy with
	    reltool. Thanks to Alexey Saltanov.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-11099</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    



<h3><a name="id56520">1.5 
        Reltool 0.6.3</a></h3>

    <h4>Improvements and New Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Some updates are made to reltool for handling unicode.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-10781</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    



<h3><a name="id56550">1.6 
        Reltool 0.6.2</a></h3>

    <h4>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    <ul> <li> If <span class="code">incl_cond</span> was set to
	    <span class="code">derived</span> on module level, then reltool_server would
	    crash with a <span class="code">case_clause</span>. This has been corrected.
	    <span class="code">incl_cond</span> on module level now overwrites
	    <span class="code">mod_cond</span> on app or sys level as described in the
	    documentation. </li> <li> If a <span class="code">rel</span> spec in the
	    reltool config does not contain all applications that are
	    listed as <span class="code">{applications,Applications}</span> in a
	    <span class="code">.app</span> file, then these applications are
	    autmatically added when creating the <span class="code">.rel</span> file.
	    For 'included_applications', the behaviour was not the
	    same. I.e. if a <span class="code">rel</span> spec in the reltool config did
	    not contain all applications that are listed as
	    <span class="code">{included_applications,InclApplications}</span> in a
	    <span class="code">.app</span> file, then reltool would fail with reason
	    "Undefined applications" when creating the <span class="code">.rel</span>
	    file. This has been corrected, so both
	    <span class="code">applications</span> and <span class="code">included_applications</span> are
	    now automatically added if not already in the <span class="code">rel</span>
	    spec. </li> <li> The <span class="code">rel</span> specification now
	    dictates the order in which included and used
	    applications (specified in the <span class="code">.app</span> file as
	    <span class="code">included_applications</span> and <span class="code">applications</span>
	    respectively) are loaded/started by the boot file. If the
	    applications are not specified in the <span class="code">rel</span> spec,
	    then the order from the <span class="code">.app</span> file is used. This
	    was a bug earlier reported on systools, and is now also
	    implemented in reltool. </li> <li> Instead of only
	    looking at the directory name, reltool now first looks
	    for a <span class="code">.app</span> file in order to figure out the name of
	    an application. </li> </ul></p>

    <h4>Improvements and New Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
	    <p> Some examples overflowing the width of PDF pages have
	    been corrected. </p>

<h3><a name="id64188">1.7 
        Reltool 0.6.1</a></h3>

    <h4>Improvements and New Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    A new sys level configuration parameter
	    <span class="code">{excl_lib,otp_root}</span> is added. When this is set,
	    the target system will not contain anything from
	    <span class="code">$OTP_ROOT</span>. It will only contain a releases
	    directory with rel, script and boot files, and a lib
	    directory with applications found outside of
	    <span class="code">$OTP_ROOT</span> (i.e. "your own" applications).</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-9743</p>

      </ul>
    



<h3><a name="id64231">1.8 
        Reltool 0.6</a></h3>

    <h4>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Miscellaneous corrections: <ul> <li> Start of reltool
	    GUI would sometimes crash with a badmatch in
	    reltool_sys_win:do_init. This has been corrected. </li>
	    <li> Minor corrections of documentation and type
	    specifications of app() and mod() are done. </li>
	    <li> If a module name is duplicated in an app file
	    reltool would return an error. This is now changed to a
	    warning. </li> <li> Reltool would earlier not
	    necessarily keep the order of applications as listed in
	    the rel specification in the configuration. This has been
	    corrected. </li> <li> Reltool would earlier set the
	    default for included applications to an empty list if it
	    was not set in the rel specification in the
	    configuration. This was correct according to
	    sasl/systools documentation, but not according to
	    sasl/systools implementation. We decided to change the
	    documentation and reltool to use the value of
	    included_applications from the .app file as default
	    instead of the empty list, since this seems more
	    intuitive and since systools always has done the same.
	    </li> <li> The value of included applications in the
	    rel specification in the configuration did not overwrite
	    included_applications in the .app file if it was set to
	    an empty list. This has been corrected. </li> <li>
	    Reltool would earlier add load instructions in the
	    script/boot files for ALL modules in the ebin directory
	    of an application even if mod_cond was set to app
	    (include only modules listed in the .app file). This has
	    been corrected. </li> <li> Reltool would earlier add
	    start instructions in the script/boot file for included
	    applications. This has been corrected - included
	    applications shall only be loaded since the including
	    application is responsible for starting them. </li>
	    <li> Status bar now indicates that reltool is working
	    (Processing libraries...) for all configuration changes,
	    and when generating target system. </li> <li> Title
	    of dependecies column in app and mod window is changed
	    from "Modules used by others" to "Modules using this".
	    </li> </ul></p>

	    Own Id: OTP-9792</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Configuration changes via the GUI had a few bugs related
	    to error handling, rollback and undo. A major re-write of
	    the reltool_server has been done in order to align the
	    way reltool_server updates and uses its state and tables
	    for all different kinds of configuration change. </p>
          <p>
	    All configuration changes (except undo) now cause a
	    re-read of the file system, meaning that if something has
	    changed in the file system it will be reflected in the
	    result of the configuration change.</p>
          <p>
	    When loading a new configuration file via the GUI, the
	    old configuration is now completely scratched, and only
	    the new is valid.</p>

	    *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p>

	    Own Id: OTP-9794</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Some bug fixes related to the handling of escripts:
	    <ul> <li> Reltool could not handle escripts with
	    inlined applications. This has been corrected. Inlined
	    applications will be visible in the GUI, but not possible
	    to include/exclude separately. </li> <li> Loading a
	    config which contains an escript via the GUI menu did not
	    produce the same result as when using the same
	    configuration at reltool start. Paths, version and label
	    could differ. This has been corrected. </li> <li>
	    Loading config with same escript (source) twice caused
	    reltool to add same module twice. This has been
	    corrected. </li> <li> Loading config with same
	    escript (inlined beam) twice caused reltool to fail
	    saying module is included by two different applications.
	    This has been corrected. </li> <li> Loading config
	    which in addition to an existing escript also adds
	    another escript, for which the name sorts before the
	    existing one, would cause reltool to fail saying
	    "Application name clash". This has been corrected.
	    </li> </ul></p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-9968</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Reltool would sometimes generate a .app file containing
	    <span class="code">{start_phases,undefined}</span>, which would cause an
	    exception in systools at parse time. This has been
	    corrected so reltool now omits the <span class="code">start_phases</span>
	    entry if the value is <span class="code">undefined</span>. (Thanks to Juan
	    Jose Comellas)</p>
          <p>
	    In order to align with reltool, sasl will also omit
	    <span class="code">start_phases</span> entries with value <span class="code">undefined</span>
	    in .script files.</p>

    <h4>Improvements and New Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    A warning list is added to the sys window of the reltool
	    GUI. This list will continuously show all warnings
	    produced by the current configuration.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-9967</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    As a way of specifying one specific version of an
	    application, the following configuration parameter is
	    added on application level:</p>
          <p>
	    {lib_dir,Dir}, Dir = string()</p>
          <p>
	    This can be useful if the parent directory of the
	    application directory is not suitable to use as a lib dir
	    on system level.</p>

<h3><a name="id64470">1.9 
        Reltool 0.5.7.1</a></h3>

    <h4>Improvements and New Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Added recommendation about <span class="code">RootDir</span> parameter to
	    <span class="code">reltool:eval_target_spec/3</span>.</p>

<h3><a name="id64507">1.10 
        Reltool 0.5.7</a></h3>

    <h4>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    If a module was duplicated in the library directories
	    visible to reltool, and the configuration did not point
	    out which file to use, then reltool:start would always
	    fail. A pop-up is added which asks if you want to
	    continue with a safe and minimal configuration.</p>

          <p>
            Added function <span class="code">zip:foldl/3</span> to iterate over zip

          <p>
            Added functions to create and extract escripts. See
            <span class="code">escript:create/2</span> and <span class="code">escript:extract/2</span>.</p>
          <p>
            The undocumented function <span class="code">escript:foldl/3</span> has been
            removed. The same functionality can be achieved with the
            more flexible functions <span class="code">escript:extract/2</span> and
            <span class="code">zip:foldl/3</span>.</p>
          <p>
            Record fields has been annotated with type info. Source
            files as been adapted to fit within 80 chars and trailing

            <p>A new escript, called <span class="code">reltool</span>, has been
            introduced in order to simplify the usage of the reltool
            application from makefiles.</p>
            <p>The handling of applications included in releases has
            been improved. Applications that are required to be
            started before other applications in a release are now
            automatically included in the release. The <span class="code">kernel</span>
            and <span class="code">stdlib</span> applications are always included as
            they are mandatory.</p>
            <p>Applications that are (explicitly or implicitly)
            included in a release are now automatically included as
            if they were explicitly included with the incl_cond
            flag.</p>
            <p>A new <span class="code">embedded_app_type</span> option has been
            introduced. It is intended to be used for embedded
            systems where all included applications must be loaded
            from the boot script, as these systems does not utilize
            dynamic code loading. If <span class="code">embedded_app_type </span> is set
            to something else than <span class="code">undefined</span>, all included
            applications will be included in both the release as well
            as in the boot script. If the <span class="code">profile</span> is
            <span class="code">embedded</span> the <span class="code">embedded_app_type</span> option
            defaults to <span class="code">load</span>.</p>
            <p>A new function called <span class="code">reltool:get_status/1</span> has
            been introduced. It returns status about the
            configuration in the server.</p>
            <p>The API functions that may take <span class="code">PidOrOptions</span> as
            input and actually gets <span class="code">Options</span> does now print out
            warnings.</p>
            <p>The internal error handling has been improved. For
            example <span class="code">{error,Reason}</span> is always returned in case
            of errors even when the server dies.</p>
            <p><span class="code">app</span> and <span class="code">appup</span> files has been added as
            well as a corresponding test suite.</p>
            <p>Various cleanups has been made in the code and in the
            documentation.</p>

                In the new release of Reltool (0.5) there is a severe bug
                that may cause your source files to be deleted. The bug
                is triggered when you generate a target system WITH
                archive files AND your library directories are given with
                absolute paths. (Library directories are given with the
                ERL_LIBS environment variable or with the lib_dirs
                configuration parameter.)</p>

                Major improvements of the target system generation has
                been performed. Now it is possible to generate a
                relocatable target system that does not need to be
                re-installed if it is moved to a new location. Archive
                files are automatically generated. A detailed
                specification of the target system can be generated
                without actually creating the target system. Relocatable
                escripts are put in the bin directory of the target
                system. etc. etc.</p>

                relocatable</span>.</p>
              <p>
                Some parameters have been obsoleted and given new
