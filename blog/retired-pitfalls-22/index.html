        <p>Erlang/OTP 22 will bring many performance improvements to the table, but most
of them have a broad impact and don’t affect the way you write efficient code.
In this post I’d like to highlight a few things that used to be surprisingly
slow but no longer need to be avoided.</p>
      <h3 id="named-fun-recursion">
        
        
          Named fun recursion <a href="#named-fun-recursion">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>Named funs have a neat little feature that might not be obvious at a first
glance; their name is a variable like any other and you’re free to pass it to
another function or even return it.</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">deepfoldl(F, Acc0, L) -&gt;
    (fun NamedFun([_|_]=Elem, Acc) -&gt; lists:foldl(NamedFun, Acc, Elem);
         NamedFun([], Acc) -&gt; Acc;
         NamedFun(Elem, Acc) -&gt; F(Elem, Acc)
     end)(L, Acc0).
</code></pre>

<p>This is cool but a bit of a headache for the compiler. To create a fun we pass
its definition and free variables to a <code>make_fun2</code> instruction, but we can’t
include the fun itself as a free variable because it hasn’t been created yet.
Prior to OTP 22 we solved this by creating a new equivalent fun <em>inside</em> the
fun, but this made recursion surprisingly expensive both in terms of run-time
and memory use.</p>

<p>As of OTP 22 we translate recursion to a direct function call instead which
avoids creating a new fun. Other cases still require recreating the fun, but
they’re far less common.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/1973">Optimize named funs and fun-wrapped macros #1973</a></p>
      <h3 id="list-subtraction-with-large-operands--operator">
        
        
          List subtraction with large operands (– operator) <a href="#list-subtraction-with-large-operands--operator">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>While the Erlang VM appears to be pre-emptively scheduled to the programmer,
it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking#Cooperative_multitasking">co-operatively scheduled</a>
internally. When a native function runs it monopolizes the scheduler until it
returns, so a long-running one can severely harm the responsiveness of the
system. We’ve therefore written nearly all such functions in a style that
breaks the work into short units that complete quickly enough, but there’s
a steadily shrinking list of functions that misbehave, and list subtraction
was one of these.</p>

<p>It’s usually pretty straightforward to rewrite functions in this style, but
the <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/d9682b02b81fa6e23e554b6e017650eb89ecebed/erts/emulator/beam/erl_bif_lists.c#L195">old algorithm</a>
processed the second list in a loop around the first list, which is problematic
since both lists can be very long and resuming work in nested loops is often
trickier than expected.</p>

<p>In this case it was easier to just get rid of the nested loop altogether. The
new algorithm starts out by building a red-black tree from the right-hand side
before removing elements from the left-hand side. As all operations on the tree
have <code>log n</code> complexity we know that they will finish really quickly, so all we
need to care about is yielding in the outer loops.</p>

<p>This also had the nice side-effect of reducing the worst-case complexity from
<code>O(n²)</code> to <code>O(n log n)</code> and let us remove some warnings from the reference
manual and <a href="http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-10.1/doc/efficiency_guide/commoncaveats.html#operator-----">efficiency guide</a>. It’s worth noting
that the new implementation is always faster than the proposed workarounds, and
that it falls back to the old algorithm when it’s faster to do so.</p>

<p>This change will be rolled out in OTP 21.2, big thanks to
Dmytro Lytovchenko (@kvakvs on GitHub) for writing the better half of it!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/1998">Optimize list subtraction (A – B) and make it yield on large inputs #1998</a></p>
      <h3 id="lookahead-in-bit-syntax-matching">
        
        
          Lookahead in bit-syntax matching <a href="#lookahead-in-bit-syntax-matching">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>The optimization pass for bit-syntax matching was completely rewritten in OTP
22 to take advantage of the new SSA-based intermediate format. It applies the
same optimizations as before so already well-optimized code is unlikely to see
any benefit, but it manages to apply them in far more cases.</p>

<p>For those who aren’t familiar, all bit-syntax matching operates on a
<a href="/doc/efficiency_guide/binaryhandling.html#matching-binaries">“match context”</a>
internally, which is a mutable object that keeps track of the current
match position. This helps a lot when matching complicated patterns as it can
zip back and forth as required, saving us from having to match components more
than once.</p>

<p>This is great when matching several different patterns, but it comes in real
handy in loops like the following:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">trim_zero(&lt;&lt;0,Tail/binary&gt;&gt;) -&gt; trim_zero(Tail);
trim_zero(B) when is_binary(B) -&gt; B.
</code></pre>

<p>As the compiler can see that <code>Tail</code> is passed directly to <code>trim_zero</code>, which
promptly begins with a bit-match, it can skip extracting <code>Tail</code> as a sub-binary
and pass the match context instead. This is a pretty well-known optimization
called “match context reuse” which greatly improves performance when applied,
and a lot of code has been written with it in mind.</p>

<p>The catch of passing a match context like this is that we have to maintain the
illusion that we’re dealing with an immutable <em>binary</em>. Whenever it’s used in
a non-matching expression we either need to convert the context to an
equivalent binary, or admit defeat and skip the optimization.</p>

<p>While the compiler did a pretty good job prior to OTP 22 it gave up a bit too
easily in many cases, and the most trivial example is almost funny:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">calls_wrapper(&lt;&lt;"hello",Tail/binary&gt;&gt;) -&gt;
    count_ones(Tail).

%% This simple wrapper prevents context reuse in the call above. :(
count_ones(Bin) -&gt; count_ones_1(Bin, 0).

count_ones_1(&lt;&lt;1, Tail/binary&gt;&gt;, Acc) -&gt; count_ones_1(Tail, Acc + 1);
count_ones_1(&lt;&lt;_, Tail/binary&gt;&gt;, Acc) -&gt; count_ones_1(Tail, Acc);
count_ones_1(&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;, Acc) -&gt; Acc.
</code></pre>

<p>A trickier example can be found in the <code>string</code> module:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">bin_search_inv_1(&lt;&lt;CP1/utf8, BinRest/binary&gt;&gt;=Bin0, Cont, Sep) -&gt;
    case BinRest of
        %% 1
        &lt;&lt;CP2/utf8, _/binary&gt;&gt; when ?ASCII_LIST(CP1, CP2) -&gt;
            case CP1 of
                Sep -&gt;
                    %% 2
                    bin_search_inv_1(BinRest, Cont, Sep);
                _ -&gt;
                    %% 3
                    [Bin0|Cont]
            end;
        %% ... snip ...
</code></pre>

<p>What we’re looking at is a fast-path for ASCII characters; when both <code>CP1</code> and
<code>CP2</code> are ASCII we know that <code>CP1</code> is not a part of a grapheme cluster and we
can thus avoid a call to <code>unicode_util:gc/1</code>. It’s not a particularly expensive
function but calling it once per character adds up quickly.</p>

<p>At first glance it might seem safe to pass the context at <code>2</code>, but this is made
difficult by <code>Bin0</code> being returned at <code>3</code>. As contexts are mutable and change
their position whenever a match succeeds, naively converting <code>Bin0</code> back to a
binary would give you what comes after <code>CP2</code> instead.</p>

<p>Now, you might be wondering why we couldn’t simply restore the position before
converting <code>Bin0</code> back to a binary. It’s an obvious thing to do but before OTP
22 the context tracked not only the current position but also previous ones
needed when backtracking. These were saved in per-context “slots” which were
mutable and heavily reused, and the match at <code>1</code> clobbered the slot needed to
restore <code>Bin0</code>.</p>

<p>This also meant that a context couldn’t be used again after being passed to
another function or entering a <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code>, which made it more or less
impossible to apply this optimization in code that requires looking ahead.</p>

<p>As of OTP 22 these positions are stored outside the context so there’s no need
to worry about them becoming invalid, making it possible to optimize the above
cases.</p>
