        release_note: "*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***\n\nThe tracing support has been extended to allow a tracer module to be the trace event handler instead of a process or port. The tracer module makes it possible for trace tools to filter or manipulate trace event data without the trace event first having to be copied from the traced process or port.\n\nWith the introduction of this feature, erlang:trace(all|existing, _, _) now also returns the tracer process as part of the number of processes on which tracing is enabled. The is incompatible with the previous releases.\n\n"

        release_note: "Add microstate accounting\n\nMicrostate accounting is a way to track which state the different threads within ERTS are in. The main usage area is to pin point performance bottlenecks by checking which states the threads are in and then from there figuring out why and where to optimize.\n\nSince checking whether microstate accounting is on or off is relatively expensive only a few of the states are enabled by default and more states can be enabled through configure.\n\nThere is a convenience module called msacc that has been added to runtime_tools that can assist in gathering and interpreting the data from Microstate accounting.\n\nFor more information see erlang:statistics(microstate_accounting, _) and the msacc module in runtime_tools.\n\n"

        release_note: "Sharing preserved copy for messages and exit signals\n\nEnable sharing preserved copy with configure option --enable-sharing-preserving. This will preserve sharing, within the process, when communication with other processes in the Erlang node. There is a trade-off, the copy is more costly but this cost can be reclaimed if there is a lot of sharing in the message. In addition literals will not be copied in a send except during a purge phase of the module where the literals are located. This feature is considered experimental in 19.0.\n\n"

        release_note: "A new behaviour gen_statem has been implemented. It has been thoroughly reviewed, is stable enough to be used by at least two heavy OTP applications, and is here to stay. But depending on user feedback, we do not expect but might find it necessary to make minor not backwards compatible changes into OTP-20.0, so its state can be designated as \"not quite experimental\"...\n\nThe gen_statem behaviour is intended to replace gen_fsm for new code. It has the same features and add some really useful:\n\n-- State code is gathered\n\n-- The state can be any term\n\n-- Events can be postponed\n\n-- Events can be self generated\n\n-- A reply can be sent from a later state\n\n-- There can be multiple sys traceable replies\n\nThe callback model(s) for gen_statem differs from the one for gen_fsm, but it is still fairly easy to rewrite from gen_fsm to gen_statem.\n\n"

        release_note: "The erts internal tracing support has been changed to have much less overhead and be more scalable.\n\nThis rewrite does not break any backwards incompatibilities, but it does change the ordering of some trace messages when compared to previous releases. It should be noted that this only applies to trace messages sent to processes or ports, it does not apply to the new tracer module. However in future releases they may also be effected by this.\n\nTrace messages are only guaranteed to be ordered from one traced process or port. In previous releases this was not visible as a 'send' trace message would always arrive before the corresponding 'receive' trace message that is no longer always the case. This also means that timestamped trace messages may seem to arrive out of order as the timestamp is taken when the event is triggered and not when it is put in the queue of the tracer.\n\n"

The Erlang Parser still recognizes the is_subtype syntax, and will continue to do so for some time.\n\n"
        Applications: "stdlib"
      OTP-12719:
        release_note: "Background: In record fields with a type declaration but without an initializer, the Erlang parser inserted automatically the singleton type 'undefined' to the list of declared types, if that value was not present there. That is, the record declaration:\n\n-record(rec, {f1 :: float(), f2 = 42 :: integer(), f3 :: some_mod:some_typ()}).\n\nwas translated by the parser to:\n\n-record(rec, {f1 :: float() | 'undefined', f2 = 42 :: integer(), f3 :: some_mod:some_typ() | 'undefined'}).\n\nThe rationale for this was that creation of a \"dummy\" #rec{} record should not result in a warning from dialyzer that, for example, the implicit initialization of the #rec.f1 field violates its type declaration.\n\nProblems: This seemingly innocent action has some unforeseen consequences.\n\nFor starters, there is no way for programmers to declare that e.g. only floats make sense for the f1 field of #rec{} records when there is no \"obvious\" default initializer for this field. (This also affects tools like PropEr that use these declarations produced by the Erlang parser to generate random instances of records for testing purposes.)\n\nIt also means that dialyzer does not warn if e.g. an is_atom/1 test or something more exotic like an atom_to_list/1 call is performed on the value of the f1 field.\n\nSimilarly, there is no way to extend dialyzer to warn if it finds record constructions where f1 is not initialized to some float.\n\nLast but not least, it is semantically problematic when the type of the field is an opaque type: creating a union of an opaque and a structured type is very problematic for analysis because it fundamentally breaks the opacity of the term at that point.\n\nChange: To solve these problems the parser will not automatically insert the 'undefined' value anymore; instead the user has the option to choose the places where this value makes sense (for the field) and where it does not and insert the | 'undefined' there manually.\n\nConsequences of this change: This change means that dialyzer will issue a warning for all places where records with uninitialized fields are created and those fields have a declared type that is incompatible with 'undefined' (e.g. float()). This warning can be suppressed easily by adding | 'undefined' to the type of this field. This also adds documentation that the user really intends to create records where this field is uninitialized.\n\n"

        release_note: "The abstract data type in erl_syntax is augmented with types and function specifications.\n\nThe module erl_prettypr pretty prints types and function specification, and the output can be parsed.\n\nThe types of record fields are no longer ignored. As a consequence erl_syntax_lib:analyze_record_field/1 returns {Default, Type} instead of Default. The functions analyze_record_attribute, analyze_attribute, analyze_form, and analyze_forms in the erl_syntax_lib module are also affected by this incompatible change.\n\n"

      OTP-13088:
        release_note: "The functionality behind erlang:open_port/2 when called with spawn or spawn_executable has been redone so that the forking of the new program is done in a separate process called erl_child_setup. This allows for a much more robust implementation that uses less memory and does not block the entire emulator if the program to be started is on an un-accessible NFS. Benchmarks have shown this approach to be about 3-5 times as fast as the old approach where the fork/vfork was done by erts. This is a pure stability and performance fix, however some error messages may have changed, which is why it is marked as a backwards incompatible change.\n\n"
        Applications: "erts"
      OTP-13148:
        release_note: "Background: The types of record fields have since R12B been put in a separate form by epp:parse_file(), leaving the record declaration form untyped. The separate form, however, does not follow the syntax of type declarations, and parse transforms inspecting -type() attributes need to know about the special syntax. Since the compiler stores the return value of epp:parse_file() as debug information in the abstract code chunk (\"Abst\" or abstract_code), tools too need to know about the special syntax, if they inspect -type() attributes in abstract code.\n\nChange: No separate type form is created by epp:parse_file(), but the type information is kept in the record fields. This means that all parse transforms and all tools inspecting -record() declarations need to recognize {typed_record_field, Field, Type}.\n\n"

That is, the record declaration:\n\n-record(rec, {f1 :: float(), f2 = 42 :: integer(), f3 :: some_mod:some_typ()}).\n\nwas translated by the parser to:\n\n-record(rec, {f1 :: float() | 'undefined', f2 = 42 :: integer(), f3 :: some_mod:some_typ() | 'undefined'}).\n\nThe rationale for this was that creation of a \"dummy\" #rec{} record should not result in a warning from dialyzer that, for example, the implicit initialization of the #rec.f1 field violates its type declaration.\n\nProblems: This seemingly innocent action has some unforeseen consequences.\n\nFor starters, there is no way for programmers to declare that e.g. only floats make sense for the f1 field of #rec{} records when there is no \"obvious\" default initializer for this field. (This also affects tools like PropEr that use these declarations produced by the Erlang parser to generate random instances of records for testing purposes.)\n\nIt also means that dialyzer does not warn if e.g. an is_atom/1 test or something more exotic like an atom_to_list/1 call is performed on the value of the f1 field.\n\nSimilarly, there is no way to extend dialyzer to warn if it finds record constructions where f1 is not initialized to some float.\n\nLast but not least, it is semantically problematic when the type of the field is an opaque type: creating a union of an opaque and a structured type is very problematic for analysis because it fundamentally breaks the opacity of the term at that point.\n\nChange: To solve these problems the parser will not automatically insert the 'undefined' value anymore; instead the user has the option to choose the places where this value makes sense (for the field) and where it does not and insert the | 'undefined' there manually.\n\nConsequences of this change: This change means that dialyzer will issue a warning for all places where records with uninitialized fields are created and those fields have a declared type that is incompatible with 'undefined' (e.g. float()). This warning can be suppressed easily by adding | 'undefined' to the type of this field. This also adds documentation that the user really intends to create records where this field is uninitialized.\n\n"

Since the compiler stores the return value of epp:parse_file() as debug information in the abstract code chunk (\"Abst\" or abstract_code), tools too need to know about the special syntax, if they inspect -type() attributes in abstract code.\n\nChange: No separate type form is created by epp:parse_file(), but the type information is kept in the record fields. This means that all parse transforms and all tools inspecting -record() declarations need to recognize {typed_record_field, Field, Type}.\n\n"
