This module\nsupports reading most common tar formats, namely v7, STAR, USTAR, and PAX, as\nwell as some of GNU tar's extensions to the USTAR format (sparse files most\nnotably). It produces tar archives in USTAR format, unless the files being\narchived require PAX format due to restrictions in USTAR (such as unicode\nmetadata, filename length, and more). As such, `erl_tar` supports tar archives\nproduced by most all modern tar utilities, and produces tarballs which should be\nsimilarly portable.\n\nBy convention, the name of a tar file is to end in \"`.tar`\". To abide to the\nconvention, add \"`.tar`\" to the name.\n\nTar files can be created in one operation using function `create/2` or\n`create/3`.\n\nAlternatively, for more control, use functions `open/2`, [`add/3,4`](`add/3`),\nand `close/1`.\n\nTo extract all files from a tar file, use function `extract/1`. To extract only\nsome files or to be able to specify some more options, use function `extract/2`.\n\nTo return a list of the files in a tar file, use function `table/1` or\n`table/2`. To print a list of files to the Erlang shell, use function `t/1` or\n`tt/1`.\n\nTo convert an error term returned from one of the functions above to a readable\nmessage, use function `format_error/1`.","ref":"erl_tar.html"},{"type":"module","title":"Unicode Support - erl_tar","doc":"If `file:native_name_encoding/0` returns `utf8`, path names are encoded in UTF-8\nwhen creating tar files, and path names are assumed to be encoded in UTF-8 when\nextracting tar files.\n\nIf `file:native_name_encoding/0` returns `latin1`, no translation of path names\nis done.\n\nUnicode metadata stored in PAX headers is preserved","ref":"erl_tar.html#module-unicode-support"},{"type":"module","title":"Other Storage Media - erl_tar","doc":"The `m:ftp` module normally accesses the tar file on disk using the `m:file`\nmodule.

Most are provided\nthrough a [plug-in framework](#plug-in-framework)\nthat adds essential features to the base generators.\n\nPRNGs in general, and so the algorithms in this module, are mostly used\nfor test and simulation.  They are designed for good statistical\nquality and high generation speed.\n\nA generator algorithm, for each iteration, takes a state as input\nand produces a raw pseudo random number and a new state to be used\nfor the next iteration.\n\nA particular state always produces the same number and new state.\nThe initial state is produced from a [seed](`seed/1`).\nThis makes it possible to repeat for example a simulation with the same\nrandom number sequence, by re-using the same seed.\nThere are also the functions `export_seed/0` and `export_seed_s/1`\nthat capture the PRNG state in an `t:export_state/0`,\nthat can be used to start from a known state.\n\nThis property, and others, make the algorithms in this module\nunsuitable for cryptographical applications, but in the `m:crypto` module\nthere are suitable generators, for this module's\n[plug-in framework](#plug-in-framework).\nSee `crypto:rand_seed_s/0` and `crypto:rand_seed_alg_s/1`.\n\nAt the end of this module documentation there are some\n[niche algorithms](#niche-algorithms) that do not use\nthis module's normal [plug-in framework](#plug-in-framework).\nThey are useful for special purposes like fast generation\nwhen quality is not essential, for seeding other generators, and such.\n\n[](){: #plug-in-framework } Plug-in framework\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThe raw pseudo random numbers produced by the base generators\nare only appropriate in some cases such as power of two ranges\nless than the generator size, and some have quirks,\nfor example weak low bits.

This is done by one of the\n`seed/1` or `seed_s/1` functions, which also select which\n[algorithm](#algorithms) to use.  The `seed/1` functions\nstore the generator and state in the process dictionary,\nwhile the `seed_s/1` functions only return the state, which requires\nthe calling code to handle the state and updates to it.\n\nThe seed functions that do not have a `Seed` value as an argument\ncreate an automatic seed that should be unique to the created\ngenerator instance; see `seed_s/1`.\n\nIf an automatic seed is not desired, the seed functions that have a\n[`Seed`](`t:seed/0`) argument can be used.  The argument has\n3 possible formats; see the `t:seed/0` type description.\n\n[Plug-in framework API](#plug-in-framework-api) functions\nnamed with the suffix `_s` take an explicit state as the last argument\nand return the new state as the last element in the returned tuple.\nThe process dictionary is not used.\n\nSibling functions without that suffix take an implicit state from\nand store the new state in the process dictionary, and only return\ntheir \"interesting \" output value.  If the process dictionary\ndoes not contain a state, [`seed(default)`](`seed/1`)\nis implicitly called to create an automatic seed for the\n[_default algorithm_](#default-algorithm) as initial state.\n\n#### _Usage_\n\nFirst initialize a generator by calling one of the [seed](`seed/1`)\nfunctions, which also selects a PRNG algorithm.\n\nThen call a [Plug-in framework API](#plug-in-framework-api) function\neither with an explicit state from the seed function\nand use the returned new state in the next call,\nor call an API function without an explicit state argument\nto operate on the state in the process dictionary.\n\n#### _Shell Examples_\n\n```erlang\n%% Generate two uniformly distibuted floating point numbers.\n%%\n%% By not calling a [seed](`seed/1`) function, this uses\n%% the generator state and algorithm in the process dictionary.\n%% If there is no state there, [`seed(default)`](`seed/1`)\n%% is implicitly called first:\n%%\n1> R0 = rand:uniform(),\n   is_float(R0) andalso 0.0 =  R1 = rand:uniform(),\n   is_float(R1) andalso 0.0 =  K0 = rand:uniform(4711),\n   is_integer(K0) andalso 1 =  B0 = rand:bytes(16),\n   byte_size(B0) == 16.\ntrue\n\n%% Select and initialize a specified algorithm,\n%% with an automatic default seed, then generate\n%% a floating point number:\n%%\n5> rand:seed(exro928ss).\n6> R2 = rand:uniform(),\n   is_float(R2) andalso 0.0 =  rand:seed(exro928ss, 123456789).\n8> R3 = rand:uniform().\n0.48303622772415256\n\n%% Select and initialize a specific algorithm,\n%% with an automatic default seed, using the functional API\n%% with explicit generator state, then generate\n%% two floating point numbers.\n%%\n9>  S0 = rand:seed_s(exsss).\n10> {R4, S1} = rand:uniform_s(S0),\n    is_float(R4) andalso 0.0 =  {R5, S2} = rand:uniform_s(S1),\n    is_float(R5) andalso 0.0 =  {R4, _} = rand:uniform_s(S0).\n\n%% Generate a standard normal distribution number\n%% using the built-in fast Ziggurat Method:\n%%\n13> {SND0, S3} = rand:normal_s(S2),\n    is_float(SND0).\ntrue\n\n%% Generate a normal distribution number\n%% with mean -3 and variance 0.5:\n%%\n14> {ND0, S4} = rand:normal_s(-3, 0.5, S3),\n    is_float(ND0).\ntrue\n\n%% Generate a textbook basic form Box-Muller\n%% standard normal distribution number, which has the same\n%% distribution as the built-in Ziggurat method above,\n%% but is much slower:\n%%\n15> R6 = rand:uniform_real(),\n    is_float(R6) andalso 0.0   R7 = rand:uniform(),\n    is_float(R7) andalso 0.0 =  SND1 = math:sqrt(-2 * math:log(R6)) * math:cos(math:pi() * R7).\n\n%% Shuffle a deck of cards from a fixed seed,\n%% with a cryptographically unpredictable algorithm:\n18> Deck0 = [{Rank,Suit} ||\n     Rank <- lists:seq(2, 14),\n     Suit <- [clubs,diamonds,hearts,spades]]\n19> S5 = crypto:rand_seed_alg(crypto_aes, \"Nothing up my sleeve\")\n20> {Deck, S6} = rand:shuffle_s(Deck0, S5).\n21> Deck.\n[{2,spades},    {12,spades},   {14,diamonds}, {11,clubs},\n {6,spades},    {2,hearts},    {13,diamonds}, {12,hearts},\n {10,clubs},    {7,diamonds},  {2,diamonds},  {9,diamonds},\n {4,hearts},    {9,hearts},    {6,clubs},     {3,spades},\n {3,diamonds},  {14,clubs},    {9,spades},    {10,hearts},\n {3,hearts},    {4,spades},    {13,hearts},   {5,hearts},\n {7,hearts},    {7,clubs},     {8,spades},    {14,spades},\n {11,spades},   {12,clubs},    {5,diamonds},  {12,diamonds},\n {4,diamonds},  {9,clubs},     {14,hearts},   {2,clubs},\n {10,diamonds}, {13,spades},   {6,hearts},    {4,clubs},\n {7,spades},    {5,spades},    {10,spades},   {5,clubs},\n {8,diamonds},  {6,diamonds},  {8,clubs},     {11,hearts},\n {13,clubs},    {11,diamonds}, {3,clubs},     {8,hearts}]\n```\n\n[](){: #algorithms } Algorithms\n-------------------------------\n\nThe base generator algorithms implement the\n[Xoroshiro and Xorshift algorithms](http://xorshift.di.unimi.it)\nby Sebastiano Vigna.  During an iteration they generate an integer\n(at least 58-bit) and operate on a state of several integers.\nThe size of these integers is chosen to not require bignum arithmetic\non 64-bit platforms, which facilitates fast integer operations,\nin particular when handled by the JIT VM.\n\nFor most algorithms, jump functions are provided for generating\nnon-overlapping sequences. A jump function perform a calculation\nequivalent to a large number of repeated state iterations,\nbut execute in a time roughly equivalent to one regular iteration\nper generator bit.\n\nBy using a jump function instead of starting several generators\nfrom different seeds it is assured that the generated sequences\ndo not overlap.  The alternative of using different seeds\nmay accidentally start the generators in sequence positions\nthat are close to each other, but a jump function jumps\nto a sequence position very far ahead.\n\nTo create numbers with normal distribution the\n[Ziggurat Method by Marsaglia and Tsang](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v05/i08)\nis used on the output from a base generator.\n\nThe following algorithms are provided:\n\n- **`exsss`**, the [_default algorithm_](#default-algorithm)\n  *(Since OTP 22.0)*  \n  Xorshift116\\*\\*, 58 bits precision and period of 2^116-1.\n\n  Jump function: equivalent to 2^64 calls.\n\n  This is the Xorshift116 generator combined with the StarStar scrambler from\n  the 2018 paper by David Blackman and Sebastiano Vigna:\n  [Scrambled Linear Pseudorandom Number Generators](http://vigna.di.unimi.it/ftp/papers/ScrambledLinear.pdf)\n\n  The generator does not use 58-bit rotates so it is faster than the\n  Xoroshiro116 generator, and when combined with the StarStar scrambler\n  it does not have any weak low bits like `exrop` (Xoroshiro116+).\n\n  Alas, this combination is about 10% slower than `exrop`, but despite that\n  it is the [_default algorithm_](#default-algorithm) thanks to\n  its statistical qualities.\n\n- **`exro928ss`** *(Since OTP 22.0)*  \n  Xoroshiro928\\*\\*, 58 bits precision and a period of 2^928-1.\n\n  Jump function: equivalent to 2^512 calls.\n\n  This is a 58 bit version of Xoroshiro1024\\*\\*, from the 2018 paper by\n  David Blackman and Sebastiano Vigna:\n  [Scrambled Linear Pseudorandom Number Generators](http://vigna.di.unimi.it/ftp/papers/ScrambledLinear.pdf)\n  that on a 64 bit Erlang system executes only about 40% slower than the\n  [*default `exsss` algorithm*](#default-algorithm)\n  but with much longer period and better statistical properties,\n  but on the flip side a larger state.\n\n  Many thanks to Sebastiano Vigna for his help with the 58 bit adaption.\n\n- **`exrop`** *(Since OTP 20.0)*  \n  Xoroshiro116+, 58 bits precision and period of 2^116-1.\n\n  Jump function: equivalent to 2^64 calls.\n\n- **`exs1024s`** *(Since OTP 20.0)*  \n  Xorshift1024\\*, 64 bits precision and a period of 2^1024-1\n\n  Jump function: equivalent to 2^512 calls.\n\n  Since this generator operates on 64-bit integers that are bignums\n  on 64 bit platforms, it is much slower than `exro928ss` above.\n\n- **`exsp`** *(Since OTP 20.0)*  \n  Xorshift116+, 58 bits precision and period of 2^116-1\n\n  Jump function: equivalent to 2^64 calls.\n\n  This is a corrected version of a previous\n  [_default algorithm_](#default-algorithm) (`exsplus`, _deprecated_),\n  that was superseded by Xoroshiro116+ (`exrop`).  Since this algorithm\n  does not use rotate operations it executes a little (say < 15%) faster\n  than `exrop` (that has to do a 58 bit rotate,\n  for which there is no native instruction).\n  See the [algorithms' homepage](http://xorshift.di.unimi.it).\n\n[](){: #default-algorithm }\n#### Default Algorithm\n\nThe current _default algorithm_ is\n[`exsss` (Xorshift116\\*\\*)](#algorithms). If a specific algorithm is\nrequired, ensure to always use `seed/1` to initialize the state.\n\nIn many API functions in this module, the atom `default` can be used\ninstead of an algorithm name, and is currently an alias for `exsss`.\nIn a future Erlang/OTP release this might be a different algorithm.\nThe _default algorithm_ is selected to be one with high speed,\nsmall state and \"good enough\" statistical properties.\n\nIf it is essential to reproduce the same PRNG sequence\non a later Erlang/OTP release, use `seed/2` or `seed_s/2`\nto select *both* a specific algorithm and the seed value.\n\n#### Old Algorithms\n\nUndocumented (old) algorithms are deprecated but still implemented so old code\nrelying on them will produce the same pseudo random sequences as before.\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> There were a number of problems in the implementation of\n> the now undocumented algorithms, which is why they are deprecated.\n> The new algorithms are a bit slower but do not have these problems:\n>\n> Uniform integer ranges had a skew in the probability distribution\n> that was not noticeable for small ranges but for large ranges\n> less than the generator's precision the probability to produce\n> a low number could be twice the probability for a high.\n>\n> Uniform integer ranges larger than or equal to the generator's precision\n> used a floating point fallback that only calculated with 52 bits\n> which is smaller than the requested range and therefore all numbers\n> in the requested range were not even possible to produce.\n>\n> Uniform floats had a non-uniform density so small values for example\n> less than 0.5 had got smaller intervals decreasing as the generated value\n> approached 0.0 although still uniformly distributed for sufficiently large\n> subranges. The new algorithms produces uniformly distributed floats\n> of the form `N * 2.0^(-53)` hence they are equally spaced.\n\n#### Quality of the Generated Numbers\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> The builtin random number generator algorithms are not cryptographically\n> strong. If a cryptographically strong random number generator is needed,\n> use for example `crypto:rand_seed_s/0` or `crypto:rand_seed_alg_s/1`.\n\nFor all these generators except `exro928ss` and `exsss` the lowest bit(s)\nhave got a slightly less random behaviour than all other bits.\n1 bit for `exrop` (and `exsp`), and 3 bits for `exs1024s`. See for example\nthis explanation in the\n[Xoroshiro128+](http://xoroshiro.di.unimi.it/xoroshiro128plus.c)\ngenerator source code:\n\n> Beside passing BigCrush, this generator passes the PractRand test suite\n> up to (and included) 16TB, with the exception of binary rank tests,\n> which fail due to the lowest bit being an LFSR; all other bits pass all\n> tests. We suggest to use a sign test to extract a random Boolean value.\n\nIf this is a problem; to generate a boolean with these algorithms,\nuse something like this:\n\n```erlang\n(rand:uniform(256) > 128) % -> boolean()\n```\n\n```erlang\n((rand:uniform(256) - 1) bsr 7) % -> 0 | 1\n```\n\nFor a general range, with `N = 1` for `exrop`, and `N = 3` for `exs1024s`:\n\n```erlang\n(((rand:uniform(Range bsl N) - 1) bsr N) + 1)\n```\n\nThe floating point generating functions in this module waste the lowest bits\nwhen converting from an integer so they avoid this snag.\n\n\n[](){: #niche-algorithms } Niche algorithms\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThe [niche algorithms API](#niche-algorithms-api) contains\nspecial purpose algorithms that do not use the\n[plug-in framework](#plug-in-framework), mainly for performance reasons.\n\nSince these algorithms lack the plug-in framework support, generating numbers\nin a range other than the base generator's range may become a problem.\n\nThere are at least four ways to do this, assuming the `Range` is less than\nthe generator's range:\n\n[](){: #modulo-method }\n- **Modulo**  \n  To generate a number `V` in the range `0 .. Range-1`:\n\n  > Generate a number `X`.  \n  > Use `V = X rem Range` as your value.\n\n  This method uses `rem`, that is, the remainder of an integer division,\n  which is a slow operation.\n\n  Low bits from the generator propagate straight through to\n  the generated value, so if the generator has got weaknesses\n  in the low bits this method propagates them too.\n\n  If `Range` is not a divisor of the generator range, the generated numbers\n  have a bias.  Example:\n\n  Say the generator generates a byte, that is, the generator range\n  is `0 .. 255`, and the desired range is `0 .. 99` (`Range = 100`).\n  Then there are 3 generator outputs that produce the value `0`,\n  these are `0`, `100` and `200`.\n  But there are only 2 generator outputs that produce the value `99`,\n  which are `99` and `199`. So the probability for a value `V` in `0 .. 55`\n  is 3/2 times the probability for the other values `56 .. 99`.\n\n  If `Range` is much smaller than the generator range, then this bias\n  gets hard to detect. The rule of thumb is that if `Range` is smaller\n  than the square root of the generator range, the bias is small enough.\n  Example:\n\n  A byte generator when `Range = 20`. There are 12 (`256 div 20`)\n  possibilities to generate the highest numbers and one more to generate\n  a number `V < 16` (`256 rem 20`). So the probability is 13/12\n  for a low number versus a high. To detect that difference with\n  some confidence you would need to generate a lot more numbers\n  than the generator range, `256` in this small example.\n\n[](){: #truncated-multiplication-method }\n- **Truncated multiplication**  \n  To generate a number `V` in the range `0 .. Range-1`, when you have\n  a generator with a power of 2 range (`0 .. 2^Bits-1`):\n\n  > Generate a number `X`.  \n  > Use `V = X * Range bsr Bits` as your value.\n\n  If the multiplication `X * Range` creates a bignum\n  this method becomes very slow.\n\n  High bits from the generator propagate through to the generated value,\n  so if the generator has got weaknesses in the high bits this method\n  propagates them too.\n\n  If `Range` is not a divisor of the generator range, the generated numbers\n  have a bias, pretty much as for the [Modulo](#modulo-method) method above.\n\n[](){: #shift-or-mask-method }\n- **Shift or mask**  \n  To generate a number in a power of 2 range (`0 .. 2^RBits-1`),\n  when you have a generator with a power of 2 range (`0 .. 2^Bits`):\n\n  > Generate a number `X`.  \n  > Use `V = X band ((1 bsl RBits)-1)` or `V = X bsr (Bits-RBits)`\n  > as your value.\n\n  Masking with `band` preserves the low bits, and right shifting\n  with `bsr` preserves the high, so if the generator has got weaknesses\n  in high or low bits; choose the right operator.\n\n  If the generator has got a range that is not a power of 2\n  and this method is used anyway, it introduces bias in the same way\n  as for the [Modulo](#modulo-method) method above.\n\n[](){: #rejection-method }\n- **Rejection**  \n\n  > Generate a number `X`.  \n  > If `X` is in the range, use it as your value,\n  > otherwise reject it and repeat.\n\n  In theory it is not certain that this method will ever complete,\n  but in practice you ensure that the probability of rejection is low.\n  Then the probability for yet another iteration decreases exponentially\n  so the expected mean number of iterations will often be between 1 and 2.\n  Also, since the base generator is a full length generator,\n  a value that will break the loop must eventually be generated.\n\nThese methods can be combined, such as using\nthe [Modulo](#modulo-method) method and only if the generator value\nwould create bias use [Rejection](#rejection-method).\nOr using [Shift or mask](#shift-or-mask-method) to reduce the size\nof a generator value so that\n[Truncated multiplication](#truncated-multiplication-method)\nwill not create a bignum.\n\nThe recommended way to generate a floating point number\n(IEEE 745 Double, that has got a 53-bit mantissa) in the range\n`0 .. 1`, that is `0.0 =< V < 1.0` is to generate a 53-bit number `X`\nand then use `V = X * (1.0/((1 bsl 53)))` as your value.\nThis will create a value of the form N*2^-53 with equal probability\nfor every possible N for the range.","ref":"rand.html"},{"type":"type","title":"rand.alg/0","doc":"","ref":"rand.html#t:alg/0"},{"type":"type","title":"rand.alg_handler/0","doc":"","ref":"rand.html#t:alg_handler/0"},{"type":"type","title":"rand.alg_state/0","doc":"","ref":"rand.html#t:alg_state/0"},{"type":"type","title":"rand.builtin_alg/0","doc":"","ref":"rand.html#t:builtin_alg/0"},{"type":"function","title":"rand.bytes/1","doc":"Generate random bytes as a `t:binary()`,\nusing the state in the process dictionary.\n\nLike `bytes_s/2` but operates on the state stored in\nthe process dictionary.

They are also available as [`table/1,2`](`table/1`), to resemble the\n  `m:erl_tar` module.\n- To print a list of files to the Erlang shell, use function `t/1` or `tt/1`.\n- Sometimes it is desirable to open a zip archive, and to unzip files from it\n  file by file, without having to reopen the archive. This can be done by\n  functions [`zip_open/1,2`](`zip_open/1`), [`zip_get/1,2`](`zip_get/1`),\n  `zip_list_dir/1`, and `zip_close/1`.\n- The ZIP extensions 0x5355 \"extended timestamps\" and 0x7875 \"UID+GID handling\"\n  are supported.

It also provides the\nback end for the same functions when called from the Erlang shell.\n\nThe translation from funs to match specifications is accessed through the two\n\"pseudo functions\" `ets:fun2ms/1` and `dbg:fun2ms/1`.\n\nAs everyone trying to use [`ets:select/2`](`ets:select/1`) or `m:dbg` seems to\nend up reading this manual page, this description is an introduction to the\nconcept of match specifications.\n\nRead the whole manual page if it is the first time you are using the\ntransformations.\n\nMatch specifications are used more or less as filters. They resemble usual\nErlang matching in a list comprehension or in a fun used with `lists:foldl/3`,\nand so on. However, the syntax of pure match specifications is awkward, as they\nare made up purely by Erlang terms, and the language has no syntax to make the\nmatch specifications more readable.\n\nAs the execution and structure of the match specifications are like that of a\nfun, it is more straightforward to write it using the familiar fun syntax and to\nhave that translated into a match specification automatically. A real fun is\nclearly more powerful than the match specifications allow, but bearing the match\nspecifications in mind, and what they can do, it is still more convenient to\nwrite it all as a fun. This module contains the code that translates the fun\nsyntax into match specification terms.","ref":"ms_transform.html"},{"type":"module","title":"Example 1 - ms_transform","doc":"Using `ets:select/2` and a match specification, one can filter out rows of a\ntable and construct a list of tuples containing relevant parts of the data in\nthese rows. One can use `ets:foldl/3` instead, but the `ets:select/2` call is\nfar more efficient. Without the translation provided by `ms_transform`, one must\nstruggle with writing match specifications terms to accommodate this.\n\nConsider a simple table of employees:\n\n```erlang\n-record(emp, {empno,     %Employee number as a string, the key\n              surname,   %Surname of the employee\n              givenname, %Given name of employee\n              dept,      %Department, one of {dev,sales,prod,adm}\n              empyear}). %Year the employee was employed\n```\n\nWe create the table using:\n\n```text\nets:new(emp_tab, [{keypos,#emp.empno},named_table,ordered_set]).\n```\n\nWe fill the table with randomly chosen data:\n\n```erlang\n[{emp,\"011103\",\"Black\",\"Alfred\",sales,2000},\n {emp,\"041231\",\"Doe\",\"John\",prod,2001},\n {emp,\"052341\",\"Smith\",\"John\",dev,1997},\n {emp,\"076324\",\"Smith\",\"Ella\",sales,1995},\n {emp,\"122334\",\"Weston\",\"Anna\",prod,2002},\n {emp,\"535216\",\"Chalker\",\"Samuel\",adm,1998},\n {emp,\"789789\",\"Harrysson\",\"Joe\",adm,1996},\n {emp,\"963721\",\"Scott\",\"Juliana\",dev,2003},\n {emp,\"989891\",\"Brown\",\"Gabriel\",prod,1999}]\n```\n\nAssuming that we want the employee numbers of everyone in the sales department,\nthere are several ways.\n\n`ets:match/2` can be used:\n\n```erlang\n1> ets:match(emp_tab, {'_', '$1', '_', '_', sales, '_'}).\n[[\"011103\"],[\"076324\"]]\n```\n\n`ets:match/2` uses a simpler type of match specification, but it is still\nunreadable, and one has little control over the returned result. It is always a\nlist of lists.\n\n`ets:foldl/3` or `ets:foldr/3` can be used to avoid the nested lists:\n\n```erlang\nets:foldr(fun(#emp{empno = E, dept = sales},Acc) -> [E | Acc];\n             (_,Acc) -> Acc\n          end,\n          [],\n          emp_tab).\n```\n\nThe result is `[\"011103\",\"076324\"]`. The fun is straightforward, so the only\nproblem is that all the data from the table must be transferred from the table\nto the calling process for filtering. That is inefficient compared to the\n`ets:match/2` call where the filtering can be done \"inside\" the emulator and\nonly the result is transferred to the process.\n\nConsider a \"pure\" `ets:select/2` call that does what `ets:foldr` does:\n\n```erlang\nets:select(emp_tab, [{#emp{empno = '$1', dept = sales, _='_'},[],['$1']}]).\n```\n\nAlthough the record syntax is used, it is still hard to read and even harder to\nwrite. The first element of the tuple,\n`#emp{empno = '$1', dept = sales, _='_'}`, tells what to match. Elements not\nmatching this are not returned, as in the `ets:match/2` example. The second\nelement, the empty list, is a list of guard expressions, which we do not need.\nThe third element is the list of expressions constructing the return value (in\nETS this is almost always a list containing one single term). In our case `'$1'`\nis bound to the employee number in the head (first element of the tuple), and\nhence the employee number is returned. The result is `[\"011103\",\"076324\"]`, as\nin the `ets:foldr/3` example, but the result is retrieved much more efficiently\nin terms of execution speed and memory consumption.\n\nUsing `ets:fun2ms/1`, we can combine the ease of use of the `ets:foldr/3` and\nthe efficiency of the pure `ets:select/2` example:\n\n```erlang\n-include_lib(\"stdlib/include/ms_transform.hrl\").\n\nets:select(emp_tab, ets:fun2ms(\n                      fun(#emp{empno = E, dept = sales}) ->\n                              E\n                      end)).\n```\n\nThis example requires no special knowledge of match specifications to\nunderstand. The head of the fun matches what you want to filter out and the body\nreturns what you want returned. As long as the fun can be kept within the limits\nof the match specifications, there is no need to transfer all table data to the\nprocess for filtering as in the `ets:foldr/3` example. It is easier to read than\nthe `ets:foldr/3` example, as the select call in itself discards anything that\ndoes not match, while the fun of the `ets:foldr/3` call needs to handle both the\nelements matching and the ones not matching.\n\nIn the `ets:fun2ms/1` example above, it is needed to include `ms_transform.hrl`\nin the source code, as this is what triggers the parse transformation of the\n`ets:fun2ms/1` call to a valid match specification. This also implies that the\ntransformation is done at compile time (except when called from the shell) and\ntherefore takes no resources in runtime.

A simple answer is: see the documentation of\n[match specifications](`e:erts:match_spec.md`) in ERTS User's Guide. However,\nthe following is a brief overview of the most useful \"built-in functions\" that\nyou can use when the fun is to be translated into a match specification by\n`ets:fun2ms/1`. It is not possible to call other functions than those allowed in\nmatch specifications. No \"usual\" Erlang code can be executed by the fun that is\ntranslated by `ets:fun2ms/1`. The fun is limited exactly to the power of the\nmatch specifications, which is unfortunate, but the price one must pay for the\nexecution speed of `ets:select/2` compared to `ets:foldl/foldr`.\n\nThe head of the fun is a head matching (or mismatching) _one_ parameter, one\nobject of the table we select from. The object is always a single variable (can\nbe `_`) or a tuple, as ETS, Dets, and Mnesia tables include that. The match\nspecification returned by `ets:fun2ms/1` can be used with `dets:select/2` and\n`mnesia:select/2`, and with `ets:select/2`. The use of `=` in the head is\nallowed (and encouraged) at the top-level.\n\nThe guard section can contain any guard expression of Erlang. The following is a\nlist of BIFs and expressions:\n\n- Type tests: `is_atom`, `is_float`, `is_integer`, `is_list`, `is_number`,\n  `is_pid`, `is_port`, `is_reference`, `is_tuple`, `is_binary`, `is_function`,\n  `is_record`\n- Boolean operators: `not`, `and`, `or`, `andalso`, `orelse`\n- Relational operators: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `=<`, `=:=`, `==`, `=/=`, `/=`\n- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `div`, `rem`\n- Bitwise operators: `band`, `bor`, `bxor`, `bnot`, `bsl`, `bsr`\n- The guard BIFs: `abs`, `element`, `hd`, `length`, `node`, `round`, `size`,\n  `byte_size`, `tl`, `trunc`, `binary_part`, `self`\n\nContrary to the fact with \"handwritten\" match specifications, the `is_record`\nguard works as in ordinary Erlang code.\n\nSemicolons (`;`) in guards are allowed, the result is (as expected) one \"match\nspecification clause\" for each semicolon-separated part of the guard. The\nsemantics is identical to the Erlang semantics.\n\nThe body of the fun is used to construct the resulting value. When selecting\nfrom tables, one usually construct a suiting term here, using ordinary Erlang\nterm construction, like tuple parentheses, list brackets, and variables matched\nout in the head, possibly with the occasional constant. Whatever expressions are\nallowed in guards are also allowed here, but no special functions exist except\n`object` and `bindings` (see further down), which returns the whole matched\nobject and all known variable bindings, respectively.\n\nThe `dbg` variants of match specifications have an imperative approach to the\nmatch specification body, the ETS dialect has not. The fun body for\n`ets:fun2ms/1` returns the result without side effects. As matching (`=`) in the\nbody of the match specifications is not allowed (for performance reasons) the\nonly thing left, more or less, is term construction.","ref":"ms_transform.html#module-useful-bifs"},{"type":"module","title":"Example with dbg - ms_transform","doc":"This section describes the slightly different match specifications translated by\n`dbg:fun2ms/1`.\n\nThe same reasons for using the parse transformation apply to `dbg`, maybe even\nmore, as filtering using Erlang code is not a good idea when tracing (except\nafterwards, if you trace to file). The concept is similar to that of\n`ets:fun2ms/1` except that you usually use it directly from the shell (which can\nalso be done with `ets:fun2ms/1`).\n\nThe following is an example module to trace on:\n\n```erlang\n-module(toy).\n\n-export([start/1, store/2, retrieve/1]).\n\nstart(Args) ->\n    toy_table = ets:new(toy_table, Args).\n\nstore(Key, Value) ->\n    ets:insert(toy_table, {Key,Value}).\n\nretrieve(Key) ->\n    [{Key, Value}] = ets:lookup(toy_table, Key),\n    Value.\n```\n\nDuring model testing, the first test results in `{badmatch,16}` in\n`{toy,start,1}`, why?\n\nWe suspect the `ets:new/2` call, as we match hard on the return value, but want\nonly the particular `new/2` call with `toy_table` as first parameter. So we\nstart a default tracer on the node:\n\n```text\n1> dbg:tracer().\n{ok,<0.88.0>}\n```\n\nWe turn on call tracing for all processes, we want to make a pretty restrictive\ntrace pattern, so there is no need to call trace only a few processes (usually\nit is not):\n\n```text\n2> dbg:p(all,call).\n{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,25}]}\n```\n\nWe specify the filter, we want to view calls that resemble\n`ets:new(toy_table,  )`:\n\n```erlang\n3> dbg:tp(ets,new,dbg:fun2ms(fun([toy_table,_]) -> true end)).\n{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,1},{saved,1}]}\n```\n\nAs can be seen, the fun used with `dbg:fun2ms/1` takes a single list as\nparameter instead of a single tuple. The list matches a list of the parameters\nto the traced function. A single variable can also be used. The body of the fun\nexpresses, in a more imperative way, actions to be taken if the fun head (and\nthe guards) matches. `true` is returned here, only because the body of a fun\ncannot be empty. The return value is discarded.\n\nThe following trace output is received during test:\n\n```erlang\n(<0.86.0>) call ets:new(toy_table, [ordered_set])\n```\n\nAssume that we have not found the problem yet, and want to see what `ets:new/2`\nreturns. We use a slightly different trace pattern:\n\n```erlang\n4> dbg:tp(ets,new,dbg:fun2ms(fun([toy_table,_]) -> return_trace() end)).\n```\n\nThe following trace output is received during test:\n\n```erlang\n(<0.86.0>) call ets:new(toy_table,[ordered_set])\n(<0.86.0>) returned from ets:new/2 -> 24\n```\n\nThe call to `return_trace` results in a trace message when the function returns.\nIt applies only to the specific function call triggering the match specification\n(and matching the head/guards of the match specification). This is by far the\nmost common call in the body of a `dbg` match specification.\n\nThe test now fails with `{badmatch,24}` because the atom `toy_table` does not\nmatch the number returned for an unnamed table. So, the problem is found, the\ntable is to be named, and the arguments supplied by the test program do not\ninclude `named_table`. We rewrite the start function:\n\n```erlang\nstart(Args) ->\n    toy_table = ets:new(toy_table, [named_table|Args]).\n```\n\nWith the same tracing turned on, the following trace output is received:\n\n```erlang\n(<0.86.0>) call ets:new(toy_table,[named_table,ordered_set])\n(<0.86.0>) returned from ets:new/2 -> toy_table\n```\n\nAssume that the module now passes all testing and goes into the system. After a\nwhile, it is found that table `toy_table` grows while the system is running and\nthat there are many elements with atoms as keys. We expected only integer keys\nand so does the rest of the system, but clearly not the entire system. We turn\non call tracing and try to see calls to the module with an atom as the key:\n\n```erlang\n1> dbg:tracer().\n{ok,<0.88.0>}\n2> dbg:p(all,call).\n{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,25}]}\n3> dbg:tpl(toy,store,dbg:fun2ms(fun([A,_]) when is_atom(A) -> true end)).\n{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,1},{saved,1}]}\n```\n\nWe use `dbg:tpl/3` to ensure to catch local calls (assume that the module has\ngrown since the smaller version and we are unsure if this inserting of atoms is\nnot done locally). When in doubt, always use local call tracing.\n\nAssume that nothing happens when tracing in this way. The function is never\ncalled with these parameters. We conclude that someone else (some other module)\nis doing it and realize that we must trace on `ets:insert/2` and want to see the\ncalling function. The calling function can be retrieved using the match\nspecification function `caller`. To get it into the trace message, the match\nspecification function `message` must be used. The filter call looks like this\n(looking for calls to `ets:insert/2`):\n\n```erlang\n4> dbg:tpl(ets,insert,dbg:fun2ms(fun([toy_table,{A,_}]) when is_atom(A) ->\n                                    message(caller())\n                                  end)).\n{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,1},{saved,2}]}\n```\n\nThe caller is now displayed in the \"additional message\" part of the trace\noutput, and the following is displayed after a while:\n\n```erlang\n(<0.86.0>) call ets:insert(toy_table,{garbage,can}) ({evil_mod,evil_fun,2})\n```\n\nYou have realized that function `evil_fun` of the `evil_mod` module, with arity\n`2`, is causing all this trouble.\n\nThis example illustrates the most used calls in match specifications for `dbg`.\nThe other, more esoteric, calls are listed and explained in\n[Match specifications in Erlang](`e:erts:match_spec.md`) in ERTS User's Guide,\nas they are beyond the scope of this description.","ref":"ms_transform.html#module-example-with-dbg"},{"type":"module","title":"Warnings and Restrictions - ms_transform","doc":"[](){: #warnings_and_restrictions }\n\nThe following warnings and restrictions apply to the funs used in with\n`ets:fun2ms/1` and `dbg:fun2ms/1`.\n\n> #### Warning {: .warning }\n>\n> To use the pseudo functions triggering the translation, ensure to include the\n> header file `ms_transform.hrl` in the source code.

The latter results in a\n> compile-time error if the header is included, otherwise a runtime error.\n\nMany restrictions apply to the fun that is translated into a match\nspecification. To put it simple: you cannot use anything in the fun that you\ncannot use in a match specification. This means that, among others, the\nfollowing restrictions apply to the fun itself:\n\n- Functions written in Erlang cannot be called, neither can local functions,\n  global functions, or real funs.\n- Everything that is written as a function call is translated into a match\n  specification call to a built-in function, so that the call\n  [`is_list(X)`](`is_list/1`) is translated to `{'is_list', '$1'}` (`'$1'` is\n  only an example, the numbering can vary). If one tries to call a function that\n  is not a match specification built-in, it causes an error.\n- Variables occurring in the head of the fun are replaced by match specification\n  variables in the order of occurrence, so that fragment `fun({A,B,C})` is\n  replaced by `{'$1', '$2', '$3'}`, and so on. Every occurrence of such a\n  variable in the match specification is replaced by a match specification\n  variable in the same way, so that the fun\n  `fun({A,B}) when is_atom(A) -> B end` is translated into\n  `[{{'$1','$2'},[{is_atom,'$1'}],['$2']}]`.\n- Variables that are not included in the head are imported from the environment\n  and made into match specification `const` expressions. Example from the shell:\n\n  ```erlang\n  1> X = 25.\n  25\n  2> ets:fun2ms(fun({A,B}) when A > X -> B end).\n  [{{'$1','$2'},[{'>','$1',{const,25}}],['$2']}]\n  ```\n\n- Matching with `=` cannot be used in the body. It can only be used on the\n  top-level in the head of the fun. Example from the shell again:\n\n  ```erlang\n  1> ets:fun2ms(fun({A,[B|C]} = D) when A > B -> D end).\n  [{{'$1',['$2'|'$3']},[{'>','$1','$2'}],['$_']}]\n  2> ets:fun2ms(fun({A,[B|C]=D}) when A > B -> D end).\n  Error: fun with head matching ('=' in head) cannot be translated into\n  match_spec\n  {error,transform_error}\n  3> ets:fun2ms(fun({A,[B|C]}) when A > B -> D = [B|C], D end).\n  Error: fun with body matching ('=' in body) is illegal as match_spec\n  {error,transform_error}\n  ```\n\n  All variables are bound in the head of a match specification, so the\n  translator cannot allow multiple bindings. The special case when matching is\n  done on the top-level makes the variable bind to `'$_'` in the resulting match\n  specification. It is to allow a more natural access to the whole matched\n  object. Pseudo function `object()` can be used instead, see below.\n\n  The following expressions are translated equally:\n\n  ```erlang\n  ets:fun2ms(fun({a,_} = A) -> A end).\n  ets:fun2ms(fun({a,_}) -> object() end).\n  ```\n\n- The special match specification variables `'$_'` and `'$*'` can be accessed\n  through the pseudo functions `object()` (for `'$_'`) and `bindings()` (for\n  `'$*'`). As an example, one can translate the following `ets:match_object/2`\n  call to a `ets:select/2` call:\n\n  ```erlang\n  ets:match_object(Table, {'$1',test,'$2'}).\n  ```\n\n  This is the same as:\n\n  ```erlang\n  ets:select(Table, ets:fun2ms(fun({A,test,B}) -> object() end)).\n  ```\n\n  In this simple case, the former expression is probably preferable in terms of\n  readability.\n\n  The `ets:select/2` call conceptually looks like this in the resulting code:\n\n  ```erlang\n  ets:select(Table, [{{'$1',test,'$2'},[],['$_']}]).\n  ```\n\n  Matching on the top-level of the fun head can be a more natural way to access\n  `'$_'`, see above.\n\n- Term constructions/literals are translated as much as is needed to get them\n  into valid match specification. This way tuples are made into match\n  specification tuple constructions (a one element tuple containing the tuple)\n  and constant expressions are used when importing variables from the\n  environment. Records are also translated into plain tuple constructions, calls\n  to element, and so on. The guard test [`is_record/2`](`is_record/2`) is\n  translated into match specification code using the three parameter version\n  that is built into match specification, so that\n  [`is_record(A,t)`](`is_record/2`) is translated into `{is_record,'$1',t,5}` if\n  the record size of record type `t` is 5.\n- Language constructions such as `case`, `if`, and `catch` that are not present\n  in match specifications are not allowed.\n- If header file `ms_transform.hrl` is not included, the fun is not translated,\n  which can result in a _runtime error_ (depending on whether the fun is valid\n  in a pure Erlang context).\n\n  Ensure that the header is included when using `ets` and `dbg:fun2ms/1` in\n  compiled code.\n\n- If pseudo function triggering the translation is `ets:fun2ms/1`, the head of\n  the fun must contain a single variable or a single tuple. If the pseudo\n  function is `dbg:fun2ms/1`, the head of the fun must contain a single variable\n  or a single list.\n\nThe translation from funs to match specifications is done at compile time, so\nruntime performance is not affected by using these pseudo functions.\n\nFor more information about match specifications, see the\n[Match specifications in Erlang](`e:erts:match_spec.md`) in ERTS User's Guide.","ref":"ms_transform.html#module-warnings-and-restrictions"},{"type":"function","title":"ms_transform.format_error/1","doc":"Takes an error code returned by one of the other functions in the module and\ncreates a textual description of the error.","ref":"ms_transform.html#format_error/1"},{"type":"function","title":"ms_transform.parse_transform/2","doc":"Implements the transformation at compile time.

The stored terms, in this module\ncalled _objects_, are tuples such that one element is defined to be the key. A\nDets _table_ is a collection of objects with the key at the same position stored\non a file.\n\nThis module is used by the Mnesia application, and is provided \"as is\" for users\nwho are interested in efficient storage of Erlang terms on disk only. Many\napplications only need to store some terms in a file. Mnesia adds transactions,\nqueries, and distribution. The size of Dets files cannot exceed 2 GB. If larger\ntables are needed, table fragmentation in Mnesia can be used.\n\nThree types of Dets tables exist:\n\n- `set`. A table of this type has at most one object with a given key. If an\n  object with a key already present in the table is inserted, the existing\n  object is overwritten by the new object.\n- `bag`. A table of this type has zero or more different objects with a given\n  key.\n- `duplicate_bag`. A table of this type has zero or more possibly matching\n  objects with a given key.\n\nDets tables must be opened before they can be updated or read, and when finished\nthey must be properly closed. If a table is not properly closed, Dets\nautomatically repairs the table. This can take a substantial time if the table\nis large. A Dets table is closed when the process which opened the table\nterminates. If many Erlang processes (users) open the same Dets table, they\nshare the table. The table is properly closed when all users have either\nterminated or closed the table. Dets tables are not properly closed if the\nErlang runtime system terminates abnormally.\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> A `^C` command abnormally terminates an Erlang runtime system in a Unix\n> environment with a break-handler.\n\nAs all operations performed by Dets are disk operations, it is important to\nrealize that a single look-up operation involves a series of disk seek and read\noperations. The Dets functions are therefore much slower than the corresponding\n`m:ets` functions, although Dets exports a similar interface.\n\nDets organizes data as a linear hash list and the hash list grows gracefully as\nmore data is inserted into the table. Space management on the file is performed\nby what is called a buddy system. The current implementation keeps the entire\nbuddy system in RAM, which implies that if the table gets heavily fragmented,\nquite some memory can be used up. The only way to defragment a table is to close\nit and then open it again with option `repair` set to `force`.\n\nNotice that type `ordered_set` in Ets is not yet provided by Dets, neither is\nthe limited support for concurrent updates that makes a sequence of `first` and\n`next` calls safe to use on fixed ETS tables. Both these features may be\nprovided by Dets in a future release of Erlang/OTP. Until then, the Mnesia\napplication (or some user-implemented method for locking) must be used to\nimplement safe concurrency. Currently, no Erlang/OTP library has support for\nordered disk-based term storage.\n\nAll Dets functions return `{error, Reason}` if an error occurs (`first/1` and\n`next/2` are exceptions, they exit the process with the error tuple). If badly\nformed arguments are specified, all functions exit the process with a `badarg`\nmessage.","ref":"dets.html"},{"type":"module","title":"See Also - dets","doc":"`m:ets`, `m:mnesia`, `m:qlc`","ref":"dets.html#module-see-also"},{"type":"type","title":"dets.access/0","doc":"","ref":"dets.html#t:access/0"},{"type":"function","title":"dets.all/0","doc":"Returns a list of the names of all open tables on this node.","ref":"dets.html#all/0"},{"type":"type","title":"dets.auto_save/0","doc":"","ref":"dets.html#t:auto_save/0"},{"type":"function","title":"dets.bchunk/2","doc":"Returns a list of objects stored in a table.

The set of edges E is a subset of V × V\n  (the Cartesian product of V with itself).\n\n  In this module, V is allowed to be empty. The so obtained unique digraph is\n  called the _empty digraph_{: #empty_digraph }. Both vertices and edges are\n  represented by unique Erlang terms.\n\n- Digraphs can be annotated with more information. Such information can be\n  attached to the vertices and to the edges of the digraph. An annotated digraph\n  is called a _labeled digraph_, and the information attached to a vertex or an\n  edge is called a _label_{: #label }. Labels are Erlang terms.\n- An edge e = (v, w) is said to _emanate_{: #emanate } from vertex v and to be\n  _incident_{: #incident } on vertex w.\n- The _out-degree_{: #out_degree } of a vertex is the number of edges emanating\n  from that vertex.\n- The _in-degree_{: #in_degree } of a vertex is the number of edges incident on\n  that vertex.\n- If an edge is emanating from v and incident on w, then w is said to be an\n  _out-neighbor_{: #out_neighbour } of v, and v is said to be an _in-neighbor_{:\n  #in_neighbour } of w.\n- A _path_{: #path } P from v\\[1] to v\\[k] in a digraph (V, E) is a non-empty\n  sequence v\\[1], v\\[2], ..., v\\[k] of vertices in V such that there is an edge\n  (v\\[i],v\\[i+1]) in E for 1 <= i < k.\n- The _length_{: #length } of path P is k-1.\n- Path P is _simple_{: #simple_path } if all vertices are distinct, except that\n  the first and the last vertices can be the same.\n- Path P is a _cycle_{: #cycle } if the length of P is not zero and v\\[1] =\n  v\\[k].\n- A _loop_{: #loop } is a cycle of length one.\n- A _simple cycle_{: #simple_cycle } is a path that is both a cycle and simple.\n- An _acyclic digraph_{: #acyclic_digraph } is a digraph without cycles.","ref":"digraph.html"},{"type":"module","title":"See Also - digraph","doc":"`m:digraph_utils`, `m:ets`","ref":"digraph.html#module-see-also"},{"type":"function","title":"digraph.add_edge/3","doc":"Equivalent to  add_edge(G, V1, V2, []) .","ref":"digraph.html#add_edge/3"},{"type":"function","title":"digraph.add_edge/4","doc":"Equivalent to [`add_edge(G, E, V1, V2, Label)`](`add_edge/5`), where `E` is a created edge.\n\nThe created edge is represented by term `['$e' | N]`, where `N` is an integer >= 0.\n\nSee `t:add_edge_err_rsn/0` for details on possible errors.","ref":"digraph.html#add_edge/4"},{"type":"function","title":"digraph.add_edge/5","doc":"Creates (or modifies) an edge with the identifier\n`E` of digraph `G`, using `Label` as the (new) [label](`m:digraph#label`) of the\nedge.

This is the default table type.\n\n- **`ordered_set`** - The table is a `ordered_set` table: one key, one object,\n  ordered in Erlang term order, which is the order implied by the  \n  operators. Tables of this type have a somewhat different behavior in some\n  situations than tables of other types. Most notably, the `ordered_set` tables\n  regard keys as equal when they _compare equal_, not only when they match. This\n  means that to an `ordered_set` table, `t:integer/0` `1` and `t:float/0` `1.0`\n  are regarded as equal. This also means that the key used to lookup an element\n  does not necessarily _match_ the key in the returned elements, if\n  `t:float/0`'s and `t:integer/0`'s are mixed in keys of a table.\n\n- **`bag`** - The table is a `bag` table, which can have many objects, but only\n  one instance of each object, per key.\n\n- **`duplicate_bag`** - The table is a `duplicate_bag` table, which can have\n  many objects, including multiple copies of the same object, per key.\n\n- **`public`** - Any process can read or write to the table.\n\n  [](){: #protected }\n\n- **`protected`** - The owner process can read and write to the table.

To\n  get the table identifier of a named table, use `whereis/1`.\n\n- **`{keypos,Pos}`** - Specifies which element in the stored tuples to use as\n  key. By default, it is the first element, that is, `Pos=1`. However, this is\n  not always appropriate. In particular, we do not want the first element to be\n  the key if we want to store Erlang records in a table.\n\n  Notice that any tuple stored in the table must have at least `Pos` number of\n  elements.\n\n  [](){: #heir }\n\n- **`{heir,Pid,HeirData}  | {heir,Pid} | {heir,none}`** - Set a process as heir.\n  The heir inherits the table if the owner terminates. If `HeirData` is given, a\n  message `{'ETS-TRANSFER',tid(),FromPid,HeirData}` is sent to the heir when\n  that occurs. If `{heir,Pid}` is given, no `'ETS-TRANSFER'` message is\n  sent. The user must then make sure the heir gets notified some other way\n  (through a link or monitor for example) to avoid the table being left unnoticed\n  by its new owner.\n\n  The heir must be a local process.

If set to `true`, the table is optimized for concurrent\n  write access. Different objects of the same table can be mutated (and read) by\n  concurrent processes. This is achieved to some degree at the expense of memory\n  consumption and the performance of sequential access and concurrent reading.\n\n  The `auto` alternative for the `write_concurrency` option is similar to the\n  `true` option but automatically adjusts the synchronization granularity during\n  runtime depending on how the table is used. This is the recommended\n  `write_concurrency` option when using Erlang/OTP 25 and above as it performs\n  well in most scenarios.\n\n  The `write_concurrency` option can be combined with the options\n  [`read_concurrency`](`m:ets#new_2_read_concurrency`) and\n  [`decentralized_counters`](`m:ets#new_2_decentralized_counters`). You\n  typically want to combine `write_concurrency` with `read_concurrency` when\n  large concurrent read bursts and large concurrent write bursts are common; for\n  more information, see option\n  [`read_concurrency`](`m:ets#new_2_read_concurrency`). It is almost always a\n  good idea to combine the `write_concurrency` option with the\n  [`decentralized_counters`](`m:ets#new_2_decentralized_counters`) option.\n\n  Notice that this option does not change any guarantees about\n  [atomicity and isolation](`m:ets#module-concurrency`). Functions that makes such\n  promises over many objects (like `insert/2`) gain less (or nothing) from this\n  option.\n\n  The memory consumption inflicted by both `write_concurrency` and\n  `read_concurrency` is a constant overhead per table for `set`, `bag` and\n  `duplicate_bag` when the `true` alternative for the `write_concurrency` option\n  is not used. For all tables with the `auto` alternative and `ordered_set`\n  tables with `true` alternative the memory overhead depends on the amount of\n  actual detected concurrency during runtime.

However, switching between read and write operations becomes more\n  expensive.\n\n  You typically want to enable this option when concurrent read operations are\n  much more frequent than write operations, or when concurrent reads and writes\n  comes in large read and write bursts (that is, many reads not interrupted by\n  writes, and many writes not interrupted by reads).\n\n  You typically do _not_ want to enable this option when the common access\n  pattern is a few read operations interleaved with a few write operations\n  repeatedly. In this case, you would get a performance degradation by enabling\n  this option.\n\n  Option `read_concurrency` can be combined with option\n  [`write_concurrency`](`m:ets#new_2_write_concurrency`).

For tables of type `ordered_set` the\n  option also defaults to true when the `write_concurrency` option is set to\n  `true`. The option defaults to `false` for all other configurations. This\n  option has no effect if the `write_concurrency` option is set to `false`.\n\n  When this option is set to `true`, the table is optimized for frequent\n  concurrent calls to operations that modify the tables size and/or its memory\n  consumption (e.g., `insert/2` and `delete/2`). The drawback is that calls to\n  `info/1` and `info/2` with `size` or `memory` as the second argument can get\n  much slower when the `decentralized_counters` option is turned on.\n\n  When this option is enabled the counters for the table size and memory\n  consumption are distributed over several cache lines and the scheduling\n  threads are mapped to one of those cache lines.

If tuples are to\nbe constructed, one has to write a tuple of arity 1 where the single element in\nthe tuple is the tuple one wants to construct (as an ordinary tuple can be\nmistaken for a `Guard`).\n\nTherefore the following call:\n\n```erlang\nets:select(Table,[{{'$1','$2','$1'},[],['$_']}])\n```\n\ngives the same output as:\n\n```erlang\nets:select(Table,[{{'$1','$2','$1'},[],[{{'$1','$2','$3'}}]}])\n```\n\nThis syntax is equivalent to the syntax used in the trace patterns (see the\n`m:dbg`) module in Runtime_Tools.\n\nThe `Guard`s are constructed as tuples, where the first element is the test name\nand the remaining elements are the test parameters. To check for a specific type\n(say a list) of the element bound to the match variable `'$1'`, one would write\nthe test as `{is_list, '$1'}`. If the test fails, the object in the table does\nnot match and the next `MatchFunction` (if any) is tried. Most guard tests\npresent in Erlang can be used, but only the new versions prefixed `is_` are\nallowed (`is_float`, `is_atom`, and so on).\n\nThe `Guard` section can also contain logic and arithmetic operations, which are\nwritten with the same syntax as the guard tests (prefix notation), so that the\nfollowing guard test written in Erlang:\n\n```erlang\nis_integer(X), is_integer(Y), X + Y < 4711\n```\n\nis expressed as follows (`X` replaced with `'$1'` and `Y` with `'$2'`):\n\n```erlang\n[{is_integer, '$1'}, {is_integer, '$2'}, {'<', {'+', '$1', '$2'}, 4711}]\n```\n\nFor tables of type `ordered_set`, objects are visited in the same order as in a\n`first`/`next` traversal. This means that the match specification is executed\nagainst objects with keys in the `first`/`next` order and the corresponding\nresult list is in the order of that execution.","ref":"ets.html#select/2"},{"type":"function","title":"ets.select/3","doc":"Works like `select/2`, but only returns a limited (`Limit`) number of matching\nobjects.

In the following, some familiarity with list comprehensions is\nassumed. The examples in section\n[List Comprehensions](`e:system:list_comprehensions.md`) in Programming Examples\ncan get you started. Notice that list comprehensions do not add any\ncomputational power to the language; anything that can be done with list\ncomprehensions can also be done without them. But they add syntax for expressing\nsimple search problems, which is compact and clear once you get used to it.\n\nMany list comprehension expressions can be evaluated by the `qlc` module.\nExceptions are expressions, such that variables introduced in patterns (or\nfilters) are used in some generator later in the list comprehension. As an\nexample, consider an implementation of `lists:append(L)`:\n`[X ||Y <- L, X <- Y]`. `Y` is introduced in the first generator and used in the\nsecond. The ordinary list comprehension is normally to be preferred when there\nis a choice as to which to use. One difference is that [`eval/1,2`](`eval/1`)\ncollects answers in a list that is finally reversed, while list comprehensions\ncollect answers on the stack that is finally unwound.\n\nWhat the `qlc` module primarily adds to list comprehensions is that data can be\nread from QLC tables in small chunks. A QLC table is created by calling\n[`qlc:table/2`](`table/2`). Usually `qlc:table/2` is not called directly from\nthe query but through an interface function of some data structure. Erlang/OTP\nincludes a few examples of such functions:\n[`mnesia:table/1,2`](`mnesia:table/1`), [`ets:table/1,2`](`ets:table/1`), and\n[`dets:table/1,2`](`dets:table/1`). For a given data structure, many functions\ncan create QLC tables, but common for these functions is that they return a\nquery handle created by [`qlc:table/2`](`table/2`). Using the QLC tables\nprovided by Erlang/OTP is usually probably sufficient, but for the more advanced\nuser section [Implementing a QLC Table](`m:qlc#implementing_a_qlc_table`)\ndescribes the implementation of a function calling `qlc:table/2`.\n\nBesides `qlc:table/2`, other functions return query handles. They are used more\nseldom than tables, but are sometimes useful. [`qlc:append/1,2`](`append/1`)\ntraverses objects from many tables or lists after each other. If, for example,\nyou want to traverse all answers to a query `QH` and then finish off by a term\n`{finished}`, you can do that by calling `qlc:append(QH, [{finished}])`.\n[`append/2`](`append/2`) first returns all objects of `QH`, then `{finished}`.\nIf a tuple `{finished}` exists among the answers to `QH`, it is returned twice\nfrom [`append/2`](`append/2`).\n\nAs another example, consider concatenating the answers to two queries `QH1` and\n`QH2` while removing all duplicates. This is accomplished by using option\n`unique`:\n\n```erlang\nqlc:q([X || X <- qlc:append(QH1, QH2)], {unique, true})\n```\n\nThe cost is substantial: every returned answer is stored in an ETS table. Before\nreturning an answer, it is looked up in the ETS table to check if it has already\nbeen returned. Without the `unique` option, all answers to `QH1` would be\nreturned followed by all answers to `QH2`. The `unique` option keeps the order\nbetween the remaining answers.\n\nIf the order of the answers is not important, there is an alternative to the\n`unique` option, namely to sort the answers uniquely:\n\n```erlang\nqlc:sort(qlc:q([X || X <- qlc:append(QH1, QH2)], {unique, true})).\n```\n\nThis query also removes duplicates but the answers are sorted. If there are many\nanswers, temporary files are used. Notice that to get the first unique answer,\nall answers must be found and sorted. Both alternatives find duplicates by\ncomparing answers, that is, if `A1` and `A2` are answers found in that order,\nthen `A2` is a removed if `A1 == A2`.\n\nTo return only a few answers, cursors can be used. The following code returns no\nmore than five answers using an ETS table for storing the unique answers:\n\n```erlang\nC = qlc:cursor(qlc:q([X || X <- qlc:append(QH1, QH2)],{unique,true})),\nR = qlc:next_answers(C, 5),\nok = qlc:delete_cursor(C),\nR.\n```\n\nQLCs are convenient for stating constraints on data from two or more tables. The\nfollowing example does a natural join on two query handles on position 2:\n\n```erlang\nqlc:q([{X1,X2,X3,Y1} ||\n          {X1,X2,X3} <- QH1,\n          {Y1,Y2} <- QH2,\n          X2 =:= Y2])\n```\n\nThe `qlc` module evaluates this differently depending on the query handles `QH1`\nand `QH2`. If, for example, `X2` is matched against the key of a QLC table, the\nlookup join method traverses the objects of `QH2` while looking up key values in\nthe table. However, if not `X2` or `Y2` is matched against the key or an indexed\nposition of a QLC table, the merge join method ensures that `QH1` and `QH2` are\nboth sorted on position 2 and next do the join by traversing the objects one by\none.\n\nOption `join` can be used to force the `qlc` module to use a certain join\nmethod. For the rest of this section it is assumed that the excessively slow\njoin method called \"nested loop\" has been chosen:\n\n```erlang\nqlc:q([{X1,X2,X3,Y1} ||\n          {X1,X2,X3} <- QH1,\n          {Y1,Y2} <- QH2,\n          X2 =:= Y2],\n      {join, nested_loop})\n```\n\nIn this case the filter is applied to every possible pair of answers to `QH1`\nand `QH2`, one at a time. If there are M answers to `QH1` and N answers to\n`QH2`, the filter is run M\\*N times.\n\nIf `QH2` is a call to the function for `m:gb_trees`, as defined in section\n[Implementing a QLC Table](`m:qlc#implementing_a_qlc_table`), then\n[`gb_table:table/1` ](`m:qlc#gb_table`), the iterator for the gb-tree is\ninitiated for each answer to `QH1`. The objects of the gb-tree are then returned\none by one. This is probably the most efficient way of traversing the table in\nthat case, as it takes minimal computational power to get the following object.\nBut if `QH2` is not a table but a more complicated QLC, it can be more efficient\nto use some RAM memory for collecting the answers in a cache, particularly if\nthere are only a few answers. It must then be assumed that evaluating `QH2` has\nno side effects so that the meaning of the query does not change if `QH2` is\nevaluated only once. One way of caching the answers is to evaluate `QH2` first\nof all and substitute the list of answers for `QH2` in the query. Another way is\nto use option `cache`. It is expressed like this:\n\n```erlang\nQH2' = qlc:q([X || X <- QH2], {cache, ets})\n```\n\nor only\n\n```text\nQH2' = qlc:q([X || X <- QH2], cache)\n```\n\nThe effect of option `cache` is that when generator `QH2'` is run the first\ntime, every answer is stored in an ETS table. When the next answer of `QH1` is\ntried, answers to `QH2'` are copied from the ETS table, which is very fast. As\nfor option `unique` the cost is a possibly substantial amount of RAM memory.\n\nOption `{cache, list}` offers the possibility to store the answers in a list on\nthe process heap. This has the potential of being faster than ETS tables, as\nthere is no need to copy answers from the table. However, it can often result in\nslower evaluation because of more garbage collections of the process heap and\nincreased RAM memory consumption because of larger heaps. Another drawback with\ncache lists is that if the list size exceeds a limit, a temporary file is used.\nReading the answers from a file is much slower than copying them from an ETS\ntable. But if the available RAM memory is scarce, setting the\n[limit](`m:qlc#max_list_size`) to some low value is an alternative.\n\nOption `cache_all` can be set to `ets` or `list` when evaluating a query.

The `qlc` module requires that there is a way of\ntraversing all objects of the data structure. `gb_trees` has an iterator\nfunction suitable for that purpose. Notice that for each object returned, a new\nfun is created. As long as the list is not terminated by `[]`, it is assumed\nthat the tail of the list is a nullary function and that calling the function\nreturns further objects (and functions).\n\nThe lookup function is optional. It is assumed that the lookup function always\nfinds values much faster than it would take to traverse the table. The first\nargument is the position of the key. As `qlc_next/1` returns the objects as\n`{Key, Value}` pairs, the position is 1. Notice that the lookup function is to\nreturn `{Key, Value}` pairs, as the traversal function does.\n\nThe format function is also optional. It is called by [`info/1,2`](`info/1`) to\ngive feedback at runtime of how the query is to be evaluated. Try to give as\ngood feedback as possible without showing too much details. In the example, at\nmost seven objects of the table are shown. The format function handles two\ncases: `all` means that all objects of the table are traversed;\n`{lookup, 1, KeyValues}` means that the lookup function is used for looking up\nkey values.\n\nWhether the whole table is traversed or only some keys looked up depends on how\nthe query is expressed. If the query has the form\n\n```text\nqlc:q([T || P <- LE, F])\n```\n\nand `P` is a tuple, the `qlc` module analyzes `P` and `F` in compile time to\nfind positions of tuple `P` that are tested for equality to constants. If such a\nposition at runtime turns out to be the key position, the lookup function can be\nused, otherwise all objects of the table must be traversed. The info function\n`InfoFun` returns the key position. There can be indexed positions as well, also\nreturned by the info function. An index is an extra table that makes lookup on\nsome position fast. Mnesia maintains indexes upon request, and introduces so\ncalled secondary keys. The `qlc` module prefers to look up objects using the key\nbefore secondary keys regardless of the number of constants to look up.","ref":"qlc.html#module-implementing-a-qlc-table"},{"type":"module","title":"Key Equality - qlc","doc":"Erlang/OTP has two operators for testing term equality: `==/2` and `=:=/2`. The\ndifference is all about the integers that can be represented by floats. For\nexample, `2 == 2.0` evaluates to `true` while `2 =:= 2.0` evaluates to `false`.\nNormally this is a minor issue, but the `qlc` module cannot ignore the\ndifference, which affects the user's choice of operators in QLCs.\n\nIf the `qlc` module at compile time can determine that some constant is free of\nintegers, it does not matter which one of `==/2` or `=:=/2` is used:\n\n```erlang\n1> E1 = ets:new(t, [set]), % uses =:=/2 for key equality\nQ1 = qlc:q([K ||\n{K} <- ets:table(E1),\nK == 2.71 orelse K == a]),\nio:format(\"~s~n\", [qlc:info(Q1)]).\nets:match_spec_run(\n       lists:flatmap(fun(V) ->\n\t\t\t    ets:lookup(#Ref<0.3098908599.2283929601.256025>,\n\t\t\t\t       V)\n\t\t     end,\n\t\t     [a, 2.71]),\n       ets:match_spec_compile([{{'$1'}, [], ['$1']}]))\n```\n\nIn the example, operator `==/2` has been handled exactly as `=:=/2` would have\nbeen handled. However, if it cannot be determined at compile time that some\nconstant is free of integers, and the table uses `=:=/2` when comparing keys for\nequality (see option [key_equality](`m:qlc#key_equality`)), then the `qlc`\nmodule does not try to look up the constant. The reason is that there is in the\ngeneral case no upper limit on the number of key values that can compare equal\nto such a constant; every combination of integers and floats must be looked up:\n\n```erlang\n2> E2 = ets:new(t, [set]),\ntrue = ets:insert(E2, [{{2,2},a},{{2,2.0},b},{{2.0,2},c}]),\nF2 = fun(I) ->\nqlc:q([V || {K,V} <- ets:table(E2), K == I])\nend,\nQ2 = F2({2,2}),\nio:format(\"~s~n\", [qlc:info(Q2)]).\nets:table(#Ref<0.3098908599.2283929601.256125>,\n          [{traverse,\n            {select,\n             [{{'$1', '$2'}, [{'==', '$1', {const, {2, 2}}}], ['$2']}]}}])\n3> lists:sort(qlc:e(Q2)).\n[a,b,c]\n```\n\nLooking up only `{2,2}` would not return `b` and `c`.\n\nIf the table uses `==/2` when comparing keys for equality, the `qlc` module\nlooks up the constant regardless of which operator is used in the QLC. However,\n`==/2` is to be preferred:\n\n```erlang\n4> E3 = ets:new(t, [ordered_set]), % uses ==/2 for key equality\ntrue = ets:insert(E3, [{{2,2.0},b}]),\nF3 = fun(I) ->\nqlc:q([V || {K,V} <- ets:table(E3), K == I])\nend,\nQ3 = F3({2,2}),\nio:format(\"~s~n\", [qlc:info(Q3)]).\nets:match_spec_run(ets:lookup(#Ref<0.3098908599.2283929601.256211>,\n                              {2, 2}),\n                   ets:match_spec_compile([{{'$1', '$2'}, [], ['$2']}]))\n5> qlc:e(Q3).\n[b]\n```\n\nLookup join is handled analogously to lookup of constants in a table: if the\njoin operator is `==/2`, and the table where constants are to be looked up uses\n`=:=/2` when testing keys for equality, then the `qlc` module does not consider\nlookup join for that table.","ref":"qlc.html#module-key-equality"},{"type":"module","title":"See Also - qlc","doc":"`m:dets`, `m:erl_eval`, `m:erlang`, `m:error_logger`, `m:ets`, `m:file`,\n`m:file_sorter`, `m:mnesia`, `m:shell`,\n[Erlang Reference Manual](`e:system:index.html`),\n[Programming Examples](`e:system:index.html`)","ref":"qlc.html#module-see-also"},{"type":"type","title":"qlc.abstract_expr/0","doc":"Parse trees for Erlang expression, see section\n[The Abstract Format](`e:erts:absform.md`) in the ERTS User's Guide.","ref":"qlc.html#t:abstract_expr/0"},{"type":"type","title":"qlc.answer/0","doc":"","ref":"qlc.html#t:answer/0"},{"type":"type","title":"qlc.answers/0","doc":"","ref":"qlc.html#t:answers/0"},{"type":"function","title":"qlc.append/1","doc":"Returns a query handle.

Option\n  `unique` is equivalent to `{unique, true}`. If option `unique` is combined\n  with option `{cache, ets}`, two ETS tables are used, but the full answers are\n  stored in one table only. If option `unique` is combined with option\n  `{cache, list}`, the answers are sorted twice using `keysort/3`; once to\n  remove duplicates and once to restore the order.\n\nOptions `cache` and `unique` apply not only to the QLC itself but also to the\nresults of looking up constants, running match specifications, and joining\nhandles.\n\n_Example:_\n\nIn the following example the cached results of the merge join are traversed for\neach value of `A`. Notice that without option `cache` the join would have been\ncarried out three times, once for each value of `A`.\n\n```erlang\n1> Q = qlc:q([{A,X,Z,W} ||\nA <- [a,b,c],\n{X,Z} <- [{a,1},{b,4},{c,6}],\n{W,Y} <- [{2,a},{3,b},{4,c}],\nX =:= Y],\n{cache, list}),\nio:format(\"~s~n\", [qlc:info(Q)]).\nbegin\n    V1 =\n        qlc:q([\n               P0 ||\n                   P0 = {X, Z} <-\n                       qlc:keysort(1, [{a, 1}, {b, 4}, {c, 6}], [])\n              ]),\n    V2 =\n        qlc:q([\n               P0 ||\n                   P0 = {W, Y} <-\n                       qlc:keysort(2, [{2, a}, {3, b}, {4, c}], [])\n              ]),\n    V3 =\n        qlc:q([\n               [G1 | G2] ||\n                   G1 <- V1,\n                   G2 <- V2,\n                   element(1, G1) == element(2, G2)\n              ],\n              [{join, merge}, {cache, list}]),\n    qlc:q([\n           {A, X, Z, W} ||\n               A <- [a, b, c],\n               [{X, Z} | {W, Y}] <- V3,\n               X =:= Y\n          ])\nend\n```\n\n[`sort/1,2`](`sort/1`) and [`keysort/2,3`](`keysort/2`) can also be used for\ncaching answers and for removing duplicates. When sorting answers are cached in\na list, possibly stored on a temporary file, and no ETS tables are used.\n\nSometimes (see `table/2`) traversal of tables can be done by looking up key\nvalues, which is assumed to be fast. Under certain (rare) circumstances there\ncan be too many key values to look up. [](){: #max_lookup } Option\n`{max_lookup, MaxLookup}` can then be used to limit the number of lookups: if\nmore than `MaxLookup` lookups would be required, no lookups are done but the\ntable is traversed instead. Defaults to `infinity`, which means that there is no\nlimit on the number of keys to look up.\n\n_Example:_\n\nIn the following example, using the `gb_table` module from section\n[Implementing a QLC Table](`m:qlc#implementing_a_qlc_table`), there are six keys\nto look up: `{1,a}`, `{1,b}`, `{1,c}`, `{2,a}`, `{2,b}`, and `{2,c}`. The reason\nis that the two elements of key `{X, Y}` are compared separately.\n\n```erlang\n1> T = gb_trees:empty(),\nQH = qlc:q([X || {{X,Y},_} <- gb_table:table(T),\n((X == 1) or (X == 2)) andalso\n((Y == a) or (Y == b) or (Y == c))]),\nio:format(\"~s~n\", [qlc:info(QH)]).\nets:match_spec_run(\n       lists:flatmap(fun(K) ->\n                            case\n                                gb_trees:lookup(K,\n                                                gb_trees:from_orddict([]))\n                            of\n                                {value, V} ->\n                                    [{K, V}];\n                                none ->\n                                    []\n                            end\n                     end,\n                     [{1, a},\n                      {1, b},\n                      {1, c},\n                      {2, a},\n                      {2, b},\n                      {2, c}]),\n       ets:match_spec_compile([{{{'$1', '$2'}, '_'},\n                                [],\n                                ['$1']}]))\n```\n\nOptions:\n\n- Option `{lookup, true}` can be used to ensure that the `qlc` module looks up\n  constants in some QLC table. If there are more than one QLC table among the\n  list expressions of the generators, constants must be looked up in at least\n  one of the tables. The evaluation of the query fails if there are no constants\n  to look up. This option is useful when it would be unacceptable to traverse\n  all objects in some table. Setting option `lookup` to `false` ensures that no\n  constants are looked up (`{max_lookup, 0}` has the same effect). Defaults to\n  `any`, which means that constants are looked up whenever possible.\n- Option `{join, Join}` can be used to ensure that a certain join method is\n  used:\n\n  - `{join, lookup}` invokes the lookup join method.\n  - `{join, merge}` invokes the merge join method.\n  - `{join, nested_loop}` invokes the method of matching every pair of objects\n    from two handles. This method is mostly very slow.\n\n  The evaluation of the query fails if the `qlc` module cannot carry out the\n  chosen join method. Defaults to `any`, which means that some fast join method\n  is used if possible.","ref":"qlc.html#q/2"},{"type":"opaque","title":"qlc.query_cursor/0","doc":"A [query cursor](`m:qlc#query_cursor`).","ref":"qlc.html#t:query_cursor/0"},{"type":"opaque","title":"qlc.query_handle/0","doc":"A [query handle](`m:qlc#query_handle`).","ref":"qlc.html#t:query_handle/0"},{"type":"type","title":"qlc.query_handle_or_list/0","doc":"","ref":"qlc.html#t:query_handle_or_list/0"},{"type":"type","title":"qlc.query_list_comprehension/0","doc":"A literal [query list comprehension](`m:qlc#query_list_comprehension`).","ref":"qlc.html#t:query_list_comprehension/0"},{"type":"function","title":"qlc.sort/1","doc":"Equivalent to  sort(QH, []) .","ref":"qlc.html#sort/1"},{"type":"function","title":"qlc.sort/2","doc":"Returns a query handle.

In Erlang/OTP there is support for ETS,\nDets, and Mnesia tables, but many other data structures can be turned into QLC\ntables. This is accomplished by letting function(s) in the module implementing\nthe data structure create a query handle by calling `qlc:table/2`.\n\nThe different ways to traverse the table and properties of the table are handled\nby callback functions provided as options to `qlc:table/2`.\n\n- Callback function `TraverseFun` is used for traversing the table. It is to\n  return a list of objects terminated by either `[]` or a nullary fun to be used\n  for traversing the not yet traversed objects of the table. Any other return\n  value is immediately returned as value of the query evaluation. Unary\n  `TraverseFun`s are to accept a match specification as argument. The match\n  specification is created by the parse transform by analyzing the pattern of\n  the generator calling `qlc:table/2` and filters using variables introduced in\n  the pattern. If the parse transform cannot find a match specification\n  equivalent to the pattern and filters, `TraverseFun` is called with a match\n  specification returning every object.\n\n  - Modules that can use match specifications for optimized traversal of tables\n    are to call `qlc:table/2` with an unary `TraverseFun`. An example is\n    `ets:table/2`.\n  - Other modules can provide a nullary `TraverseFun`. An example is\n    [`gb_table:table/1`](`m:qlc#gb_table`) in section\n    [Implementing a QLC Table](`m:qlc#implementing_a_qlc_table`).\n\n- Unary callback function `PreFun` is called once before the table is read for\n  the first time. If the call fails, the query evaluation fails.\n\n  Argument `PreArgs` is a list of tagged values. There are two tags,\n  `parent_value` and `stop_fun`, used by Mnesia for managing transactions.\n\n  - The value of `parent_value` is the value returned by `ParentFun`, or\n    `undefined` if there is no `ParentFun`. `ParentFun` is called once just\n    before the call of `PreFun` in the context of the process calling\n    [`eval/1,2`](`eval/1`), [`fold/3,4`](`fold/3`), or\n    [`cursor/1,2`](`cursor/1`).\n  - The value of `stop_fun` is a nullary fun that deletes the cursor if called\n    from the parent, or `undefined` if there is no cursor.\n\n- Nullary callback function `PostFun` is called once after the table was last\n  read. The return value, which is caught, is ignored. If `PreFun` has been\n  called for a table, `PostFun` is guaranteed to be called for that table, even\n  if the evaluation of the query fails for some reason.\n\n  The pre (post) functions for different tables are evaluated in unspecified\n  order.\n\n  Other table access than reading, such as calling `InfoFun`, is assumed to be\n  OK at any time.\n\n- [](){: #lookup_fun } Binary callback function `LookupFun` is used for looking\n  up objects in the table. The first argument `Position` is the key position or\n  an indexed position and the second argument `Keys` is a sorted list of unique\n  values. The return value is to be a list of all objects (tuples), such that\n  the element at `Position` is a member of `Keys`. Any other return value is\n  immediately returned as value of the query evaluation. `LookupFun` is called\n  instead of traversing the table if the parse transform at compile time can\n  determine that the filters match and compare the element at `Position` in such\n  a way that only `Keys` need to be looked up to find all potential answers.\n\n  The key position is obtained by calling `InfoFun(keypos)` and the indexed\n  positions by calling `InfoFun(indices)`. If the key position can be used for\n  lookup, it is always chosen, otherwise the indexed position requiring the\n  least number of lookups is chosen. If there is a tie between two indexed\n  positions, the one occurring first in the list returned by `InfoFun` is\n  chosen. Positions requiring more than [max_lookup](`m:qlc#max_lookup`) lookups\n  are ignored.\n\n- Unary callback function `InfoFun` is to return information about the table.\n  `undefined` is to be returned if the value of some tag is unknown:\n\n  - **`indices`** - Returns a list of indexed positions, a list of positive\n    integers.\n\n  - **`is_unique_objects`** - Returns `true` if the objects returned by\n    `TraverseFun` are unique.\n\n  - **`keypos`** - Returns the position of the table key, a positive integer.\n\n  - **`is_sorted_key`** - Returns `true` if the objects returned by\n    `TraverseFun` are sorted on the key.\n\n  - **`num_of_objects`** - Returns the number of objects in the table, a\n    non-negative integer.\n\n- Unary callback function `FormatFun` is used by [`info/1,2`](`info/1`) for\n  displaying the call that created the query handle of the table. Defaults to\n  `undefined`, which means that `info/1,2` displays a call to `'$MOD':'$FUN'/0`.\n  It is up to `FormatFun` to present the selected objects of the table in a\n  suitable way. However, if a character list is chosen for presentation, it must\n  be an Erlang expression that can be scanned and parsed (a trailing dot is\n  added by `info/1,2` though).\n\n  `FormatFun` is called with an argument that describes the selected objects\n  based on optimizations done as a result of analyzing the filters of the QLC\n  where the call to `qlc:table/2` occurs. The argument can have the following\n  values:\n\n  - **`{lookup, Position, Keys, NElements, DepthFun}`.** - `LookupFun` is used\n    for looking up objects in the table.\n\n  - **`{match_spec, MatchExpression}`** - No way of finding all possible answers\n    by looking up keys was found, but the filters could be transformed into a\n    match specification. All answers are found by calling\n    `TraverseFun(MatchExpression)`.\n\n  - **`{all, NElements, DepthFun}`** - No optimization was found. A match\n    specification matching all objects is used if `TraverseFun` is unary.\n\n    `NElements` is the value of the `info/1,2` option `n_elements`.\n\n    `DepthFun` is a function that can be used for limiting the size of terms;\n    calling `DepthFun(Term)` substitutes `'...'` for parts of `Term` below the\n    depth specified by the `info/1,2` option `depth`.\n\n    If calling `FormatFun` with an argument including `NElements` and `DepthFun`\n    fails, `FormatFun` is called once again with an argument excluding\n    `NElements` and `DepthFun` (`{lookup, Position, Keys}` or `all`).\n\n- [](){: #key_equality } The value of option `key_equality` is to be `'=:='` if\n  the table considers two keys equal if they match, and to be `'=='` if two keys\n  are equal if they compare equal. Defaults to `'=:='`.\n\nFor the various options recognized by `table/1,2` in respective module, see\n[`ets`](`ets:table/1`), [`dets`](`dets:table/1`), and\n[`mnesia`](`mnesia:table/1`).","ref":"qlc.html#table/2"},{"type":"type","title":"qlc.tmp_directory/0","doc":"","ref":"qlc.html#t:tmp_directory/0"},{"type":"type","title":"qlc.tmp_file_usage/0","doc":"","ref":"qlc.html#t:tmp_file_usage/0"},{"type":"module","title":"queue","doc":"Abstract data type for FIFO queues.\n\nThis module provides (double-ended) FIFO queues in an efficient manner.\n\nAll functions fail with reason `badarg` if arguments are of wrong type, for\nexample, queue arguments are not queues, indexes are not integers, and list\narguments are not lists. Improper lists cause internal crashes. An index out of\nrange for a queue also causes a failure with reason `badarg`.\n\nSome functions, where noted, fail with reason `empty` for an empty queue.\n\nThe data representing a queue as used by this module is to be regarded as opaque\nby other modules. In abstract terms, the representation is a composite type of\nexisting Erlang terms. See note on\n[data types](`e:system:data_types.md#no_user_types`).

Also the \"Okasaki API\" functions build less garbage.\n\nThe \"Okasaki API\" is inspired by \"Purely Functional Data Structures\" by Chris\nOkasaki. It regards queues as lists.

Sentences are expressed using the logical\noperators \"for some\" (or \"there exists\"), \"for all\", \"and\", \"or\", \"not\". If the\nexistence of a set containing all the specified elements is known (as is always\nthe case in this module), this is denoted B = \\{x : S(x)\\}.\n\n- The _unordered set_ containing the elements a, b, and c is denoted\n  \\{a, b, c\\}. This notation is not to be confused with tuples.\n\n  The _ordered pair_ of a and b, with first _coordinate_ a and second coordinate\n  b, is denoted (a, b). An ordered pair is an _ordered set_ of two elements. In\n  this module, ordered sets can contain one, two, or more elements, and\n  parentheses are used to enclose the elements.\n\n  Unordered sets and ordered sets are orthogonal, again in this module; there is\n  no unordered set equal to any ordered set.\n\n- The _empty set_ contains no elements.\n\n  Set A is _equal_{: #equal } to set B if they contain the same elements, which\n  is denoted A = B.

Let R be a relation. The fact\n  that (x, y) belongs to R is written as x R y. As relations are sets, the\n  definitions of the last item (subset, union, and so on) apply to relations as\n  well.\n\n  The _domain_{: #domain } of R is the set \\{x : x R y for some y in Y\\}.\n\n  The _range_{: #range } of R is the set \\{y : x R y for some x in X\\}.\n\n  The _converse_{: #converse } of R is the set \\{a : a = (y, x) for some\n  (x, y) in R\\}.\n\n  If A is a subset of X, the _image_{: #image } of A under R is the set \\{y :\n  x R y for some x in A\\}. If B is a subset of Y, the _inverse image_{:\n  #inverse_image } of B is the set \\{x : x R y for some y in B\\}.\n\n  If R is a relation from X to Y, and S is a relation from Y to Z, the _relative\n  product_{: #relative_product } of R and S is the relation T from X to Z\n  defined so that x T z if and only if there exists an element y in Y such that\n  x R y and y S z.\n\n  The _restriction_{: #restriction } of R to A is the set S defined so that\n  x S y if and only if there exists an element x in A such that x R y.\n\n  If S is a restriction of R to A, then R is an _extension_{: #extension } of S\n  to X.\n\n  If X = Y, then R is called a relation _in_ X.\n\n  The _field_{: #field } of a relation R in X is the union of the domain of R\n  and the range of R.\n\n  If R is a relation in X, and if S is defined so that x S y if x R y and not\n  x = y, then S is the _strict_{: #strict_relation } relation corresponding to\n  R. Conversely, if S is a relation in X, and if R is defined so that x R y if\n  x S y or x = y, then R is the _weak_{: #weak_relation } relation corresponding\n  to S.\n\n  A relation R in X is _reflexive_ if x R x for every element x of X, it is\n  _symmetric_ if x R y implies that y R x, and it is _transitive_ if x R y and\n  y R z imply that x R z.\n\n- A _function_{: #function } F is a relation, a subset of X × Y, such that the\n  domain of F is equal to X and such that for every x in X there is a unique\n  element y in Y with (x, y) in F. The latter condition can be formulated as\n  follows: if x F y and x F z, then y = z. In this module, it is not required\n  that the domain of F is equal to X for a relation to be considered a function.\n\n  Instead of writing (x, y) in F or x F y, we write F(x) = y when F is a\n  function, and say that F maps x onto y, or that the value of F at x is y.\n\n  As functions are relations, the definitions of the last item (domain, range,\n  and so on) apply to functions as well.\n\n  If the converse of a function F is a function F', then F' is called the\n  _inverse_{: #inverse } of F.\n\n  The relative product of two functions F1 and F2 is called the _composite_{:\n  #composite } of F1 and F2 if the range of F1 is a subset of the domain of F2.\n\n- Sometimes, when the range of a function is more important than the function\n  itself, the function is called a _family_.\n\n  The domain of a family is called the _index set_, and the range is called the\n  _indexed set_.\n\n  If x is a family from I to X, then x\\[i] denotes the value of the function at\n  index i. The notation \"a family in X\" is used for such a family.\n\n  When the indexed set is a set of subsets of a set X, we call x a _family of\n  subsets_{: #family } of X.\n\n  If x is a family of subsets of X, the union of the range of x is called the\n  _union of the family_ x.\n\n  If x is non-empty (the index set is non-empty), the _intersection of the\n  family_ x is the intersection of the range of x.\n\n  In this module, the only families that are considered are families of subsets\n  of some set X; in the following, the word \"family\" is used for such families\n  of subsets.\n\n- A _partition_{: #partition } of a set X is a collection S of non-empty subsets\n  of X whose union is X and whose elements are pairwise disjoint.\n\n  A relation in a set is an _equivalence relation_ if it is reflexive,\n  symmetric, and transitive.\n\n  If R is an equivalence relation in X, and x is an element of X, the\n  _equivalence class_{: #equivalence_class } of x with respect to R is the set\n  of all those elements y of X for which x R y holds. The equivalence classes\n  constitute a partitioning of X. Conversely, if C is a partition of X, the\n  relation that holds for any two elements of X if they belong to the same\n  equivalence class, is an equivalence relation induced by the partition C.\n\n  If R is an equivalence relation in X, the _canonical map_{: #canonical_map }\n  is the function that maps every element of X onto its equivalence class.\n\n- [](){: #binary_relation } Relations as defined above (as sets of ordered\n  pairs) are from now on referred to as _binary relations_.\n\n  We call a set of ordered sets (x\\[1], ..., x\\[n]) an _(n-ary) relation_{:\n  #n_ary_relation }, and say that the relation is a subset of the [](){:\n  #Cartesian_product_tuple } Cartesian product X\\[1] × ... × X\\[n], where x\\[i]\n  is an element of X\\[i], 1 <= i <= n.\n\n  The _projection_{: #projection } of an n-ary relation R onto coordinate i is\n  the set \\{x\\[i] : (x\\[1], ..., x\\[i], ..., x\\[n]) in R for some\n  x\\[j] in X\\[j], 1 <= j <= n and not i = j\\}. The projections of a binary\n  relation R onto the first and second coordinates are the domain and the range\n  of R, respectively.\n\n  The relative product of binary relations can be generalized to n-ary relations\n  as follows. Let TR be an ordered set (R\\[1], ..., R\\[n]) of binary relations\n  from X to Y\\[i] and S a binary relation from (Y\\[1] × ... × Y\\[n]) to Z. The\n  _relative product_{: #tuple_relative_product } of TR and S is the binary\n  relation T from X to Z defined so that x T z if and only if there exists an\n  element y\\[i] in Y\\[i] for each 1 <= i <= n such that x R\\[i] y\\[i] and\n  (y\\[1], ..., y\\[n]) S z. Now let TR be a an ordered set (R\\[1], ..., R\\[n]) of\n  binary relations from X\\[i] to Y\\[i] and S a subset of X\\[1] × ... × X\\[n].\n\n  The _multiple relative product_{: #multiple_relative_product } of TR and S is\n  defined to be the set \\{z : z = ((x\\[1], ..., x\\[n]), (y\\[1],...,y\\[n])) for\n  some (x\\[1], ..., x\\[n]) in S and for some (x\\[i], y\\[i]) in R\\[i],\n  1 <= i <= n\\}.\n\n  The _natural join_{: #natural_join } of an n-ary relation R and an m-ary\n  relation S on coordinate i and j is defined to be the set \\{z : z =\n  (x\\[1], ..., x\\[n],  y\\[1], ..., y\\[j-1], y\\[j+1], ..., y\\[m]) for some\n  (x\\[1], ..., x\\[n]) in R and for some (y\\[1], ..., y\\[m]) in S such that\n  x\\[i] = y\\[j]\\}.","ref":"sofs.html#module-set-theory"},{"type":"module","title":"Sets handled by this module - sofs","doc":"The sets recognized by this module are represented\nby elements of the relation Sets, which is defined as the smallest set such\nthat:\n\n- For every atom T, except '\\_', and for every term X, (T, X) belongs to Sets\n  (_atomic sets_).\n- (\\['\\_'], []) belongs to Sets (the _untyped empty set_).\n- For every tuple T = \\{T\\[1], ..., T\\[n]\\} and for every tuple X =\n  \\{X\\[1], ..., X\\[n]\\}, if (T\\[i], X\\[i]) belongs to Sets for every\n  1 <= i <= n, then (T, X) belongs to Sets (_ordered sets_).\n- For every term T, if X is the empty list or a non-empty sorted list\n  \\[X[1], ..., X\\[n]] without duplicates such that (T, X\\[i]) belongs to Sets\n  for every 1 <= i <= n, then (\\[T], X) belongs to Sets (_typed unordered\n  sets_).\n\nAn _external set_{: #external_set } is an element of the range of Sets.\n\nA _type_{: #type } is an element of the domain of Sets.\n\nIf S is an element (T, X) of Sets, then T is a _valid type_{: #valid_type } of\nX, T is the type of S, and X is the external set of S. `from_term/2` creates a\nset from a type and an Erlang term turned into an external set.\n\nThe sets represented by Sets are the elements of the range of function Set\nfrom Sets to Erlang terms and sets of Erlang terms:\n\n- Set(T,Term) = Term, where T is an atom\n- Set(\\{T\\[1], ..., T\\[n]\\}, \\{X\\[1], ...,  X\\[n]\\}) =\n  (Set(T\\[1], X\\[1]), ...,  Set(T\\[n], X\\[n]))\n- Set(\\[T], \\[X[1], ..., X\\[n]]) = \\{Set(T, X\\[1]), ..., Set(T, X\\[n])\\}\n- Set(\\[T], []) = \\{\\}\n\nWhen there is no risk of confusion, elements of Sets are identified with the\nsets they represent. For example, if U is the result of calling `union/2` with\nS1 and S2 as arguments, then U is said to be the union of S1 and S2. A more\nprecise formulation is that Set(U) is the union of Set(S1) and Set(S2).\n\nThe types are used to implement the various conditions that sets must fulfill.\nAs an example, consider the relative product of two sets R and S, and recall\nthat the relative product of R and S is defined if R is a binary relation to Y\nand S is a binary relation from Y. The function that implements the relative\nproduct, `relative_product/2`, checks that the arguments represent binary\nrelations by matching \\[\\{A,B\\}] against the type of the first argument (Arg1\nsay), and \\[\\{C,D\\}] against the type of the second argument (Arg2 say). The\nfact that \\[\\{A,B\\}] matches the type of Arg1 is to be interpreted as Arg1\nrepresenting a binary relation from X to Y, where X is defined as all sets\nSet(x) for some element x in Sets the type of which is A, and similarly for Y.\nIn the same way Arg2 is interpreted as representing a binary relation from W to\nZ. Finally it is checked that B matches C, which is sufficient to ensure that W\nis equal to Y. The untyped empty set is handled separately: its type, \\['\\_'],\nmatches the type of any unordered set.\n\nA few functions of this module (`drestriction/3`, `family_projection/2`,\n`partition/2`, `partition_family/2`, `projection/2`, `restriction/3`,\n`substitution/2`) accept an Erlang function as a means to modify each element of\na given unordered set. [](){: #set_fun } Such a function, called SetFun in the\nfollowing, can be specified as a functional object (fun), a tuple\n`{external, Fun}`, or an integer:\n\n- If SetFun is specified as a fun, the fun is applied to each element of the\n  given set and the return value is assumed to be a set.\n- If SetFun is specified as a tuple `{external, Fun}`, Fun is applied to the\n  external set of each element of the given set and the return value is assumed\n  to be an external set. Selecting the elements of an unordered set as external\n  sets and assembling a new unordered set from a list of external sets is in the\n  present implementation more efficient than modifying each element as a set.\n  However, this optimization can only be used when the elements of the unordered\n  set are atomic or ordered sets. It must also be the case that the type of the\n  elements matches some clause of Fun (the type of the created set is the result\n  of applying Fun to the type of the given set), and that Fun does nothing but\n  selecting, duplicating, or rearranging parts of the elements.\n- Specifying a SetFun as an integer I is equivalent to specifying\n  `{external, fun(X) -> element(I, X) end}`, but is to be preferred, as it makes\n  it possible to handle this case even more efficiently.\n\nExamples of valid SetFuns:\n\n```erlang\nfun sofs:union/1\nfun(S) -> sofs:partition(1, S) end\nfun(S) -> sofs:from_term(sofs:no_elements(S)) end\n{external, fun(A) -> A end}\n{external, fun({A,_,C}) -> {C,A} end}\n{external, fun({_,{_,C}}) -> C end}\n{external, fun({_,{_,{_,E}=C}}) -> {E,{E,C}} end}\n2\n```\n\nExamples of invalid SetFuns:\n\n```erlang\nfun sofs:no_elements/1\n{external, fun(A) -> 2 * A end}\n{external, fun({A,B,C}) -> A + B + C end}\n{external, fun lists:sum/1}\n```\n\nThe order in which a SetFun is applied to the elements of an unordered set is\nnot specified, and can change in future versions of this module.\n\nThe execution time of the functions of this module is dominated by the time it\ntakes to sort lists. When no sorting is needed, the execution time is in the\nworst case proportional to the sum of the sizes of the input arguments and the\nreturned value. A few functions execute in constant time: `from_external/2`,\n`is_empty_set/1`, `is_set/1`, `is_sofs_set/1`, `to_external/1` `type/1`.\n\nThe functions of this module exit the process with a `badarg`, `bad_function`,\nor `type_mismatch` message when given badly formed arguments or sets the types\nof which are not compatible.\n\nWhen comparing external sets, operator `==/2` is used.","ref":"sofs.html#module-sets-handled-by-this-module"},{"type":"module","title":"See Also - sofs","doc":"`m:digraph`, `m:gb_sets`, `m:gb_trees`, `m:maps`, `m:orddict`, `m:ordsets`, `m:sets`","ref":"sofs.html#module-see-also"},{"type":"type","title":"sofs.a_function/0","doc":"A [function](`m:sofs#function`).","ref":"sofs.html#t:a_function/0"},{"type":"function","title":"sofs.a_function/1","doc":"Equivalent to  a_function(Tuples, [{atom, atom}]) .","ref":"sofs.html#a_function/1"},{"type":"function","title":"sofs.a_function/2","doc":"Creates a [function](`m:sofs#function`).\n\n[`a_function(F, T)`](`a_function/2`) is equivalent to\n[`from_term(F, T)`](`from_term/2`) if the result is a function.","ref":"sofs.html#a_function/2"},{"type":"function","title":"Examples - sofs.a_function/2","doc":"```erlang\n1> sofs:is_a_function(sofs:a_function([{1,a},{2,b},{3,c}])).\ntrue\n2> sofs:a_function([{1,a},{1,b}]).\n** exception error: bad_function\n     in function  sofs:a_function/1\n```","ref":"sofs.html#a_function/2-examples"},{"type":"opaque","title":"sofs.a_set/0","doc":"An [unordered set](`m:sofs#module-sets-handled-by-this-module`).","ref":"sofs.html#t:a_set/0"},{"type":"type","title":"sofs.anyset/0","doc":"Any kind of set (also included are the atomic sets).","ref":"sofs.html#t:anyset/0"},{"type":"type","title":"sofs.binary_relation/0","doc":"A [binary relation](`m:sofs#binary_relation`).","ref":"sofs.html#t:binary_relation/0"},{"type":"function","title":"sofs.canonical_relation/1","doc":"Returns the binary relation containing the elements (E, Set) such that Set\nbelongs to `SetOfSets` and E belongs to Set.\n\nIf `SetOfSets` is a [partition](`m:sofs#partition`) of a set X and R is the\nequivalence relation in X induced by `SetOfSets`, then the returned relation is the\n[canonical map](`m:sofs#canonical_map`) from X onto the equivalence classes with\nrespect to R.","ref":"sofs.html#canonical_relation/1"},{"type":"function","title":"Examples - sofs.canonical_relation/1","doc":"```erlang\n1> Ss = sofs:from_term([[a,b],[b,c]]).\n2> CR = sofs:canonical_relation(Ss).\n3> sofs:to_external(CR).\n[{a,[a,b]},{b,[a,b]},{b,[b,c]},{c,[b,c]}]\n```","ref":"sofs.html#canonical_relation/1-examples"},{"type":"function","title":"sofs.composite/2","doc":"Returns the [composite](`m:sofs#composite`) of the functions `Function1` and\n`Function2`.","ref":"sofs.html#composite/2"},{"type":"function","title":"Examples - sofs.composite/2","doc":"```erlang\n1> F1 = sofs:a_function([{a,1},{b,2},{c,2}]).\n2> F2 = sofs:a_function([{1,x},{2,y},{3,z}]).\n3> F = sofs:composite(F1, F2).\n4> sofs:to_external(F).\n[{a,x},{b,y},{c,y}]\n5> sofs:composite(F2, F1).\n** exception error: bad_function\n     in function  sofs:composite/2\n```","ref":"sofs.html#composite/2-examples"},{"type":"function","title":"sofs.constant_function/2","doc":"Creates the [function](`m:sofs#function`) that maps each element of set `Set`\nonto `AnySet`.","ref":"sofs.html#constant_function/2"},{"type":"function","title":"Examples - sofs.constant_function/2","doc":"```erlang\n1> S = sofs:set([a,b]).\n2> E = sofs:from_term(1).\n3> R = sofs:constant_function(S, E).\n4> sofs:to_external(R).\n[{a,1},{b,1}]\n```","ref":"sofs.html#constant_function/2-examples"},{"type":"function","title":"sofs.converse/1","doc":"Returns the [converse](`m:sofs#converse`) of the binary relation `BinRel1`.\n\nSee `inverse/1` for a similar function that applies only to invertible\nfunctions.","ref":"sofs.html#converse/1"},{"type":"function","title":"Examples - sofs.converse/1","doc":"```erlang\n1> R1 = sofs:relation([{1,a},{2,b},{3,a}]).\n2> R2 = sofs:converse(R1).\n3> sofs:to_external(R2).\n[{a,1},{a,3},{b,2}]\n```","ref":"sofs.html#converse/1-examples"},{"type":"function","title":"sofs.difference/2","doc":"Returns the [difference](`m:sofs#difference`) of the sets `Set1` and `Set2`.","ref":"sofs.html#difference/2"},{"type":"function","title":"Examples - sofs.difference/2","doc":"```erlang\n1> S0 = sofs:set([a,b,c,d]).\n2> S1 = sofs:set([c,d,e,f]).\n3> sofs:to_external(sofs:difference(S0, S1)).\n[a,b]\n4> sofs:to_external(sofs:difference(S1, S0)).\n[e,f]\n```","ref":"sofs.html#difference/2-examples"},{"type":"function","title":"sofs.digraph_to_family/1","doc":"Equivalent to  digraph_to_family(Graph, [{atom, [atom]}]) .","ref":"sofs.html#digraph_to_family/1"},{"type":"function","title":"sofs.digraph_to_family/2","doc":"Creates a [family](`m:sofs#family`) from the directed graph `Graph`.\n\nEach vertex a of `Graph` is represented by a pair\n(a, \\{b\\[1], ..., b\\[n]\\}), where the b\\[i]:s are the out-neighbors of\na.

Time is universal when it reflects the time at longitude zero,\nwithout any adjustment for daylight saving. Universal Coordinated Time (UTC)\ntime is also called Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).\n\nThe time functions `local_time/0` and `universal_time/0` in this module both\nreturn date and time. This is because separate functions for date and time can\nresult in a date/time combination that is displaced by 24 hours. This occurs if\none of the functions is called before midnight, and the other after midnight.\nThis problem also applies to the Erlang BIFs `date/0` and `time/0`, and their\nuse is strongly discouraged if a reliable date/time stamp is required.\n\nAll dates conform to the Gregorian calendar. This calendar was introduced by\nPope Gregory XIII in 1582 and was used in all Catholic countries from this year.\nProtestant parts of Germany and the Netherlands adopted it in 1698, England\nfollowed in 1752, and Russia in 1918 (the October revolution of 1917 took place\nin November according to the Gregorian calendar).\n\nThe Gregorian calendar in this module is extended back to year 0. For a given\ndate, the _gregorian days_ is the number of days up to and including the date\nspecified. Similarly, the _gregorian seconds_ for a specified date and time is\nthe number of seconds up to and including the specified date and time.\n\nFor computing differences between epochs in time, use the functions counting\ngregorian days or seconds. If epochs are specified as local time, they must be\nconverted to universal time to get the correct value of the elapsed time between\nepochs. Use of function [`time_difference/2`](`time_difference/2`) is\ndiscouraged.\n\nDifferent definitions exist for the week of the year. This module contains a\nweek of the year implementation conforming to the ISO 8601 standard. As the week\nnumber for a specified date can fall on the previous, the current, or on the\nnext year, it is important to specify both the year and the week number.\nFunctions `iso_week_number/0` and [`iso_week_number/1`](`iso_week_number/1`)\nreturn a tuple of the year and the week number.","ref":"calendar.html"},{"type":"module","title":"Leap Years - calendar","doc":"The notion that every fourth year is a leap year is not completely true.

Optional arguments do not have specific order and may appear\nanywhere in the command line. Positional arguments are ordered the same way as\nthey appear in the arguments list of the command specification.\n\nBy default, all positional arguments must be present in the command line. The\nparser will return an error otherwise. Options, however, may be omitted, in\nwhich case resulting argument map will either contain the default value, or not\nhave the key at all.\n\n- **`name`** - Sets the argument name in the parsed argument map. If `help` is\n  not defined, name is also used to generate the default usage message.\n\n- **`short`** - Defines a short (single character) form of an optional argument.\n\n  ```erlang\n  %% Define a command accepting argument named myarg, with short form $a:\n  1> Cmd = #{arguments => [#{name => myarg, short => $a}]}.\n  %% Parse command line \"-a str\":\n  2> {ok, ArgMap, _, _} = argparse:parse([\"-a\", \"str\"], Cmd), ArgMap.\n\n  #{myarg => \"str\"}\n\n  %% Option value can be concatenated with the switch: \"-astr\"\n  3> {ok, ArgMap, _, _} = argparse:parse([\"-astr\"], Cmd), ArgMap.\n\n  #{myarg => \"str\"}\n  ```\n\n  By default all options expect a single value following the option switch. The\n  only exception is an option of a boolean type.\n\n- **`long`** - Defines a long form of an optional argument.\n\n  ```erlang\n  1> Cmd = #{arguments => [#{name => myarg, long => \"name\"}]}.\n  %% Parse command line \"-name Erlang\":\n  2> {ok, ArgMap, _, _} = argparse:parse([\"-name\", \"Erlang\"], Cmd), ArgMap.\n\n  #{myarg => \"Erlang\"}\n  %% Or use \"=\" to separate the switch and the value:\n  3> {ok, ArgMap, _, _} = argparse:parse([\"-name=Erlang\"], Cmd), ArgMap.\n\n  #{myarg => \"Erlang\"}\n  ```\n\n  If neither `short` not `long` is defined, the argument is treated as\n  positional.\n\n- **`required`** - Forces the parser to expect the argument to be present in the\n  command line. By default, all positional argument are required, and all\n  options are not.\n\n- **`default`** - Specifies the default value to put in the parsed argument map\n  if the value is not supplied in the command line.\n\n  ```erlang\n  1> argparse:parse([], #{arguments => [#{name => myarg, short => $m}]}).\n\n  {ok,#{}, ...\n  2> argparse:parse([], #{arguments => [#{name => myarg, short => $m, default => \"def\"}]}).\n\n  {ok,#{myarg => \"def\"}, ...\n  ```\n\n- **`type`** - Defines type conversion and validation routine. The default is\n  `string`, assuming no conversion.\n\n- **`nargs`** - Defines the number of following arguments to consume from the\n  command line. By default, the parser consumes the next argument and converts\n  it into an Erlang term according to the specified type.\n\n  - **`t:pos_integer/0`** - Consume exactly this number of positional arguments,\n    fail if there is not enough. Value in the argument map contains a list of\n    exactly this length. Example, defining a positional argument expecting 3\n    integer values:\n\n    ```erlang\n    1> Cmd = #{arguments => [#{name => ints, type => integer, nargs => 3}]},\n    argparse:parse([\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"], Cmd).\n\n    {ok, #{ints => [1, 2, 3]}, ...\n    ```\n\n    Another example defining an option accepted as `-env` and expecting two\n    string arguments:\n\n    ```erlang\n    1> Cmd = #{arguments => [#{name => env, long => \"env\", nargs => 2}]},\n    argparse:parse([\"-env\", \"key\", \"value\"], Cmd).\n\n    {ok, #{env => [\"key\", \"value\"]}, ...\n    ```\n\n  - **`list`** - Consume all following arguments until hitting the next option\n    (starting with an option prefix). May result in an empty list added to the\n    arguments map.\n\n    ```erlang\n    1> Cmd = #{arguments => [\n      #{name => nodes, long => \"nodes\", nargs => list},\n      #{name => verbose, short => $v, type => boolean}\n    ]},\n    argparse:parse([\"-nodes\", \"one\", \"two\", \"-v\"], Cmd).\n\n    {ok, #{nodes => [\"one\", \"two\"], verbose => true}, ...\n    ```\n\n  - **`nonempty_list`** - Same as `list`, but expects at least one argument.\n    Returns an error if the following command line argument is an option switch\n    (starting with the prefix).\n\n  - **`'maybe'`** - Consumes the next argument from the command line, if it does\n    not start with an option prefix. Otherwise, adds a default value to the\n    arguments map.\n\n    ```erlang\n    1> Cmd = #{arguments => [\n      #{name => level, short => $l, nargs => 'maybe', default => \"error\"},\n      #{name => verbose, short => $v, type => boolean}\n    ]},\n    argparse:parse([\"-l\", \"info\", \"-v\"], Cmd).\n\n    {ok,#{level => \"info\",verbose => true}, ...\n\n    %% When \"info\" is omitted, argument maps receives the default \"error\"\n    2> argparse:parse([\"-l\", \"-v\"], Cmd).\n\n    {ok,#{level => \"error\",verbose => true}, ...\n    ```\n\n  - **`{'maybe', term()}`** - Consumes the next argument from the command line,\n    if it does not start with an option prefix. Otherwise, adds a specified\n    Erlang term to the arguments map.\n\n  - **`all`** - Fold all remaining command line arguments into a list, ignoring\n    any option prefixes or switches. Useful for proxying arguments into another\n    command line utility.\n\n    ```erlang\n    1> Cmd = #{arguments => [\n        #{name => verbose, short => $v, type => boolean},\n        #{name => raw, long => \"-\", nargs => all}\n    ]},\n    argparse:parse([\"-v\", \"--\", \"-kernel\", \"arg\", \"opt\"], Cmd).\n\n    {ok,#{raw => [\"-kernel\",\"arg\",\"opt\"],verbose => true}, ...\n    ```\n\n- **`action`** - Defines an action to take when the argument is found in the\n  command line. The default action is `store`.\n\n  - **`store`** - Store the value in the arguments map. Overwrites the value\n    previously written.\n\n    ```erlang\n    1> Cmd = #{arguments => [#{name => str, short => $s}]},\n    argparse:parse([\"-s\", \"one\", \"-s\", \"two\"], Cmd).\n\n    {ok, #{str => \"two\"}, ...\n    ```\n\n  - **`{store, term()}`** - Stores the specified term instead of reading the\n    value from the command line.\n\n    ```erlang\n    1> Cmd = #{arguments => [#{name => str, short => $s, action => {store, \"two\"}}]},\n    argparse:parse([\"-s\"], Cmd).\n\n    {ok, #{str => \"two\"}, ...\n    ```\n\n  - **`append`** - Appends the repeating occurrences of the argument instead of\n    overwriting.\n\n    ```erlang\n    1> Cmd = #{arguments => [#{name => node, short => $n, action => append}]},\n    argparse:parse([\"-n\", \"one\", \"-n\", \"two\", \"-n\", \"three\"], Cmd).\n\n    {ok, #{node => [\"one\", \"two\", \"three\"]}, ...\n\n    %% Always produces a list - even if there is one occurrence\n    2> argparse:parse([\"-n\", \"one\"], Cmd).\n\n    {ok, #{node => [\"one\"]}, ...\n    ```\n\n  - **`{append, term()}`** - Same as `append`, but instead of consuming the\n    argument from the command line, appends a provided `t:term/0`.\n\n  - **`count`** - Puts a counter as a value in the arguments map. Useful for\n    implementing verbosity option:\n\n    ```erlang\n    1> Cmd = #{arguments => [#{name => verbose, short => $v, action => count}]},\n    argparse:parse([\"-v\"], Cmd).\n\n    {ok, #{verbose => 1}, ...\n\n    2> argparse:parse([\"-vvvv\"], Cmd).\n\n    {ok, #{verbose => 4}, ...\n    ```\n\n  - **`extend`** - Works as `append`, but flattens the resulting list. Valid\n    only for `nargs` set to `list`, `nonempty_list`, `all` or `t:pos_integer/0`.\n\n    ```erlang\n    1> Cmd = #{arguments => [#{name => duet, short => $d, nargs => 2, action => extend}]},\n    argparse:parse([\"-d\", \"a\", \"b\", \"-d\", \"c\", \"d\"], Cmd).\n\n    {ok, #{duet => [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"]}, ...\n\n    %% 'append' would result in {ok, #{duet => [[\"a\", \"b\"],[\"c\", \"d\"]]},\n    ```\n\n- **`help`** - Specifies help/usage text for the argument. `argparse` provides\n  automatic generation based on the argument name, type and default value, but\n  for better usability it is recommended to have a proper description. Setting\n  this field to `hidden` suppresses usage output for this argument.","ref":"argparse.html#t:argument/0"},{"type":"type","title":"argparse.argument_help/0","doc":"User-defined help template to print in the command usage.

The node\nspawning new nodes is called _origin_, and newly started nodes are _peer_ nodes,\nor peers. A peer node automatically terminates when it loses the _control\nconnection_ to the origin. This connection could be an Erlang distribution\nconnection, or an alternative - TCP or standard I/O. The alternative connection\nprovides a way to execute remote procedure calls even when Erlang Distribution\nis not available, allowing to test the distribution itself.\n\nPeer node terminal input/output is relayed through the origin. If a standard I/O\nalternative connection is requested, console output also goes via the origin,\nallowing debugging of node startup and boot script execution (see\n[`-init_debug`](`e:erts:erl_cmd.md#init_debug`)). File I/O is not redirected,\ncontrary to `m:slave` behaviour.\n\nThe peer node can start on the same or a different host (via `ssh`) or in a\nseparate container (for example Docker). When the peer starts on the same host\nas the origin, it inherits the current directory and environment variables from\nthe origin.\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> This module is designed to facilitate multi-node testing with Common Test. Use\n> the `?CT_PEER()` macro to start a linked peer node according to Common Test\n> conventions: crash dumps written to specific location, node name prefixed with\n> module name, calling function, and origin OS process ID). Use `random_name/1`\n> to create sufficiently unique node names if you need more control.\n>\n> A peer node started without alternative connection behaves similarly to\n> `m:slave`. When an alternative connection is requested, the behaviour is\n> similar to `test_server:start_node(Name, peer, Args).`","ref":"peer.html"},{"type":"module","title":"Example - peer","doc":"The following example implements a test suite starting extra Erlang nodes. It\nemploys a number of techniques to speed up testing and reliably shut down peer\nnodes:\n\n- peers start linked to test runner process. If the test case fails, the peer\n  node is stopped automatically, leaving no rogue nodes running in the\n  background\n- arguments used to start the peer are saved in the control process state for\n  manual analysis. If the test case fails, the CRASH REPORT contains these\n  arguments\n- multiple test cases can run concurrently speeding up overall testing process,\n  peer node names are unique even when there are multiple instances of the same\n  test suite running in parallel\n\n```erlang\n-module(my_SUITE).\n-behaviour(ct_suite).\n-export([all/0, groups/0]).\n-export([basic/1, args/1, named/1, restart_node/1, multi_node/1]).\n\n-include_lib(\"common_test/include/ct.hrl\").\n\ngroups() ->\n    [{quick, [parallel],\n        [basic, args, named, restart_node, multi_node]}].\n\nall() ->\n    [{group, quick}].\n\nbasic(Config) when is_list(Config) ->\n    {ok, Peer, _Node} = ?CT_PEER(),\n    peer:stop(Peer).\n\nargs(Config) when is_list(Config) ->\n    %% specify additional arguments to the new node\n    {ok, Peer, _Node} = ?CT_PEER([\"-emu_flavor\", \"smp\"]),\n    peer:stop(Peer).\n\nnamed(Config) when is_list(Config) ->\n    %% pass test case name down to function starting nodes\n    Peer = start_node_impl(named_test),\n    peer:stop(Peer).\n\nstart_node_impl(ActualTestCase) ->\n    {ok, Peer, Node} = ?CT_PEER(#{name => ?CT_PEER_NAME(ActualTestCase)}),\n    %% extra setup needed for multiple test cases\n    ok = rpc:call(Node, application, set_env, [kernel, key, value]),\n    Peer.\n\nrestart_node(Config) when is_list(Config) ->\n    Name = ?CT_PEER_NAME(),\n    {ok, Peer, Node} = ?CT_PEER(#{name => Name}),\n    peer:stop(Peer),\n    %% restart the node with the same name as before\n    {ok, Peer2, Node} = ?CT_PEER(#{name => Name, args => [\"+fnl\"]}),\n    peer:stop(Peer2).\n```\n\nThe next example demonstrates how to start multiple nodes concurrently:\n\n```erlang\nmulti_node(Config) when is_list(Config) ->\n    Peers = [?CT_PEER(#{wait_boot => {self(), tag}})\n        || _ <- lists:seq(1, 4)],\n    %% wait for all nodes to complete boot process, get their names:\n    _Nodes = [receive {tag, {started, Node, Peer}} -> Node end\n        || {ok, Peer} <- Peers],\n    [peer:stop(Peer) || {ok, Peer} <- Peers].\n```\n\nStart a peer on a different host.

When `name` is not specified,\n  but `host` is, `peer` follows compatibility behaviour and uses the origin node\n  name.\n\n- **`longnames`** - Use long names to start a node. Default is taken from the\n  origin using `net_kernel:longnames()`. If the origin is not distributed, short\n  names is the default.\n\n- **`host`** - Enforces a specific host name.

When set to `stop` (default), a lost control\n  connection causes the control process to exit normally. Setting `peer_down` to\n  `continue` keeps the control process running, and `crash` will cause the\n  controlling process to exit abnormally.\n\n- **`connection`** - Alternative connection specification. See the\n  [`connection` datatype](`t:connection/0`).\n\n- **`exec`** - Alternative mechanism to start peer nodes with, for example, ssh\n  instead of the default bash.\n\n- **`detached`** - Defines whether to pass the `-detached` flag to the started\n  peer.

It is\nessentially a port driver wrapped around the Win32 API calls for accessing the\nregistry.\n\nThe registry is a hierarchical database, used to store various system and\nsoftware information in Windows. It contains installation data, and is updated\nby installers and system programs. The Erlang installer updates the registry by\nadding data that Erlang needs.\n\nThe registry contains keys and values. Keys are like the directories in a file\nsystem, they form a hierarchy. Values are like files, they have a name and a\nvalue, and also a type.\n\nPaths to keys are left to right, with subkeys to the right and backslash between\nkeys. (Remember that backslashes must be doubled in Erlang strings.) Case is\npreserved but not significant.\n\nFor example, `\"\\\\hkey_local_machine\\\\software\\\\Ericsson\\\\Erlang\\\\5.0\"` is the\nkey for the installation data for the latest Erlang release.\n\nThere are six entry points in the Windows registry, top-level keys. They can be\nabbreviated in this module as follows:\n\n```text\nAbbreviation     Registry key\n============     ============\nhkcr             HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ncurrent_user     HKEY_CURRENT_USER\nhkcu             HKEY_CURRENT_USER\nlocal_machine    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\nhklm             HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\nusers            HKEY_USERS\nhku              HKEY_USERS\ncurrent_config   HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG\nhkcc             HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG\ndyn_data         HKEY_DYN_DATA\nhkdd             HKEY_DYN_DATA\n```\n\nThe key above can be written as `\"\\\\hklm\\\\software\\\\ericsson\\\\erlang\\\\5.0\"`.\n\nThis module uses a current key. It works much like the current directory. From\nthe current key, values can be fetched, subkeys can be listed, and so on.\n\nUnder a key, any number of named values can be stored. They have names, types,\nand data.\n\n`win32reg` supports storing of the following types:\n\n- `REG_DWORD`, which is an integer\n- `REG_SZ`, which is a string\n- `REG_BINARY`, which is a binary\n\nOther types can be read, and are returned as binaries.\n\nThere is also a \"default\" value, which has the empty string as name. It is read\nand written with the atom `default` instead of the name.\n\nSome registry values are stored as strings with references to environment\nvariables, for example, `%SystemRoot%Windows`. `SystemRoot` is an environment\nvariable, and is to be replaced with its value.

It also fits into an OTP supervision tree.\nFor more information, see [gen_event section in OTP Design Principles](`e:system:events.md`).\n\nEach event handler is implemented as a callback module\nexporting a predefined set of functions. The relationship between\nthe behavior functions and the callback functions is as follows:\n\n```text\ngen_event module                   Callback module\n----------------                   ---------------\ngen_event:start\ngen_event:start_monitor\ngen_event:start_link       ----->  -\n\ngen_event:add_handler\ngen_event:add_sup_handler  ----->  Module:init/1\n\ngen_event:notify\ngen_event:sync_notify      ----->  Module:handle_event/2\n\ngen_event:send_request\ngen_event:call             ----->  Module:handle_call/2\n\n-                          ----->  Module:handle_info/2\n\ngen_event:delete_handler   ----->  Module:terminate/2\n\ngen_event:swap_handler\ngen_event:swap_sup_handler ----->  Module1:terminate/2\n                                   Module2:init/1\n\ngen_event:which_handlers   ----->  -\n\ngen_event:stop             ----->  Module:terminate/2\n\n-                          ----->  Module:code_change/3\n```\n\nAs each event handler is one callback module, an event manager\nhas many callback modules that are added and deleted dynamically.\n`gen_event` is therefore more tolerant of callback module errors\nthan the other behaviors.  If a callback function for an installed\nevent handler fails with `Reason`, or returns a bad value `Term`,\nthe event manager does not fail.  It deletes the event handler\nby calling callback function [`Module:terminate/2`](`c:terminate/2`),\ngiving as argument `{error, {'EXIT', Reason}}` or `{error, Term}`,\nrespectively.  No other event handler is affected.\n\nA `gen_event` process handles system messages as described in `m:sys`.\nThe `sys` module can be used for debugging an event manager.\n\nNotice that an event manager _does_ trap exit signals automatically.\n\nThe `gen_event` process can go into hibernation\n(see `erlang:hibernate/3`) if a callback function in a handler module\nspecifies `hibernate` in its return value.  This can be useful\nif the server is expected to be idle for a long time.\nHowever, use this feature with care, as hibernation implies\nat least two garbage collections (when hibernating\nand shortly after waking up) and is not something you want to do\nbetween each event handled by a busy event manager.\n\nNotice that when multiple event handlers are invoked,\nit is sufficient that one single event handler returns a `hibernate`\nrequest for the whole event manager to go into hibernation.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, all functions in this module fail\nif the specified event manager does not exist\nor if bad arguments are specified.\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> For some important information about distributed signals, see the\n> [_Blocking Signaling Over Distribution_\n> ](`e:system:ref_man_processes.md#blocking-signaling-over-distribution`)\n> section in the _Processes_ chapter of the _Erlang Reference Manual_.\n> Blocking signaling can, for example, cause call timeouts in `gen_event`\n> to be significantly delayed.","ref":"gen_event.html"},{"type":"behaviour","title":"See Also - gen_event","doc":"`m:supervisor`, `m:sys`","ref":"gen_event.html#module-see-also"},{"type":"function","title":"gen_event.add_handler/3","doc":"Add a new event handler to an event manager.\n\nThe new event handler is added to event manager `EventMgrRef`.\nThe event manager calls [`Module:init/1`](`c:init/1`)\nto initiate the event handler and its internal state.\n\n`Handler` is the name of the callback module `Module`\nor a tuple `{Module, Id}`, where `Id` is any term.\nThe `{Module, Id}` representation makes it possible to\nidentify a specific event handler, when many event handlers\nuse the same callback module.\n\n`Args` is any term that is passed as the argument to\n[`Module:init/1`](`c:init/1`).\n\nIf [`Module:init/1`](`c:init/1`) returns a correct value\nindicating successful completion, the event manager\nadds the event handler and this function returns `ok`.\nIf [`Module:init/1`](`c:init/1`) fails with `Reason` or returns\n`{error,Reason}`, the event handler is ignored and this function\nreturns `{'EXIT',Reason}` or `{error,Reason}`, respectively.","ref":"gen_event.html#add_handler/3"},{"type":"type","title":"gen_event.add_handler_ret/0","doc":"","ref":"gen_event.html#t:add_handler_ret/0"},{"type":"function","title":"gen_event.add_sup_handler/3","doc":"Add a new event handler to an event manager, supervised.\n\nThe new event handler is added as for `add_handler/3`,\nbut the event manager also supervises the connection\nby linking the event handler and the calling process.\n\n- If the calling process later terminates with `Reason`,\n  the event manager deletes any supervised event handlers by calling\n  [`Module:terminate/2`](`c:terminate/2`), then calls\n  [`Module:handle_info/2`](`c:handle_info/2`) for each remaining handler.\n\n- If the event handler is deleted later, the event manager\n  sends a message `{gen_event_EXIT,Handler,Reason}`\n  to the calling process. `Reason` is one of the following:\n\n  + `normal`, if the event handler has been removed because of\n    a call to [`delete_handler/3`](`delete_handler/3`),\n    or `remove_handler` has been returned by a callback function\n    (see below).\n  + `shutdown`, if the event handler has been removed\n    because the event manager is terminating.\n  + `{swapped, NewHandler, Pid}`, if the process `Pid` has replaced\n    the event handler with another event handler `NewHandler`,\n    through a call to `swap_handler/3` or `swap_sup_handler/3`.\n  + Other `t:term/0`, if the event handler is removed\n    because of an error.

This reference manual focuses on\n> being correct and complete, which might make it hard to see\n> the forest for all the trees.\n\n#### Features\n\n`gen_statem` has got the same features that `m:gen_fsm` had\nand adds some really useful:\n\n- [Co-located state code](#state_functions)\n- [Arbitrary term state](#handle_event_function)\n- [Event postponing](#event-postponing)\n- [Self-generated events](#event-insertion)\n- [State time-out](`t:state_timeout/0`)\n- [Multiple generic named time-outs](`t:generic_timeout/0`)\n- [Absolute time-out time](`t:timeout_option/0`)\n- [Automatic state enter calls](#state-enter-calls)\n- [Reply from other state than the request](#reply-to-a-call),\n  traceable with `m:sys`\n- [Multiple replies](#reply-to-a-call), traceable with `m:sys`\n- [Changing the callback module](#change_callback_module)\n\nTwo [_callback modes_](`t:callback_mode/0`) are supported:\n\n- `state_functions` - for finite-state machines (`m:gen_fsm` like),\n  which requires the state to be an atom and uses that state\n  as the name of the current callback function, arity 3.\n- `handle_event_function` - that allows the state to be any term\n  and that uses `c:handle_event/4` as callback function for all states.\n\nThe callback modes for `gen_statem` differs from the one for\n`gen_fsm`, but it is still fairly easy to\nrewrite from `gen_fsm` to `gen_statem`.  See the\n[rewrite guide](`m:gen_fsm#module-migration-to-gen_statem`)\nat the start of the `m:gen_fsm` documentation.\n\n#### Callback module\n\nA `gen_statem` assumes all specific parts to be located\nin a callback module exporting a predefined set of functions.\nThe relationship between the behavior functions\nand the callback functions is as follows:\n\n```\ngen_statem module            Callback module\n-----------------            ---------------\ngen_statem:start\ngen_statem:start_monitor\ngen_statem:start_link -----> Module:init/1\n\nServer start or code change\n                      -----> Module:callback_mode/0\n                      selects callback mode\n\ngen_statem:stop\nSupervisor exit\nCallback failure      -----> Module:terminate/3\n\ngen_statem:call\ngen_statem:cast\ngen_statem:send_request\nerlang:send\nerlang:'!'            -----> Module:StateName/3\n                   or -----> Module:handle_event/4\n                   depending on callback mode\n\nRelease upgrade/downgrade\n(code change)\n                      -----> Module:code_change/4\n```\n\n#### State callback {: #state-callback }\n\nThe _state callback_ for a specific [state](`t:state/0`) in a `gen_statem`\nis the callback function that is called for all events in this state.\nIt is selected depending on which [_callback mode_](`t:callback_mode/0`)\nthat the callback module defines with the callback function\n[`Module:callback_mode/0`](`c:callback_mode/0`).\n\n[](){: #state_functions }\nWhen the [_callback mode_](`t:callback_mode/0`) is `state_functions`,\nthe state must be an atom and is used as the _state callback_ name;\nsee [`Module:StateName/3`](`c:'StateName'/3`).  This co-locates all code\nfor a specific state in one function as the `gen_statem` engine branches\ndepending on state name.  Note the fact that the callback function\n[`Module:terminate/3`](`c:terminate/3`) makes the state name `terminate`\nunusable in this mode.\n\n[](){: #handle_event_function }\nWhen the [_callback mode_](`t:callback_mode/0`) is `handle_event_function`,\nthe state can be any term and the _state callback_ name is\n[`Module:handle_event/4`](`c:handle_event/4`). This makes it easy\nto branch depending on state or event as you desire. Be careful about\nwhich events you handle in which states so that you do not accidentally\npostpone an event forever creating an infinite busy loop.\n\n#### Event types\n\nEvents are of different [types](`t:event_type/0`),\ntherefore the callback functions can know the origin of an event\nwhen handling it.  [External events](`t:external_event_type/0`) are\n`call`,  `cast`, and  `info`. Internal events are\n[`timeout`](`t:timeout_event_type/0`) and `internal`.\n\n#### Event handling\n\nWhen `gen_statem` receives a process message it is transformed\ninto an event and the [_state callback_](#state-callback)\nis called with the event as two arguments: type and content. When the\n[_state callback_](#state-callback) has processed the event\nit returns to `gen_statem` which does a _state transition_. If this\n_state transition_ is to a different state, that is: `NextState =/= State`,\nit is a _state change_.\n\n#### Transition actions\n\nThe [_state callback_](#state-callback) may return\n[_transition actions_](`t:action/0`) for `gen_statem` to execute\nduring the _state transition_, for example to set a time-out\nor reply to a call.\n\n#### Reply to a call {: #reply-to-a-call }\n\nSee [`gen_statem:call/2,3`](#call-reply) about how to reply\nto a call.  A reply can be sent from any _state callback_,\nnot just the one that got the request event.\n\n#### Event postponing {: #event-postponing }\n\nOne of the possible _transition actions_ is to postpone the current event.\nThen it will not be handled in the current state.  The `gen_statem` engine\nkeeps a queue of events divided into postponed events and\nevents still to process (not presented yet).  After a _state change_\nthe queue restarts with the postponed events.\n\nThe `gen_statem` event queue model is sufficient to emulate\nthe normal process message queue with selective receive.\nPostponing an event corresponds to not matching it\nin a receive statement, and changing states corresponds to\nentering a new receive statement.\n\n#### Event insertion {: #event-insertion }\n\nThe [_state callback_](#state-callback) can insert\nevents using the [_transition action_](`t:action/0`) `next_event`,\nand such an event is inserted in the event queue as the next to call the\n[_state callback_](#state-callback) with. That is,\nas if it is the oldest incoming event. A dedicated `t:event_type/0`\n`internal` can be used for such events making it possible to\nsafely distinguish them from external events.\n\nInserting an event replaces the trick of calling your own state handling\nfunctions that you often would have to resort to in, for example,\n`m:gen_fsm` to force processing an inserted event before others.\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> If you postpone an event and (against good practice) directly call\n> a different _state callback_, the postponed event is not retried,\n> since there was no _state change_.\n>\n> Instead of directly calling a _state callback_, do a _state change_.\n> This makes the `gen_statem` engine retry postponed events.\n>\n> Inserting an event in a _state change_ also triggers\n> the new  _state callback_ to be called with that event\n> before receiving any external events.\n\n#### State enter calls {: #state-enter-calls }\n\nThe `gen_statem` engine can automatically make a special call to the\n[_state callback_](#state-callback) whenever a new state is\nentered; see `t:state_enter/0`. This is for writing code common\nto all state entries.  Another way to do it is to explicitly insert\nan event at the _state transition_, and/or to use a dedicated\n_state transition_ function, but that is something you will have to\nremember at every _state transition_ to the state(s) that need it.\n\nFor the details of a _state transition_, see type `t:transition_option/0`.\n\n#### Hibernation\n\nThe `gen_statem` process can go into hibernation;\nsee `proc_lib:hibernate/3`. It is done when\na [_state callback_](#state-callback) or\n[`Module:init/1`](`c:init/1`) specifies `hibernate`\nin the returned [`Actions`](`t:enter_action/0`) list. This feature\ncan be useful to reclaim process heap memory while the server\nis expected to be idle for a long time. However, use it with care,\nas hibernation can be too costly to use after every event;\nsee `erlang:hibernate/3`.\n\nThere is also a server start option\n[`{hibernate_after, Timeout}`](`t:enter_loop_opt/0`)\nfor [`start/3,4`](`start/3`), [`start_link/3,4`](`start_link/3`),\n[`start_monitor/3,4`](`start_monitor/3`),\nor [`enter_loop/4,5,6`](`enter_loop/6`), that may be used\nto automatically hibernate the server.\n\n#### Callback failure\n\nIf a callback function fails or returns a bad value,\nthe `gen_statem` terminates.  However, an exception of class\n[`throw`](`erlang:throw/1`) is not regarded as an error\nbut as a valid return, from all callback functions.\n\n#### System messages and the `m:sys` module\n\nA `gen_statem` handles system messages as described in `m:sys`.\nThe `m:sys` module can be used for debugging a `gen_statem`.\nReplies sent through [_transition actions_](`t:action/0`)\ngets logged, but not replies sent through [`reply/1,2`](`reply/2`).\n\n#### Trapping exit\n\nA `gen_statem` process, like all `gen_`\\* behaviours,\ndoes not trap exit signals automatically;\nthis must be explicitly initiated in the callback module\n(by calling [`process_flag(trap_exit, true)`](`erlang:process_flag/2`)\npreferably from `c:init/1`.\n\n#### Server termination\n\nIf the `gen_statem` process terminates, e.g. as a result\nof a callback function returning `{stop, Reason}`, an exit signal\nwith this `Reason` is sent to linked processes and ports.\nSee [Processes](`e:system:ref_man_processes.md#errors`)\nin the Reference Manual for details regarding error handling\nusing exit signals.\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> For some important information about distributed signals, see the\n> [_Blocking Signaling Over Distribution_\n> ](`e:system:ref_man_processes.md#blocking-signaling-over-distribution`)\n> section in the _Processes_ chapter of the _Erlang Reference Manual_.\n> Blocking signaling can, for example, cause call time-outs in `gen_statem`\n> to be significantly delayed.\n\n#### Bad argument\n\nUnless otherwise stated, all functions in this module fail if the specified\n`gen_statem` does not exist or if bad arguments are specified.","ref":"gen_statem.html"},{"type":"behaviour","title":"Example - gen_statem","doc":"The following example shows a simple pushbutton model\nfor a toggling pushbutton implemented with\n[_callback mode_](`t:callback_mode/0`) `state_functions`.\nYou can push the button and it replies if it went on or off,\nand you can ask for a count of how many times it has been pushed\nto switch on.","ref":"gen_statem.html#module-example"},{"type":"behaviour","title":"Pushbutton State Diagram - gen_statem","doc":"```mermaid\n---\ntitle: Pushbutton State Diagram\n---\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*]  --> off\n    off  --> on  : push\\n* Increment count\\n* Reply 'on'\n    on   --> off : push\\n* Reply 'off'\n```\n\nNot shown in the state diagram:\n* The API function `push()` generates an event `push` of type `call`.\n* The API function `get_count()` generates an event `get_count`\n  of type `call` that is handled in all states by replying with\n  the current count value.\n* Unknown events are ignored and discarded.\n* There is boilerplate code for start, stop, terminate, code change,\n  init, to set the callback mode to `state_functions`, etc...","ref":"gen_statem.html#module-pushbutton-state-diagram"},{"type":"behaviour","title":"Pushbutton Code - gen_statem","doc":"The following is the complete callback module file `pushbutton.erl`:\n\n```erlang\n-module(pushbutton).\n-behaviour(gen_statem).\n\n-export([start/0,push/0,get_count/0,stop/0]).\n-export([terminate/3,code_change/4,init/1,callback_mode/0]).\n-export([on/3,off/3]).\n\nname() -> pushbutton_statem. % The registered server name\n\n%% API.

This is the default restart strategy.\n- `one_for_all` \\- If one child process terminates and is to be restarted, all\n  other child processes are terminated and then all child processes are\n  restarted.\n- `rest_for_one` \\- If one child process terminates and is to be restarted, the\n  'rest' of the child processes (that is, the child processes after the\n  terminated child process in the start order) are terminated. Then the\n  terminated child process and all child processes after it are restarted.\n- `simple_one_for_one` \\- A simplified `one_for_one` supervisor, where all child\n  processes are dynamically added instances of the same process type, that is,\n  running the same code.\n\n  Functions `delete_child/2` and `restart_child/2` are invalid for\n  `simple_one_for_one` supervisors and return `{error,simple_one_for_one}` if\n  the specified supervisor uses this restart strategy.\n\n  Function `terminate_child/2` can be used for children under\n  `simple_one_for_one` supervisors by specifying the child's `t:pid/0` as the\n  second argument. If instead the child specification identifier is used,\n  [`terminate_child/2`](`terminate_child/2`) return\n  `{error,simple_one_for_one}`.\n\n  As a `simple_one_for_one` supervisor can have many children, it shuts them all\n  down asynchronously. This means that the children do their cleanup in\n  parallel, and therefore the order in which they are stopped is not defined.\n\n#### Restart intensity and period\n\nTo prevent a supervisor from getting into an infinite loop of child process\nterminations and restarts, a _maximum restart intensity_ is defined using two\ninteger values specified with keys `intensity` and `period` in the above map.\nAssuming the values `MaxR` for `intensity` and `MaxT` for `period`, then, if\nmore than `MaxR` restarts occur within `MaxT` seconds, the supervisor terminates\nall child processes and then itself. The termination reason for the supervisor\nitself in that case will be `shutdown`. `intensity` defaults to `1` and `period`\ndefaults to `5`.\n\n#### Hibernate after\n\nIn order to save memory, a supervisor, like any other process, can go into\nhibernation. By default, a `simple_one_for_one` supervisor will never hibernate,\nas it is expected its children will come and go at potentially high rates.\nIn counterpart, other strategies rather expect children to be stable and\ntherefore will default to hibernating after a certain period of time of\ninactivity, in order to be responsive to bursts of restarts and save memory in\nperiods of stability. You can finetune this flag by setting `hibernate_after`,\nwhen for example the supervisor will be regularly queried for `which_child/1` or\nsimilar and hibernation is to be better controlled.\n\n[](){: #auto_shutdown }\n\n#### Automatic Shutdown\n\nA supervisor can be configured to automatically shut itself down with exit\nreason `shutdown` when [significant children](`m:supervisor#significant_child`)\nterminate with the `auto_shutdown` key in the above map:\n\n- `never` \\- Automic shutdown is disabled. This is the default setting.\n\n  With `auto_shutdown` set to `never`, child specs with the `significant` flag\n  set to `true` are considered invalid and will be rejected.\n\n- `any_significant` \\- The supervisor will shut itself down when _any_\n  significant child terminates, that is, when a `transient` significant child\n  terminates normally or when a `temporary` significant child terminates\n  normally or abnormally.\n- `all_significant` \\- The supervisor will shut itself down when _all_\n  significant children have terminated, that is, when the _last active_\n  significant child terminates. The same rules as for `any_significant` apply.\n\nFor more information, see the section\n[Automatic Shutdown](`e:system:sup_princ.md#automatic-shutdown`) in Supervisor\nBehavior in OTP Design Principles.\n\n> #### Warning {: .warning }\n>\n> The automatic shutdown feature appeared in OTP 24.0, but applications using\n> this feature will also compile and run with older OTP versions.\n>\n> However, such applications, when compiled with an OTP version that predates\n> the appearance of the automatic shutdown feature, will leak processes because\n> the automatic shutdowns they rely on will not happen.\n>\n> It is up to implementors to take proper precautions if they expect that their\n> applications may be compiled with older OTP versions.\n\n[](){: #child_spec }","ref":"supervisor.html#module-supervisor-flags"},{"type":"behaviour","title":"Child specification - supervisor","doc":"The type definition of a child specification is as follows:\n\n```erlang\nchild_spec() = #{id => child_id(),             % mandatory\n                 start => mfargs(),            % mandatory\n                 restart => restart(),         % optional\n                 significant => significant(), % optional\n                 shutdown => shutdown(),       % optional\n                 type => worker(),             % optional\n                 modules => modules()}         % optional\n```\n\nThe old tuple format is kept for backwards compatibility, see `t:child_spec/0`,\nbut the map is preferred.\n\n- `id` is used to identify the child specification internally by the supervisor.\n\n  The `id` key is mandatory.\n\n  Notice that this identifier on occations has been called \"name\".

The\nexpressions are evaluated and a value is returned. The shell provides an Emacs\nlike set of shortcuts for editing the text of the current line. See\n[tty - A Command-Line Interface](`e:erts:tty.md`) in the ERTS User's Guide for a\nlist of all available shortcuts. You may also change the shortcuts to suit your\npreferences more, see [edlin - line editor in the shell](`m:edlin`).\n\nA history mechanism saves previous commands and their values, which can then be\nincorporated in later commands. How many commands and results to save can be\ndetermined by the user, either interactively, by calling `history/1` and\n`results/1`, or by setting the application configuration parameters\n[`shell_history_length`](stdlib_app.md#shell_history_length) and\n[`shell_saved_results`](stdlib_app.md#shell_saved_results) for the STDLIB\napplication. The shell history can be saved to disk by setting the application\nconfiguration parameter\n[`shell_history`](`e:kernel:kernel_app.md#shell_history`) for the Kernel\napplication.\n\nThe shell uses a helper process for evaluating commands to protect the history\nmechanism from exceptions. By default the evaluator process is killed when an\nexception occurs, but by calling `catch_exception/1` or by setting the\napplication configuration parameter `shell_catch_exception` for the STDLIB\napplication this behavior can be changed. See also the example below.\n\nVariable bindings, and local process dictionary changes that are generated in\nuser expressions are preserved, and the variables can be used in later commands\nto access their values. The bindings can also be forgotten so the variables can\nbe reused.\n\nThe special shell commands all have the syntax of (local) function calls. They\nare evaluated as normal function calls and many commands can be used in one\nexpression sequence.\n\nIf a command (local function call) is not recognized by the shell, an attempt is\nfirst made to find the function in module `user_default`, where customized local\ncommands can be placed. If found, the function is evaluated, otherwise an\nattempt is made to evaluate the function in module `shell_default`. Module\n`user_default` must be explicitly loaded.\n\nThe shell also permits the user to start multiple concurrent jobs. A job can be\nregarded as a set of processes that can communicate with the shell.\n\nThere is some support for reading and printing records in the shell. During\ncompilation record expressions are translated to tuple expressions. In runtime\nit is not known whether a tuple represents a record, and the record definitions\nused by the compiler are unavailable at runtime. So, to read the record syntax\nand print tuples as records when possible, record definitions must be maintained\nby the shell itself.\n\nThe shell commands for reading, defining, forgetting, listing, and printing\nrecords are described below. Notice that each job has its own set of record\ndefinitions.

For a function with side effects, the result can be different.\n\nThe next few commands show some record manipulation.

The\nevaluation of the command fails, but the definition of `rec` has been carried\nout.\n\nFor the next command, it is assumed that `test1:loop(N)` is defined as follows:\n\n`loop(N) ->`  \n    `io:format(\"Hello Number: ~w~n\", [N]),`  \n    `loop(N+1).`\n\n```text\n41> test1:loop(0).\nHello Number: 0\nHello Number: 1\nHello Number: 2\nHello Number: 3\n\nUser switch command\n --> i\n --> c\n.\n.\n.\nHello Number: 3374\nHello Number: 3375\nHello Number: 3376\nHello Number: 3377\nHello Number: 3378\n** exception exit: killed\n```\n\nCommand 41 evaluates `test1:loop(0)`, which puts the system into an infinite\nloop. At this point the user types `^G` (Control G), which suspends output from\nthe current process, which is stuck in a loop, and activates `JCL` mode. In\n`JCL` mode the user can start and stop jobs.\n\nIn this particular case, command `i` (\"interrupt\") terminates the looping\nprogram, and command `c` connects to the shell again.

The\nexception handling can also be set when starting Erlang by\n`erl -stdlib shell_catch_exception true`.\n\n```erlang\n47> E = ets:new(t, []).\n#Ref<0.1662103692.2407923716.214197>\n48> ets:insert({d,1,2}).\n* exception error: undefined function ets:insert/1\n```\n\nCommand 48 makes the same mistake as in command 43, but this time the evaluator\nprocess lives on. The single star at the beginning of the printout signals that\nthe exception has been caught.\n\n```erlang\n49> ets:insert(E, {d,1,2}).\ntrue\n```\n\nCommand 49 successfully inserts the tuple into the ETS table.\n\n```erlang\n50> ets:insert(#Ref<0.1662103692.2407923716.214197>, {e,3,4}).\ntrue\n```\n\nCommand 50 inserts another tuple into the ETS table. This time the first\nargument is the table identifier itself. The shell can parse commands with pids\n(`<0.60.0>`), ports (`#Port<0.536>`), references\n(`#Ref<0.1662103692.2407792644.214210>`), and external functions\n(`#Fun `), but the command fails unless the corresponding pid, port,\nreference, or function can be created in the running system.\n\n```erlang\n51> halt().\nstrider 2>\n```\n\nCommand 51 exits the Erlang runtime system.","ref":"shell.html#module-example"},{"type":"module","title":"JCL Mode - shell","doc":"When the shell starts, it starts a single evaluator process.

In this mode, the shell evaluates\na function call only if allowed. This feature makes it possible to, for example,\nprevent a user from accidentally calling a function from the prompt that could\nharm a running system (useful in combination with system flag `+Bi`).\n\nWhen the restricted shell evaluates an expression and encounters a function call\nor an operator application, it calls a callback function (with information about\nthe function call in question). This callback function returns `true` to let the\nshell go ahead with the evaluation, or `false` to abort it. There are two\npossible callback functions for the user to implement:\n\n- `local_allowed(Func, ArgList, State) -> {boolean(),NewState}`\n\n  This is used to determine if the call to the local function `Func` with\n  arguments `ArgList` is to be allowed.\n\n- `non_local_allowed(FuncSpec, ArgList, State) -> {boolean(),NewState} | {{redirect,NewFuncSpec,NewArgList},NewState}`\n\n  This is used to determine if the call to non-local function `FuncSpec`\n  (`{Module,Func}` or a fun) with arguments `ArgList` is to be allowed. The\n  return value `{redirect,NewFuncSpec,NewArgList}` can be used to let the shell\n  evaluate some other function than the one specified by `FuncSpec` and\n  `ArgList`.\n\nThese callback functions are called from local and non-local evaluation function\nhandlers, described in the `m:erl_eval` manual page. (Arguments in `ArgList` are\nevaluated before the callback functions are called.)\n\nFrom OTP 25.0, if there are errors evaluating Erlang constructs, such as\n`badmatch` during pattern matching or `bad_generator` in a comprehension, the\nevaluator will dispatch to `erlang:raise(error, Reason, Stacktrace)`. This call\nwill be checked against the `non_local_allowed/3` callback function. You can\neither forbid it, allow it, or redirect to another call of your choice.\n\nArgument `State` is a tuple `{ShellState,ExprState}`. The return value\n`NewState` has the same form. This can be used to carry a state between calls to\nthe callback functions. Data saved in `ShellState` lives through an entire shell\nsession. Data saved in `ExprState` lives only through the evaluation of the\ncurrent expression.\n\nThere are two ways to start a restricted shell session:\n\n- Use STDLIB application variable `restricted_shell` and specify, as its value,\n  the name of the callback module. Example (with callback functions implemented\n  in `callback_mod.erl`): `$ erl -stdlib restricted_shell callback_mod`.\n- From a normal shell session, call function `start_restricted/1`. This exits\n  the current evaluator and starts a new one in restricted mode.\n\n_Notes:_\n\n- When restricted shell mode is activated or deactivated, new jobs started on\n  the node run in restricted or normal mode, respectively.\n- If restricted mode has been enabled on a particular node, remote shells\n  connecting to this node also run in restricted mode.\n- The callback functions cannot be used to allow or disallow execution of\n  functions called from compiled code (only functions called from expressions\n  entered at the shell prompt).\n\nErrors when loading the callback module is handled in different ways depending\non how the restricted shell is activated:\n\n- If the restricted shell is activated by setting the STDLIB variable during\n  emulator startup, and the callback module cannot be loaded, a default\n  restricted shell allowing only the commands `q()` and `init:stop()` is used as\n  fallback.\n- If the restricted shell is activated using `start_restricted/1` and the\n  callback module cannot be loaded, an error report is sent to the error logger\n  and the call returns `{error,Reason}`.","ref":"shell.html#module-restricted-shell"},{"type":"module","title":"Prompting - shell","doc":"The default shell prompt function displays the name of the node (if the node can\nbe part of a distributed system) and the current command number.

Chunks containing binary terms\nare read from a sequence of files, sorted internally in memory and written on\ntemporary files, which are merged producing one sorted file as output. Merging\nis provided as an optimization; it is faster when the files are already sorted,\nbut it always works to sort instead of merge.\n\nOn a file, a term is represented by a header and a binary. Two options define\nthe format of terms on files:\n\n- **`{header, HeaderLength}`** - `HeaderLength` determines the number of bytes\n  preceding each binary and containing the length of the binary in bytes.\n  Defaults to 4. The order of the header bytes is defined as follows: if `B` is\n  a binary containing a header only, size `Size` of the binary is calculated as\n  `< > = B`.\n\n- **`{format, Format}`** - Option `Format` determines the function that is\n  applied to binaries to create the terms to be sorted. Defaults to\n  `binary_term`, which is equivalent to `fun binary_to_term/1`. Value `binary`\n  is equivalent to `fun(X) -> X end`, which means that the binaries are sorted\n  as they are. This is the fastest format. If `Format` is `term`, `io:read/2` is\n  called to read terms. In that case, only the default value of option `header`\n  is allowed.\n\n  Option `format` also determines what is written to the sorted output file: if\n  `Format` is `term`, then `io:format/3` is called to write each term, otherwise\n  the binary prefixed by a header is written. Notice that the binary written is\n  the same binary that was read; the results of applying function `Format` are\n  thrown away when the terms have been sorted. Reading and writing terms using\n  the `io` module is much slower than reading and writing binaries.\n\nOther options are:\n\n- **`{order, Order}`** - The default is to sort terms in ascending order, but\n  that can be changed by value `descending` or by specifying an ordering\n  function `Fun`. An ordering function is antisymmetric, transitive, and total.\n  `Fun(A, B)` is to return `true` if `A` comes before `B` in the ordering,\n  otherwise `false`. An example of a typical ordering function is less than or\n  equal to, `=</2`. Using an ordering function slows down the sort considerably.\n  Functions `keysort`, `keymerge` and `keycheck` do not accept ordering\n  functions.\n\n- **`{unique, boolean()}`** - When sorting or merging files, only the first of a\n  sequence of terms that compare equal (`==`) is output if this option is set to\n  `true`. Defaults to `false`, which implies that all terms that compare equal\n  are output. When checking files for sortedness, a check that no pair of\n  consecutive terms compares equal is done if this option is set to `true`.\n\n- **`{tmpdir, TempDirectory}`** - The directory where temporary files are put\n  can be chosen explicitly. The default, implied by value `\"\"`, is to put\n  temporary files on the same directory as the sorted output file. If output is\n  a function (see below), the directory returned by `file:get_cwd()` is used\n  instead. The names of temporary files are derived from the Erlang nodename\n  (`node/0`), the process identifier of the current Erlang emulator\n  (`os:getpid()`), and a unique integer (`erlang:unique_integer([positive])`). A\n  typical name is `fs_mynode@myhost_1763_4711.17`, where `17` is a sequence\n  number. Existing files are overwritten. Temporary files are deleted unless\n  some uncaught `EXIT` signal occurs.\n\n- **`{compressed, boolean()}`** - Temporary files and the output file can be\n  compressed. Defaults `false`, which implies that written files are not\n  compressed. Regardless of the value of option `compressed`, compressed files\n  can always be read. Notice that reading and writing compressed files are\n  significantly slower than reading and writing uncompressed files.\n\n- **`{size, Size}`** - By default about 512\\*1024 bytes read from files are\n  sorted internally. This option is rarely needed.\n\n- **`{no_files, NoFiles}`** - By default 16 files are merged at a time. This\n  option is rarely needed.\n\nAs an alternative to sorting files, a function of one argument can be specified\nas input. When called with argument `read`, the function is assumed to return\neither of the following:\n\n- `end_of_input` or `{end_of_input, Value}}` when there is no more input\n  (`Value` is explained below).\n- `{Objects, Fun}`, where `Objects` is a list of binaries or terms depending on\n  the format, and `Fun` is a new input function.\n\nAny other value is immediately returned as value of the current call to `sort`\nor `keysort`. Each input function is called exactly once. If an error occurs,\nthe last function is called with argument `close`, the reply of which is\nignored.\n\nA function of one argument can be specified as output. The results of sorting or\nmerging the input is collected in a non-empty sequence of variable length lists\nof binaries or terms depending on the format. The output function is called with\none list at a time, and is assumed to return a new output function. Any other\nreturn value is immediately returned as value of the current call to the sort or\nmerge function. Each output function is called exactly once. When some output\nfunction has been applied to all of the results or an error occurs, the last\nfunction is called with argument `close`, and the reply is returned as value of\nthe current call to the sort or merge function.\n\nIf a function is specified as input and the last input function returns\n`{end_of_input, Value}`, the function specified as output is called with\nargument `{value, Value}`. This makes it easy to initiate the sequence of output\nfunctions with a value calculated by the input functions.\n\nAs an example, consider sorting the terms on a disk log file. A function that\nreads chunks from the disk log and returns a list of binaries is used as input.\nThe results are collected in a list of terms.\n\n```erlang\nsort(Log) ->\n    {ok, _} = disk_log:open([{name,Log}, {mode,read_only}]),\n    Input = input(Log, start),\n    Output = output([]),\n    Reply = file_sorter:sort(Input, Output, {format,term}),\n    ok = disk_log:close(Log),\n    Reply.\n\ninput(Log, Cont) ->\n    fun(close) ->\n            ok;\n       (read) ->\n            case disk_log:chunk(Log, Cont) of\n                {error, Reason} ->\n                    {error, Reason};\n                {Cont2, Terms} ->\n                    {Terms, input(Log, Cont2)};\n                {Cont2, Terms, _Badbytes} ->\n                    {Terms, input(Log, Cont2)};\n                eof ->\n                    end_of_input\n            end\n    end.\n\noutput(L) ->\n    fun(close) ->\n            lists:append(lists:reverse(L));\n       (Terms) ->\n            output([Terms | L])\n    end.\n```\n\nFor more examples of functions as input and output, see the end of the\n`file_sorter` module; the `term` format is implemented with functions.\n\nThe possible values of `Reason` returned when an error occurs are:\n\n- `bad_object`, `{bad_object, FileName}` \\- Applying the format function failed\n  for some binary, or the key(s) could not be extracted from some term.\n- `{bad_term, FileName}` \\- `io:read/2` failed to read some term.\n- `{file_error, FileName, file:posix()}` \\- For an explanation of\n  [`file:posix()`](`t:file:posix/0`), see `m:file`.\n- `{premature_eof, FileName}` \\- End-of-file was encountered inside some binary\n  term.","ref":"file_sorter.html"},{"type":"function","title":"file_sorter.check/1","doc":"Equivalent to  check([FileName], []) .","ref":"file_sorter.html#check/1"},{"type":"function","title":"file_sorter.check/2","doc":"Checks files for sortedness.

To normalize a filename by removing redundant\ndirectory separators, use `join/1`.\n\nThe module supports [raw filenames](unicode_usage.md#notes-about-raw-filenames)\nin the way that if a binary is present, or the filename cannot be interpreted\naccording to the return value of `file:native_name_encoding/0`, a raw filename\nis also returned. For example, [`join/1`](`join/1`) provided with a path\ncomponent that is a binary (and cannot be interpreted under the current native\nfilename encoding) results in a raw filename that is returned (the join\noperation is performed of course). For more information about raw filenames, see\nthe `m:file` module.\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> Functionality in this module generally assumes valid input and does not\n> necessarily fail on input that does not use a valid encoding, but may instead\n> very likely produce invalid output.\n>\n> File operations used to accept filenames containing null characters (integer\n> value zero). This caused the name to be truncated and in some cases arguments\n> to primitive operations to be mixed up. Filenames containing null characters\n> inside the filename are now _rejected_ and will cause primitive file\n> operations to fail.\n\n> #### Warning {: .warning }\n>\n> Currently null characters at the end of the filename will be accepted by\n> primitive file operations. Such filenames are however still documented as\n> invalid. The implementation will also change in the future and reject such\n> filenames.","ref":"filename.html"},{"type":"function","title":"filename.absname/1","doc":"Converts a relative `Filename` and returns an absolute name.

This is one or more characters that\n  change the interpretation of `Data`.\n\n  The current modifiers are:\n\n  - **`t`** - For Unicode translation.\n\n  - **`l`** - For stopping `p` and `P` from detecting printable characters.\n\n  - **`k`** - For use with `p`, `P`, `w`, and `W` to format maps in map-key\n    `ordered` order (see `t:maps:iterator_order/0`).\n\n  - **`K`** - Similar to `k`, for formatting maps in map-key order, but takes an\n    extra argument that specifies the `t:maps:iterator_order/0`.\n\n    For example:\n\n    ```erlang\n    > M = #{ a => 1, b => 2 }.\n    #{a => 1,b => 2}\n    > io:format(\"~Kp~n\", [reversed, M]).\n    #{b => 2,a => 1}\n    ok\n    ```\n\nIf `F`, `P`, or `Pad` is a `*` character, the next argument in `Data` is used as\nthe value. For example:\n\n```erlang\n1> io:fwrite(\"~*.*.0f~n\",[9, 5, 3.14159265]).\n003.14159\nok\n```\n\nTo use a literal `*` character as `Pad`, it must be passed as an argument:\n\n```erlang\n2> io:fwrite(\"~*.*.*f~n\",[9, 5, $*, 3.14159265]).\n**3.14159\nok\n```\n\n_Available control sequences:_\n\n- **`~`** - Character `~` is written.\n\n- **`c`** - The argument is a number that is interpreted as an ASCII code. The\n  precision is the number of times the character is printed and defaults to the\n  field width, which in turn defaults to 1. Example:\n\n  ```erlang\n  1> io:fwrite(\"|~10.5c|~-10.5c|~5c|~n\", [$a, $b, $c]).\n  |     aaaaa|bbbbb     |ccccc|\n  ok\n  ```\n\n  If the Unicode translation modifier (`t`) is in effect, the integer argument\n  can be any number representing a valid Unicode codepoint, otherwise it is to\n  be an integer less than or equal to 255, otherwise it is masked with 16#FF:\n\n  ```erlang\n  2> io:fwrite(\"~tc~n\",[1024]).\n  \\x{400}\n  ok\n  3> io:fwrite(\"~c~n\",[1024]).\n  ^@\n  ok\n  ```\n\n- **`f`** - The argument is a float that is written as `[-]ddd.ddd`, where the\n  precision is the number of digits after the decimal point. The default\n  precision is 6 and it cannot be < 1.\n\n- **`e`** - The argument is a float that is written as `[-]d.ddde+-ddd`, where\n  the precision is the number of digits written. The default precision is 6 and\n  it cannot be < 2.\n\n- **`g`** - The argument is a float that is written as `f`, if it is >= 0.1 and\n  < 10000.0. Otherwise, it is written in the `e` format. The precision is the\n  number of significant digits. It defaults to 6 and is not to be < 2. If the\n  absolute value of the float does not allow it to be written in the `f` format\n  with the desired number of significant digits, it is also written in the `e`\n  format.\n\n- **`s`** - Prints the argument with the string syntax. The argument is, if no\n  Unicode translation modifier is present, an `t:iolist/0`, a `t:binary/0`, or\n  an `t:atom/0`. If the Unicode translation modifier (`t`) is in effect, the\n  argument is [`unicode:chardata()`](`t:unicode:chardata/0`), meaning that\n  binaries are in UTF-8. The characters are printed without quotes. The string\n  is first truncated by the specified precision and then padded and justified to\n  the specified field width. The default precision is the field width.\n\n  This format can be used for printing any object and truncating the output so\n  it fits a specified field:\n\n  ```erlang\n  1> io:fwrite(\"|~10w|~n\", [{hey, hey, hey}]).\n  |**********|\n  ok\n  2> io:fwrite(\"|~10s|~n\", [io_lib:write({hey, hey, hey})]).\n  |{hey,hey,h|\n  3> io:fwrite(\"|~-10.8s|~n\", [io_lib:write({hey, hey, hey})]).\n  |{hey,hey  |\n  ok\n  ```\n\n  A list with integers > 255 is considered an error if the Unicode translation\n  modifier is not specified:\n\n  ```erlang\n  4> io:fwrite(\"~ts~n\",[[1024]]).\n  \\x{400}\n  ok\n  5> io:fwrite(\"~s~n\",[[1024]]).\n  ** exception error: bad argument\n       in function  io:format/3\n          called as io:format(<0.53.0>,\"~s~n\",[[1024]])\n  ```\n\n- **`w`** - Writes data with the standard syntax. This is used to output Erlang\n  terms. Atoms are printed within quotes if they contain embedded non-printable\n  characters. Atom characters > 255 are escaped unless the Unicode translation\n  modifier (`t`) is used. Floats are printed accurately as the shortest,\n  correctly rounded string.\n\n- **`p`**{: #tilde_p } - Writes the data with standard syntax in the same way as `~w`, but\n  breaks terms whose printed representation is longer than one line into many\n  lines and indents each line sensibly. Left-justification is not supported. It\n  also tries to detect flat lists of printable characters and output these as\n  strings. For example:\n\n  ```erlang\n  1> T = [{attributes,[[{id,age,1.50000},{mode,explicit},\n  {typename,\"INTEGER\"}], [{id,cho},{mode,explicit},{typename,'Cho'}]]},\n  {typename,'Person'},{tag,{'PRIVATE',3}},{mode,implicit}].\n  ...\n  2> io:fwrite(\"~w~n\", [T]).\n  [{attributes,[[{id,age,1.5},{mode,explicit},{typename,\n  [73,78,84,69,71,69,82]}],[{id,cho},{mode,explicit},{typena\n  me,'Cho'}]]},{typename,'Person'},{tag,{'PRIVATE',3}},{mode\n  ,implicit}]\n  ok\n  3> io:fwrite(\"~62p~n\", [T]).\n  [{attributes,[[{id,age,1.5},\n                 {mode,explicit},\n                 {typename,\"INTEGER\"}],\n                [{id,cho},{mode,explicit},{typename,'Cho'}]]},\n   {typename,'Person'},\n   {tag,{'PRIVATE',3}},\n   {mode,implicit}]\n  ok\n  ```\n\n  The field width specifies the maximum line length. It defaults to 80. The\n  precision specifies the initial indentation of the term. It defaults to the\n  number of characters printed on this line in the _same_ call to `write/1` or\n  [`format/1,2,3`](`format/1`). For example, using `T` above:\n\n  ```erlang\n  4> io:fwrite(\"Here T = ~62p~n\", [T]).\n  Here T = [{attributes,[[{id,age,1.5},\n                          {mode,explicit},\n                          {typename,\"INTEGER\"}],\n                         [{id,cho},\n                          {mode,explicit},\n                          {typename,'Cho'}]]},\n            {typename,'Person'},\n            {tag,{'PRIVATE',3}},\n            {mode,implicit}]\n  ok\n  ```\n\n  As from Erlang/OTP 21.0, a field width of value `0` can be used for specifying\n  that a line is infinitely long, which means that no line breaks are inserted.\n  For example:\n\n  ```erlang\n  5> io:fwrite(\"~0p~n\", [lists:seq(1, 30)]).\n  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30]\n  ok\n  ```\n\n  When the modifier `l` is specified, no detection of printable character lists\n  takes place, for example:\n\n  ```erlang\n  6> S = [{a,\"a\"}, {b, \"b\"}],\n     io:fwrite(\"~15p~n\", [S]).\n  [{a,\"a\"},\n   {b,\"b\"}]\n  ok\n  7> io:fwrite(\"~15lp~n\", [S]).\n  [{a,[97]},\n   {b,[98]}]\n  ok\n  ```\n\n  The Unicode translation modifier `t` specifies how to treat characters outside\n  the Latin-1 range of codepoints, in atoms, strings, and binaries. For example,\n  printing an atom containing a character > 255:\n\n  ```erlang\n  8> io:fwrite(\"~p~n\",[list_to_atom([1024])]).\n  '\\x{400}'\n  ok\n  9> io:fwrite(\"~tp~n\",[list_to_atom([1024])]).\n  'Ѐ'\n  ok\n  ```\n\n  By default, Erlang only detects lists of characters in the Latin-1 range as\n  strings, but the `+pc unicode` flag can be used to change this (see\n  `printable_range/0` for details). For example:\n\n  ```erlang\n  10> io:fwrite(\"~p~n\",[[214]]).\n  \"Ö\"\n  ok\n  11> io:fwrite(\"~p~n\",[[1024]]).\n  [1024]\n  ok\n  12> io:fwrite(\"~tp~n\",[[1024]]).\n  [1024]\n  ok\n  ```\n\n  but if Erlang was started with `+pc unicode`:\n\n  ```erlang\n  13> io:fwrite(\"~p~n\",[[1024]]).\n  [1024]\n  ok\n  14> io:fwrite(\"~tp~n\",[[1024]]).\n  \"Ѐ\"\n  ok\n  ```\n\n  Similarly, binaries that look like UTF-8 encoded strings are output with the\n  binary string syntax if the `t` modifier is specified:\n\n  ```erlang\n  15> io:fwrite(\"~p~n\", [<<208,128>>]).\n  <<208,128>>\n  ok\n  16> io:fwrite(\"~tp~n\", [<<208,128>>]).\n  <<\"Ѐ\"/utf8>>\n  ok\n  17> io:fwrite(\"~tp~n\", [<<128,128>>]).\n  <<128,128>>\n  ok\n  ```\n\n- **`W`** - Writes data in the same way as `~w`, but takes an extra argument\n  that is the maximum depth to which terms are printed. Anything below this\n  depth is replaced with `...`. For example, using `T` above:\n\n  ```erlang\n  8> io:fwrite(\"~W~n\", [T,9]).\n  [{attributes,[[{id,age,1.5},{mode,explicit},{typename,...}],\n  [{id,cho},{mode,...},{...}]]},{typename,'Person'},\n  {tag,{'PRIVATE',3}},{mode,implicit}]\n  ok\n  ```\n\n  If the maximum depth is reached, it cannot be read in the resultant output.\n  Also, the `,...` form in a tuple denotes that there are more elements in the\n  tuple but these are below the print depth.\n\n- **`P`** - Writes data in the same way as `~p`, but takes an extra argument\n  that is the maximum depth to which terms are printed. Anything below this\n  depth is replaced with `...`, for example:\n\n  ```erlang\n  9> io:fwrite(\"~62P~n\", [T,9]).\n  [{attributes,[[{id,age,1.5},{mode,explicit},{typename,...}],\n                [{id,cho},{mode,...},{...}]]},\n   {typename,'Person'},\n   {tag,{'PRIVATE',3}},\n   {mode,implicit}]\n  ok\n  ```\n\n- **`B`** - Writes an integer in base 2-36, the default base is 10. A leading\n  dash is printed for negative integers.\n\n  The precision field selects base, for example:\n\n  ```erlang\n  1> io:fwrite(\"~.16B~n\", [31]).\n  1F\n  ok\n  2> io:fwrite(\"~.2B~n\", [-19]).\n  -10011\n  ok\n  3> io:fwrite(\"~.36B~n\", [5*36+35]).\n  5Z\n  ok\n  ```\n\n- **`X`** - Like `B`, but takes an extra argument that is a prefix to insert\n  before the number, but after the leading dash, if any.\n\n  The prefix can be a possibly deep list of characters or an atom. Example:\n\n  ```erlang\n  1> io:fwrite(\"~X~n\", [31,\"10#\"]).\n  10#31\n  ok\n  2> io:fwrite(\"~.16X~n\", [-31,\"0x\"]).\n  -0x1F\n  ok\n  ```\n\n- **`#`** - Like `B`, but prints the number with an Erlang style `#`\\-separated\n  base prefix. Example:\n\n  ```erlang\n  1> io:fwrite(\"~.10#~n\", [31]).\n  10#31\n  ok\n  2> io:fwrite(\"~.16#~n\", [-31]).\n  -16#1F\n  ok\n  ```\n\n- **`b`** - Like `B`, but prints lowercase letters.\n\n- **`x`** - Like `X`, but prints lowercase letters.\n\n- **`+`** - Like `#`, but prints lowercase letters.\n\n- **`n`** - Writes a new line.\n\n- **`i`** - Ignores the next term.\n\nThe function returns:\n\n- **`ok`** - The formatting succeeded.\n\nIf an error occurs, there is no output. Example:\n\n```erlang\n1> io:fwrite(\"~s ~w ~i ~w ~c ~n\",['abc def', 'abc def', {foo, 1},{foo, 1}, 65]).\nabc def 'abc def'  {foo,1} A\nok\n2> io:fwrite(\"~s\", [65]).\n** exception error: bad argument\n     in function  io:format/3\n        called as io:format(<0.53.0>,\"~s\",\"A\")\n```\n\nIn this example, an attempt was made to output the single character 65 with the\naid of the string formatting directive `\"~s\"`.","ref":"io.html#fwrite/3"},{"type":"function","title":"io.get_chars/2","doc":"Equivalent to  get_chars(standard_io, Prompt, Count) .","ref":"io.html#get_chars/2"},{"type":"function","title":"io.get_chars/3","doc":"Reads `Count` characters from [`IoDevice`](`t:device/0`), prompting it with `Prompt`.\n\nThe function returns:\n\n- **`Data`** - The input characters.

Possible options and values vary\ndepending on the I/O device.\n\nFor a list of supported options and their current values on a specific I/O\ndevice, use function `getopts/1`.\n\nThe options and values supported by the OTP I/O devices are as follows:\n\n- **`binary`, `list`, or `{binary, boolean()}`** - If set in binary mode\n  (`binary` or `{binary, true}`), the I/O server sends binary data (encoded in\n  UTF-8) as answers to the `get_line`, `get_chars`, and, if possible,\n  `get_until` requests (for details, see section\n  [The Erlang I/O Protocol](io_protocol.md)) in the User's Guide). The immediate\n  effect is that [`get_chars/2,3`](`get_chars/2`) and\n  [`get_line/1,2`](`get_line/1`) return UTF-8 binaries instead of lists of\n  characters for the affected I/O device.\n\n  By default, all I/O devices in OTP are set in `list` mode. However, the I/O\n  functions can handle any of these modes and so should other, user-written,\n  modules behaving as clients to I/O servers.\n\n  This option is supported by the `t:standard_io/0`, `t:user/0` and `t:file:io_server/0`\n   I/O servers.\n\n- **`{echo, boolean()}`** - Denotes if the terminal is to echo input. Only\n  supported for the standard shell I/O server (`group.erl`)\n\n- **`{expand_fun, expand_fun()}`** - Provides a function for tab-completion\n  (expansion) like the Erlang shell. This function is called when the user\n  presses the _Tab_ key. The expansion is active when calling line-reading\n  functions, such as [`get_line/1,2`](`get_line/1`).\n\n  The function is called with the current line, up to the cursor, as a reversed\n  string. It is to return a three-tuple: `{yes|no, string(), list()}`. The first\n  element gives a beep if `no`, otherwise the expansion is silent; the second is\n  a string that will be entered at the cursor position; the third is a list of\n  possible expansions. If this list is not empty, it is printed below the\n  current input line. The list of possible expansions can be formatted in\n  different ways to make more advanced expansion suggestions more readable to\n  the user, see `edlin_expand:expand/2` for documentation of that.\n\n  Trivial example (beep on anything except empty line, which is expanded to\n  `\"quit\"`):\n\n  ```erlang\n  fun(\"\") -> {yes, \"quit\", []};\n     (_) -> {no, \"\", [\"quit\"]} end\n  ```\n\n  This option is only supported by the standard shell (`group.erl`).\n\n- **`{line_history, true | false}`** - Specifies if `get_line` and `get_until`\n  I/O requests should be saved in the `m:shell` history buffer.\n\n  This option is only supported by the standard shell (`group.erl`).\n\n- **`{log, none | output | input | all}`** - Tells the I/O server that it should log\n  I/O requests. Requests will be logged at [`info` level](`t:logger:level/0`) to the\n  `[otp, kernel, io, input | output | ctrl]` domain with the following report:\n\n  ```erl\n  #{ request := IoRequest, server := pid(), server_name => term() }.\n  ```\n\n  It is important to note that extra care should be taken so that these log reports are not\n  logged to `t:standard_io/0` as that may cause the system to enter an infinite loop.\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```\n  1> logger:set_primary_config(level, info).\n  ok\n  2> logger:add_handler(stdout, logger_std_h, #{ config => #{ file => \"stdout.log\" }}).\n  ok\n  3> io:setopts(user, [{log, output}]).\n  ok\n  4> io:format(user, \"Hello~n\", []).\n  Hello\n  ok\n  5> file:read_file(\"stdout.log\").\n  {ok,<<\"2024-11-14T09:53:49.275085+01:00 info: <0.89.0> wrote to user, Hello\\n\">>}\n  ```\n\n  Not all I/O servers support this option. Use `io:getopts/1` to check if it is available.\n\n  > #### Note {: .info }\n  >\n  > The I/O servers in Erlang/OTP will set the [logger domain](`logger_filters:domain/2`)\n  > to `[otp, kernel, io, input | output]`.

The encoding is set with the help of the `LANG` or `LC_CTYPE`\n  environment variables on Unix-like system or by other means on other systems.\n  So, the user can input Unicode characters and the I/O device is in\n  `{encoding, unicode}` mode if the I/O device supports it. The mode can be\n  changed, if the assumption of the runtime system is wrong, by setting this\n  option.\n\n  > #### Note {: .info }\n  >\n  > Prior to OTP 26.0, when Erlang was started with the `-oldshell` or\n  > `-noshell` flags (for example, in an `escript`), the default encoding for\n  > [`standard_io`](`t:standard_io/0`) was set to `latin1`, meaning that any\n  > characters > codepoint 255 were escaped and that input was expected to be\n  > plain 8-bit ISO Latin-1.

More encodings are possible for files, see below.\n\n  `{encoding, unicode | latin1}` is supported by both the standard shell\n  (`group.erl` including `werl` on Windows), the 'oldshell' (`user.erl`), and\n  the file I/O servers.\n\n- **`{encoding, utf8 | utf16 | utf32 | {utf16,big} | {utf16,little} | {utf32,big} | {utf32,little}}`** -\n  For disk files, the encoding can be set to various UTF variants. This has the\n  effect that data is expected to be read as the specified encoding from the\n  file, and the data is written in the specified encoding to the disk file.\n\n  `{encoding, utf8}` has the same effect as `{encoding, unicode}` on files.\n\n  The extended encodings are only supported on disk files (opened by function\n  `file:open/2`).","ref":"io.html#setopts/2"},{"type":"type","title":"io.standard_error/0","doc":"The I/O device `standard_error` can be used to direct output to whatever the\ncurrent operating system considers a suitable I/O device for error output.

This description of\nPCRE2's regular expressions is intended as reference material.\n\nThe reference material is divided into the following sections:\n\n- [Special Start-of-Pattern Items](`m:re#sect1`)\n- [Characters and Metacharacters](`m:re#sect2`)\n- [Backslash](`m:re#sect3`)\n- [Circumflex and Dollar](`m:re#sect4`)\n- [Full Stop (Period, Dot) and \\\\N](`m:re#sect5`)\n- [Matching a Single Code Unit](`m:re#sect6`)\n- [Square Brackets and Character Classes](`m:re#sect7`)\n- [Perl Extended Character Classes](`m:re#sect7X`)\n- [Posix Character Classes](`m:re#sect8`)\n- [Vertical Bar](`m:re#sect9`)\n- [Internal Option Setting](`m:re#sect10`)\n- [Groups](`m:re#sect11`)\n- [Duplicate Group Numbers](`m:re#sect12`)\n- [Named Capture Groups](`m:re#sect13`)\n- [Repetition](`m:re#sect14`)\n- [Atomic Grouping and Possessive Quantifiers](`m:re#sect15`)\n- [Backreferences](`m:re#sect16`)\n- [Assertions](`m:re#sect17`)\n- [Non-Atomic Assertions ](`m:re#sect18`)\n- [Scan Substring Assertions](`m:re#sect18X`)\n- [Script Runs](`m:re#sect19`)\n- [Conditional Groups](`m:re#sect20`)\n- [Comments](`m:re#sect21`)\n- [Recursive Patterns](`m:re#sect22`)\n- [Groups as Subroutines](`m:re#sect23`)\n- [Recursion and subroutines with returned capture groups](`m:re#sect24`)\n- [Oniguruma Subroutine Syntax](`m:re#sect25`)\n- [Backtracking Control](`m:re#sect26`)\n\n\n[](){: #sect1 }","ref":"re.html#module-pcre2-regular-expression-details"},{"type":"module","title":"Special Start-of-Pattern Items - re","doc":"A number of options that can be passed to `compile/2` can also be set\nby special items at the start of a pattern. These are not Perl-compatible, but\nare provided to make these options accessible to pattern writers who are not\nable to change the program that processes the pattern. Any number of these\nitems may appear, but they must all be together right at the start of the\npattern string, and the letters must be in upper case.\n\n_UTF support_\n\n\nUnicode support is basically UTF-8 based. To use Unicode characters, you either\ncall `compile/2` or `run/3` with option `unicode`, or the pattern must start\nwith one of these special sequences: `(*UTF)`, which is equivalent to setting `unicode`.\nNote that with these instructions, the automatic conversion of lists to UTF-8\nis not performed by the `re` functions. Therefore, using these sequences is not\nrecommended. Add option `unicode` when running `compile/2` instead.\n\nSome applications that allow their users to supply patterns may wish to\nrestrict them to non-UTF data for security reasons. If the `never_utf`\noption is passed to `compile/2`, `(*UTF)` is not allowed, and its\nappearance in a pattern causes an error.\n\n_Unicode Property Support_\n\n\nAnother special sequence that may appear at the start of a pattern is `(*UCP)`.\nThis has the same effect as setting the `ucp` option: it causes sequences\nsuch as `\\d` and `\\w` to use Unicode properties to determine character types,\ninstead of recognizing only characters with codes less than 256 via a lookup\ntable. It also causes upper/lower casing operations to use Unicode properties\nfor characters with code points greater than 127, even when UTF is not set.\nThese behaviours can be changed within the pattern; see [Internal Option Setting](`m:re#sect10`).\n\nSome applications that allow their users to supply patterns may wish to\nrestrict them for security reasons. If the `never_ucp` option is passed to\n`compile/2`, `(*UCP)` is not allowed, and its appearance in a pattern\ncauses an error.\n\n_Locking Out Empty String Matching_\n\nStarting a pattern with `(*NOTEMPTY)` or `(*NOTEMPTY_ATSTART)` has the same effect\nas passing the `notempty` or `notempty_atstart` option to whichever\nmatching function is subsequently called to match the pattern. These options\nlock out the matching of empty strings, either entirely, or only at the start\nof the subject.\n\n_Disabling Start-Up Optimizations_\n\n\nIf a pattern starts with `(*NO_START_OPT)`, it has the same effect as setting the\n`no_start_optimize` option. This disables several optimizations for\nquickly reaching \"no match\" results.\n\n_Disabling Automatic Anchoring_\n\n\nIf a pattern starts with `(*NO_DOTSTAR_ANCHOR)`. This disables optimizations that\napply to patterns whose top-level branches all start with .* (match any number\nof arbitrary characters).\n\n_Setting Match Resource Limits_\n\n\nThe caller of `run/3` can set a\nlimit on this counter, which therefore limits the amount of computing resource\nused for a match. The maximum depth of nested backtracking can also be limited;\nthis indirectly restricts the amount of heap memory that is used, but there is\nalso an explicit memory limit that can be set.\n\nThese facilities are provided to catch runaway matches that are provoked by\npatterns with huge matching trees. A common example is a pattern with nested\nunlimited repeats applied to a long string that does not match. When one of\nthese limits is reached, `run/3` gives an error return. The limits\ncan also be set by items at the start of the pattern of the form\n\n```text\n(*LIMIT_HEAP=d)\n(*LIMIT_MATCH=d)\n(*LIMIT_DEPTH=d)\n```\n\nwhere d is any number of decimal digits. However, the value of the setting must\nbe less than the value set as default\nfor it to have any effect. In other words, the pattern writer can lower the\nlimits set by the programmer, but not raise them. If there is more than one\nsetting of one of these limits, the lower value is used. The heap limit is\nspecified in kibibytes (units of 1024 bytes).\n\nThe default value for `LIMIT_MATCH` and `LIMIT_DEPTH` is 10,000,000 in the\nErlang VM.\nNotice that the recursion limit does not affect the stack depth of the VM, as PCRE for\nErlang is compiled in such a way that the match function never does recursion on\nthe C stack.\n\nPrior to release 10.30, LIMIT_DEPTH was called LIMIT_RECURSION. This name is\nstill recognized for backwards compatibility.\n\n[](){: #sect1.1}\n_Newline Conventions_\n\n\nPCRE2 supports six different conventions for indicating line breaks in\nstrings: a single CR (carriage return) character, a single LF (linefeed)\ncharacter, the two-character sequence CRLF, any of the three preceding, any\nUnicode newline sequence, or the NUL character (binary zero).\n\nIt is also possible to specify a newline convention by starting a pattern\nstring with one of the following sequences:\n\n- **(*CR)** -  carriage return\n- **(*LF)** -  linefeed\n- **(*CRLF)** -  carriage return, followed by linefeed\n- **(*ANYCRLF)** -  any of the three above\n- **(*ANY)** -  all Unicode newline sequences\n- **(*NUL)** -  the NUL character (binary zero)\n\nThese override the default and the options given to the compiling function. For\nexample, on a Unix system where LF is the default newline sequence, the pattern\n\n```text\n(*CR)a.b\n```\n\nchanges the convention to CR. That pattern matches \"a\\nb\" because LF is no\nlonger a newline. If more than one of these settings is present, the last one\nis used.\n\nThe newline convention affects where the circumflex and dollar assertions are\ntrue. It also affects the interpretation of the dot metacharacter when\n`dotall` is not set, and the behaviour of `\\N` when not followed by an\nopening brace. However, it does not affect what the `\\R` escape sequence\nmatches. By default, this is any Unicode newline sequence, for Perl\ncompatibility. However, this can be changed; see the next section and the\ndescription of `\\R` in [Newline Sequences](`m:re#sect3.3`).\nA change of `\\R` setting can be combined with a change of newline\nconvention.\n\n_Specifying What `\\R` Matches_\n\n\nIt is possible to restrict `\\R` to match only CR, LF, or CRLF (instead of the\ncomplete set of Unicode line endings) by setting the option `bsr_anycrlf`\nat compile time. This effect can also be achieved by starting a pattern with\n`(*BSR_ANYCRLF)`. For completeness, `(*BSR_UNICODE)` is also recognized,\ncorresponding to `bsr_anycrlf`.\n\n\n[](){: #sect2 }","ref":"re.html#module-special-start-of-pattern-items"},{"type":"module","title":"Characters and Metacharacters - re","doc":"A regular expression is a pattern that is matched against a subject string from\nleft to right. Most characters stand for themselves in a pattern, and match the\ncorresponding characters in the subject. As a trivial example, the pattern\n\n```text\nThe quick brown fox\n```\n\nmatches a portion of a subject string that is identical to itself. When\ncaseless matching is specified (the `caseless` option or (?i) within the\npattern), letters are matched independently of case. Note that there are two\nASCII characters, K and S, that, in addition to their lower case ASCII\nequivalents, are case-equivalent with Unicode U+212A (Kelvin sign) and U+017F\n(long S) respectively when either `unicode` or `ucp` is set.\n\nThe power of regular expressions comes from the ability to include wild cards,\ncharacter classes, alternatives, and repetitions in the pattern. These are\nencoded in the pattern by the use of _metacharacters_, which do not stand\nfor themselves but instead are interpreted in some special way.\n\nThere are two different sets of metacharacters: those that are recognized\nanywhere in the pattern except within square brackets, and those that are\nrecognized within square brackets. Outside square brackets, the metacharacters\nare as follows:\n\n- **`\\`** -  general escape character with several uses\n- **`^`** -  assert start of string (or line, in multiline mode)\n- **`$`** -  assert end of string (or line, in multiline mode)\n- **`.`** -  match any character except newline (by default)\n- **`[`** -  start character class definition\n- **`|`** -  start of alternative branch\n- **`(`** -  start group or control verb\n- **`)`** -  end group or control verb\n- **`*`** -  0 or more quantifier\n- **`+`** -  1 or more quantifier; also \"possessive quantifier\"\n- **`?`** -  0 or 1 quantifier; also quantifier minimizer\n- **`{`** -  potential start of min/max quantifier\n\nBrace characters `{` and `}` are also used to enclose data for constructions such\nas `\\g{2}` or `\\k{name}`. In almost all uses of braces, space and/or horizontal\ntab characters that follow `{` or precede `}` are allowed and are ignored. In the\ncase of quantifiers, they may also appear before or after the comma. \n\nPart of a pattern that is in square brackets is called a \"character class\". In\na character class the only metacharacters are:\n\n- **`\\`** -  general escape character\n- **`^`** -  negate the class, but only if the first character\n- **`-`** -  indicates character range\n- **`[`** -  POSIX character class (if followed by POSIX syntax)\n- **`]`** -  terminates the character class\n\nIf a pattern is compiled with the `extended` option, most white space in\nthe pattern, other than in a character class, within a `\\Q...\\E` sequence, or\nbetween a `#`  outside a character class and the next newline, inclusive, is\nignored. An escaping backslash can be used to include a white space or a #\ncharacter as part of the pattern.\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> Only these two characters are ignored,\n> not the full set of pattern white space characters that are ignored outside a\n> character class. Option settings can be changed within a pattern; see [Internal Option Setting](`m:re#sect10`).\n\nThe following sections describe the use of each of the metacharacters.\n\n[](){: #sect3}","ref":"re.html#module-characters-and-metacharacters"},{"type":"module","title":"Backslash - re","doc":"The backslash character has several uses. Firstly, if it is followed by a\ncharacter that is not a digit or a letter, it takes away any special meaning\nthat character may have. This use of backslash as an escape character applies\nboth inside and outside character classes.\n\nFor example, if you want to match a `*`  character, you must write `\\*` in the\npattern. This escaping action applies whether or not the following character\nwould otherwise be interpreted as a metacharacter, so it is always safe to\nprecede a non-alphanumeric with backslash to specify that it stands for itself.\nIn particular, if you want to match a backslash, you write `\\\\`.\n\nOnly ASCII digits and letters have any special meaning after a backslash. All\nother characters (in particular, those whose code points are greater than 127)\nare treated as literals.\n\nIf you want to treat all characters in a sequence as literals, you can do so by\nputting them between `\\Q` and `\\E`. Note that this includes white space even when\nthe `extended` option is set so that most other white space is ignored. The\nbehaviour is different from Perl in that `$` and `@` are handled as literals in\n`\\Q...\\E` sequences in PCRE2, whereas in Perl, `$` and `@` cause variable\ninterpolation. Also, Perl does \"double-quotish backslash interpolation\" on any\nbackslashes between `\\Q` and `\\E` which, its documentation says, \"may lead to\nconfusing results\". PCRE2 treats a backslash between `\\Q` and `\\E` just like any\nother character. Note the following examples:\n\n- **Pattern** -  PCRE2 matches   Perl matches\n- **\\Qabc$xyz\\E** -  abc$xyz        abc followed by the\ncontents of $xyz\n- **\\Qabc\\$xyz\\E** -  abc\\$xyz       abc\\$xyz\n- **\\Qabc\\E\\$\\Qxyz\\E** -  abc$xyz        abc$xyz\n- **\\QA\\B\\E** -  A\\B            A\\B\n- **\\Q\\\\E** -  \\              \\\\E\n\nThe `\\Q...\\E` sequence is recognized both inside and outside character classes.\nAn isolated `\\E` that is not preceded by `\\Q` is ignored. If `\\Q` is not followed\nby `\\E` later in the pattern, the literal interpretation continues to the end of\nthe pattern (that is, `\\E` is assumed at the end). If the isolated `\\Q` is inside\na character class, this causes an error, because the character class is then\nnot terminated by a closing square bracket.\n\nAnother difference from Perl is that any appearance of `\\Q` or `\\E` inside what\nmight otherwise be a quantifier causes PCRE2 not to recognize the sequence as a\nquantifier. Perl recognizes a quantifier if (redundantly) either of the numbers\nis inside `\\Q...\\E`, but not if the separating comma is. When not recognized as\na quantifier a sequence such as `{\\Q1\\E,2}` is treated as the literal string\n\"{1,2}\".\n\n[](){: #sect3.1} \n_Non-Printing Characters_\n\n\nA second use of backslash provides a way of encoding non-printing characters\nin patterns in a visible manner. There is no restriction on the appearance of\nnon-printing characters in a pattern, but when a pattern is being prepared by\ntext editing, it is often easier to use one of the following escape sequences\ninstead of the binary character it represents. In an ASCII or Unicode\nenvironment, these escapes are as follows:\n\n- **`\\a`** -  alarm, that is, the BEL character (hex 07)\n- **`\\cx`** -  \"control-x\", where x is a non-control ASCII character\n- **`\\e`** -  escape (hex 1B)\n- **`\\f`** -  form feed (hex 0C)\n- **`\\n`** -  linefeed (hex 0A)\n- **`\\r`** -  carriage return (hex 0D) (but see below)\n- **`\\t`** -  tab (hex 09)\n- **`\\0dd`** -  character with octal code 0dd\n- **`\\ddd`** -  character with octal code ddd, or back reference\n- **`\\o{ddd..}`** -  character with octal code ddd..\n- **`\\xhh`** -  character with hex code hh\n- **`\\x{hhh..}`** -  character with hex code hhh..\n- **`\\N{U+hhh..}`** -  character with Unicode hex code point hhh..\n\nA description of how back references work is given\nlater,\nfollowing the discussion of\nparenthesized groups.\n\nBy default, after `\\x` that is not followed by `{`, one or two hexadecimal\ndigits are read (letters can be in upper or lower case). If the character that\nfollows `\\x` is neither `{` nor a hexadecimal digit, an error occurs. This is\ndifferent from Perl's default behaviour, which generates a NUL character, but\nis in line with the behaviour of Perl's 'strict' mode in re.\n\nAny number of hexadecimal digits may appear between `\\x{` and `}`. If a character\nother than a hexadecimal digit appears between `\\x{` and `}`, or if there is no\nterminating `}`, an error occurs.\n\nCharacters whose code points are less than 256 can be defined by either of the\ntwo syntaxes for `\\x` or by an octal sequence. There is no difference in the way\nthey are handled. For example, `\\xdc` is exactly the same as `\\x{dc}` or `\\334`.\nHowever, using the braced versions does make such sequences easier to read.\n\nThe `\\N{U+hhh..}` escape sequence is recognized only when PCRE2 is operating in\nUTF mode. Perl also uses `\\N{name}` to specify characters by Unicode name; PCRE2\ndoes not support this. Note that when `\\N` is not followed by an opening brace\n(curly bracket) it has an entirely different meaning, matching any character\nthat is not a newline.\n\nThere are some legacy applications where the escape sequence `\\r` is expected to\nmatch a newline.\n\nAn error occurs if `\\c` is not followed by a character whose ASCII code point\nis in the range 32 to 126. The precise effect of `\\cx` is as follows: if x is a\nlower case letter, it is converted to upper case. Then bit 6 of the character\n(hex 40) is inverted. Thus `\\cA` to `\\cZ` become hex 01 to hex 1A (A is 41, Z is\n5A), but `\\c{` becomes hex 3B ({ is 7B), and `\\c`; becomes hex 7B (; is 3B). If\nthe code unit following `\\c` has a code point less than 32 or greater than 126,\na compile-time error occurs.\n\n_Octal Escapes and Back References_\n\n\nThe escape `\\o` must be followed by a sequence of octal digits, enclosed in\nbraces. An error occurs if this is not the case. This escape provides a way of\nspecifying character code points as octal numbers greater than 0777, and it\nalso allows octal numbers and backreferences to be unambiguously distinguished.\n\nIf braces are not used, after `\\0` up to two further octal digits are read.\n\nInside a character class, when a backslash is followed by any octal digit, up\nto three octal digits are read to generate a code point. Any subsequent digits\nstand for themselves. The sequences `\\8` and `\\9` are treated as the literal\ncharacters \"8\" and \"9\".\n\nOutside a character class, Perl's handling of a backslash followed by a digit\nother than 0 is complicated by ambiguity, and Perl has changed over time,\ncausing PCRE2 also to change.\n\nFor greater clarity and unambiguity, it is best to avoid following \\e by a\ndigit greater than zero. Instead, use `\\o{...}` or `\\x{...}` to specify numerical\ncharacter code points, and `\\g{...}` to specify backreferences.\n\n_Perl Rules for Non-Class Backslash 1-9_\n\n\nAll the digits that follow the backslash are read as a decimal number. If the\nnumber is less than 10, begins with the digit 8 or 9, or if there are at least\nthat many previous capture groups in the expression, the entire sequence is\ntaken as a back reference. Otherwise, up to three octal digits are read to form\na character code. For example:\n\n- **`\\040`** -  is another way of writing an ASCII space\n- **`\\40`** -  is the same, provided there are fewer than 40\nprevious capture groups\n- **`\\7`** -  is always a backreference\n- **`\\11`** -  might be a backreference, or another way of\nwriting a tab\n- **`\\011`** -  is always a tab\n- **`\\0113`** -  is a tab followed by the character \"3\"\n- **`\\113`** -  might be a backreference, otherwise the\ncharacter with octal code 113\n- **`\\377`** -  might be a backreference, otherwise\nthe value 255 (decimal)\n- **`\\81`** -  is always a backreference\n\nNote that octal values of 100 or greater that are specified using this syntax\nmust not be introduced by a leading zero, because no more than three octal\ndigits are ever read.\n\n_Python Rules for Non-Class Backslash 1-9_\n\n\nIf there are at least three octal digits after the backslash, exactly three are\nread as an octal code point number, but the value must be no greater than\n`\\377`, even in modes where higher code point values are supported. Any\nsubsequent digits stand for themselves. If there are fewer than three octal\ndigits, the sequence is taken as a decimal back reference. Thus, for example,\n`\\12` is always a back reference, independent of how many captures there are in\nthe pattern. An error is generated for a reference to a non-existent capturing\ngroup.\n\n_Constraints on Character Values_\n\n\nCharacters that are specified using octal or hexadecimal numbers are\nlimited to certain values, as follows:\n\n- **8-bit non-UTF mode** -  no greater than 0xff\n- **8-bit UTF-8 mode** -  no greater than 0x10ffff and a valid code point\n\nInvalid Unicode code points are all those in the range 0xd800 to 0xdfff (the\nso-called \"surrogate\" code points).\n\n_Escape Sequences in Character Classes_\n\n\nAll the sequences that define a single character value can be used both inside\nand outside character classes. In addition, inside a character class, `\\b` is\ninterpreted as the backspace character (hex 08).\n\nWhen not followed by an opening brace, `\\N` is not allowed in a character class.\n`\\B`, `\\R`, and `\\X` are not special inside a character class. Like other\nunrecognized alphabetic escape sequences, they cause an error. Outside a\ncharacter class, these sequences have different meanings.\n\n_Unsupported Escape Sequences_\n\n\nIn Perl, the sequences `\\F`, `\\l`, `\\L`, `\\u`, and `\\U` are recognized by its string\nhandler and used to modify the case of following characters. By default, PCRE2\ndoes not support these escape sequences in patterns.\n\n_Absolute and Relative Backreferences_\n\n\nThe sequence `\\g` followed by a signed or unsigned number, optionally enclosed\nin braces, is an absolute or relative backreference. A named backreference\ncan be coded as `\\g{name}`. Backreferences are discussed\nlater,\nfollowing the discussion of\nparenthesized groups.\n\n_Absolute and Relative Subroutine Calls_\n\n\nFor compatibility with Oniguruma, the non-Perl syntax `\\g` followed by a name or\na number enclosed either in angle brackets or single quotes, is an alternative\nsyntax for referencing a capture group as a subroutine. Details are discussed\nlater.\nNote that `\\g{...}` (Perl syntax) and `\\g<...>` (Oniguruma syntax) are _not_\nsynonymous. The former is a backreference; the latter is a\nsubroutine\ncall.\n\n[](){: #sect3.2}\n_Generic Character Types_\n\n\nAnother use of backslash is for specifying generic character types:\n\n- **`\\d`** -  any decimal digit\n- **`\\D`** -  any character that is not a decimal digit\n- **`\\h`** -  any horizontal white space character\n- **`\\H`** -  any character that is not a horizontal white space character\n- **`\\N`** -  any character that is not a newline\n- **`\\s`** -  any white space character\n- **`\\S`** -  any character that is not a white space character\n- **`\\v`** -  any vertical white space character\n- **`\\V`** -  any character that is not a vertical white space character\n- **`\\w`** -  any \"word\" character\n- **`\\W`** -  any \"non-word\" character\n\nThe `\\N` escape sequence has the same meaning as\nthe \".\" metacharacter\nwhen `dotall` is not set, but setting `dotall` does not change the\nmeaning of `\\N`. Note that when `\\N` is followed by an opening brace it has a\ndifferent meaning. See [Non-Printing Characters](`m:re#sect3.1`). Perl also uses `\\N{name}` to specify characters by Unicode\nname; PCRE2 does not support this.\n\nEach pair of lower and upper case escape sequences partitions the complete set\nof characters into two disjoint sets. Any given character matches one, and only\none, of each pair. The sequences can appear both inside and outside character\nclasses. They each match one character of the appropriate type. If the current\nmatching point is at the end of the subject string, all of them fail, because\nthere is no character to match.\n\nThe default `\\s` characters are HT (9), LF (10), VT (11), FF (12), CR (13), and\nspace (32), which are defined as white space in the \"C\" locale. This list may\nvary if locale-specific matching is taking place. For example, in some locales\nthe \"non-breaking space\" character (`\\xA0`) is recognized as white space, and in\nothers the VT character is not.\n\nA \"word\" character is an underscore or any character that is a letter or digit.\nBy default, the definition of letters and digits is controlled by PCRE2's\nlow-valued character tables, and may vary if locale-specific matching is taking\nplace. For example, in a French locale such as \"fr_FR\" in Unix-like systems,\nor \"french\" in Windows, some character codes greater than 127 are used for\naccented letters, and these are then matched by `\\w`. The use of locales with\nUnicode is discouraged.\n\nBy default, characters whose code points are greater than 127 never match `\\d`,\n`\\s`, or `\\w`, and always match `\\D`, `\\S`, and `\\W`, although this may be different\nfor characters in the range 128-255 when locale-specific matching is happening.\nThese escape sequences retain their original meanings from before Unicode\nsupport was available, mainly for efficiency reasons. If the `ucp` option\nis set, the behaviour is changed so that Unicode properties are used to\ndetermine character types, as follows:\n\n- **`\\d`** - Any character that matches `\\p{Nd}` (decimal digit)\n\n- **`\\s`** - Any character that matches `\\p{Z}` or `\\h` or `\\v`\n\n- **`\\w`** - Any character that matches `\\p{L}`, `\\p{N}`, `\\p{Mn}`, or `\\p{Pc}`\n\n\nThe addition of `\\p{Mn}` (non-spacing mark) and the replacement of an explicit\ntest for underscore with a test for `\\p{Pc}` (connector punctuation) happened in\nPCRE2 release 10.43. This brings PCRE2 into line with Perl.\n\nThe upper case escapes match the inverse sets of characters. Note that `\\d`\nmatches only decimal digits, whereas `\\w` matches any Unicode digit, as well as\nother character categories. Note also that `ucp` affects `\\b`, and\n`\\B` because they are defined in terms of `\\w` and `\\W`. Matching these sequences\nis noticeably slower when `ucp` is set.\n\nThe effect of `ucp` on any one of these escape sequences can be negated by\nthe options within\na pattern by means of an [Internal Option Setting](`m:re#sect10`).\n\nThe sequences `\\h`, `\\H`, `\\v`, and `\\V`, in contrast to the other sequences, which\nmatch only ASCII characters by default, always match a specific list of code\npoints, whether or not `ucp` is set. The horizontal space characters are:\n\n- **U+0009** -  Horizontal tab (HT)\n\n- **U+0020** -  Space\n\n- **U+00A0** -  Non-break space\n\n- **U+1680** -  Ogham space mark\n\n- **U+180E** -  Mongolian vowel separator\n\n- **U+2000** -  En quad\n\n- **U+2001** -  Em quad\n\n- **U+2002** -  En space\n\n- **U+2003** -  Em space\n\n- **U+2004** -  Three-per-em space\n\n- **U+2005** -  Four-per-em space\n\n- **U+2006** -  Six-per-em space\n\n- **U+2007** -  Figure space\n\n- **U+2008** -  Punctuation space\n\n- **U+2009** -  Thin space\n\n- **U+200A** -  Hair space\n\n- **U+202F** -  Narrow no-break space\n\n- **U+205F** -  Medium mathematical space\n\n- **U+3000** -  Ideographic space\n\nThe vertical space characters are:\n\n- **U+000A** -  Linefeed (LF)\n\n- **U+000B** -  Vertical tab (VT)\n\n- **U+000C** -  Form feed (FF)\n\n- **U+000D** -  Carriage return (CR)\n\n- **U+0085** -  Next line (NEL)\n\n- **U+2028** -  Line separator\n\n- **U+2029** -  Paragraph separator\n\nIn 8-bit, non-UTF-8 mode, only the characters with code points less than 256\nare relevant.\n\n[](){: #sect3.3}\n_Newline Sequences_\n\n\nOutside a character class, by default, the escape sequence `\\R` matches any\nUnicode newline sequence. In 8-bit non-UTF-8 mode `\\R` is equivalent to the\nfollowing:\n\n```text\n(?>\\r\\n|\\n|\\x0b|\\f|\\r|\\x85)\n```\n\nThis is an example of an \"atomic group\", details of which are given\nbelow.\nThis particular group matches either the two-character sequence CR followed by\nLF, or one of the single characters LF (linefeed, U+000A), VT (vertical tab,\nU+000B), FF (form feed, U+000C), CR (carriage return, U+000D), or NEL (next\nline, U+0085). Because this is an atomic group, the two-character sequence is\ntreated as a single unit that cannot be split.\n\nIn other modes, two additional characters whose code points are greater than 255\nare added: LS (line separator, U+2028) and PS (paragraph separator, U+2029).\nUnicode support is not needed for these characters to be recognized.\n\nIt is possible to restrict `\\R` to match only CR, LF, or CRLF (instead of the\ncomplete set of Unicode line endings) by setting the option `bsr_anycrlf`\nat compile time. (BSR is an abbreviation for \"backslash R\".) This can be made\nthe default when PCRE2 is built; if this is the case, the other behaviour can\nbe requested via the `bsr_anycrlf` option. It is also possible to specify\nthese settings by starting a pattern string with one of the following\nsequences:\n\n- **(*BSR_ANYCRLF)** -  CR, LF, or CRLF only\n- **(*BSR_UNICODE)** -  any Unicode newline sequence\n\nThese override the default and the options given to the compiling function.\nNote that these special settings, which are not Perl-compatible, are recognized\nonly at the very start of a pattern, and that they must be in upper case. If\nmore than one of them is present, the last one is used. They can be combined\nwith a change of newline convention; for example, a pattern can start with:\n\n```text\n(*ANY)(*BSR_ANYCRLF)\n```\n\nThey can also be combined with the `(*UTF)` or `(*UCP)` special sequences. Inside a\ncharacter class, `\\R` is treated as an unrecognized escape sequence, and causes\nan error.\n\n_Unicode Character Properties_\n\n\nWhen PCRE2 is built with Unicode support (the default), three additional escape\nsequences that match characters with specific properties are available. They\ncan be used in any mode, though in 8-bit non-UTF modes these\nsequences are of course limited to testing characters whose code points are\nless than U+0100.\n\nMatching characters by Unicode property is not fast, because PCRE2 has to do a\nmultistage table lookup in order to find a character's property. That is why\nthe traditional escape sequences such as `\\d` and `\\w` do not use Unicode\nproperties in PCRE2 by default, though you can make them do so by setting the\n`ucp` option or by starting the pattern with `(*UCP)`.\n\nThe extra escape sequences that provide property support are:\n\n- **`\\p{_xx_}`** -  a character with the \\_xx\\_ property\n- **`\\P{_xx_}`** -  a character without the \\_xx\\_ property\n- **`\\X`** -  a Unicode extended grapheme cluster\n\nFor compatibility with Perl, negation can be specified by including a\ncircumflex between the opening brace and the property. For example, `\\p{^Lu}` is\nthe same as `\\P{Lu}`.\n\nIn accordance with Unicode's \"loose matching\" rules, ASCII white space\ncharacters, hyphens, and underscores are ignored in the properties represented\nby \\_xx\\_ above. As well as the space character, ASCII white space can be\ntab, linefeed, vertical tab, formfeed, or carriage return.\n\nSome properties are specified as a name only; others as a name and a value,\nseparated by a colon or an equals sign. The names and values consist of ASCII\nletters and digits (with one Perl-specific exception, see below). They are not\ncase sensitive. Note, however, that the escapes themselves, `\\p` and `\\P`,\n\\_are\\_ case sensitive. There are abbreviations for many names. The following\nexamples are all equivalent:\n\n```text\n\\p{bidiclass=al}\n\\p{BC=al}\n\\p{ Bidi_Class : AL }\n\\p{ Bi-di class = Al }\n\\P{ ^ Bi-di class = Al }\n```\nThere is support for Unicode script names, Unicode general category properties,\n\"Any\", which matches any character (including newline), Bidi_Class, a number of\nbinary (yes/no) properties, and some special PCRE2 properties (described\nbelow).\nCertain other Perl properties such as \"InMusicalSymbols\" are not supported by\nPCRE2. Note that `\\P{Any}` does not match any characters, so always causes a\nmatch failure.\n\n_Script Properties for `\\p` and `\\P`_\n\n\nThere are three different syntax forms for matching a script. Each Unicode\ncharacter has a basic script and, optionally, a list of other scripts (\"Script\nExtensions\") with which it is commonly used. Using the Adlam script as an\nexample, `\\p{sc:Adlam}` matches characters whose basic script is Adlam, whereas\n`\\p{scx:Adlam}` matches, in addition, characters that have Adlam in their\nextensions list. The full names \"script\" and \"script extensions\" for the\nproperty types are recognized and, as for all property specifications, an\nequals sign is an alternative to the colon. If a script name is given without a\nproperty type, for example, `\\p{Adlam}`, it is treated as `\\p{scx:Adlam}`. Perl\nchanged to this interpretation at release 5.26 and PCRE2 changed at release\n10.40.\n\nUnassigned characters are assigned the \"Unknown\" script. Others that are not\npart of an identified script are lumped together as \"Common\".\n\n_The General Category Property for `\\p` and `\\P`_\n\n\nEach character has exactly one Unicode general category property, specified by\na two-letter abbreviation. If only one letter is specified with `\\p` or `\\P`, it\nincludes all the general category properties that start with that letter. In\nthis case, in the absence of negation, the curly brackets in the escape\nsequence are optional; these two examples have the same effect:\n\n```text\n\\p{L}\n\\pL\n```\n\nThe following general category property codes are supported:\n\n- **C** -  Other\n- **Cc** -  Control\n- **Cf** -  Format\n- **Cn** -  Unassigned\n- **Co** -  Private use\n- **Cs** -  Surrogate\n- **L** -  Letter\n- **Lc** -  Cased letter\n- **Ll** -  Lower case letter\n- **Lm** -  Modifier letter\n- **Lo** -  Other letter\n- **Lt** -  Title case letter\n- **Lu** -  Upper case letter\n- **M** -  Mark\n- **Mc** -  Spacing mark\n- **Me** -  Enclosing mark\n- **Mn** -  Non-spacing mark\n- **N** -  Number\n- **Nd** -  Decimal number\n- **Nl** -  Letter number\n- **No** -  Other number\n- **P** -  Punctuation\n- **Pc** -  Connector punctuation\n- **Pd** -  Dash punctuation\n- **Pe** -  Close punctuation\n- **Pf** -  Final punctuation\n- **Pi** -  Initial punctuation\n- **Po** -  Other punctuation\n- **Ps** -  Open punctuation\n- **S** -  Symbol\n- **Sc** -  Currency symbol\n- **Sk** -  Modifier symbol\n- **Sm** -  Mathematical symbol\n- **So** -  Other symbol\n- **Z** -  Separator\n- **Zl** -  Line separator\n- **Zp** -  Paragraph separator\n- **Zs** -  Space separator\n\nPerl originally used the name L& for the Lc property. This is still supported\nby Perl, but discouraged. PCRE2 also still supports it. This property matches\nany character that has the Lu, Ll, or Lt property, in other words, any letter\nthat is not classified as a modifier or \"other\". From release 10.45 of PCRE2\nthe properties Lu, Ll, and Lt are all treated as Lc when case-independent\nmatching is set by the `caseless` option or (?i) within the pattern. The\nother properties are not affected by caseless matching.\n\nThe Cs (Surrogate) property applies only to characters whose code points are in\nthe range U+D800 to U+DFFF.\nHowever, they are not valid in Unicode strings and so cannot be tested by PCRE2\nin UTF mode.\n\nThe long synonyms for property names that Perl supports (such as `\\p{Letter}`)\nare not supported by PCRE2, nor is it permitted to prefix any of these\nproperties with \"Is\".\n\nNo character that is in the Unicode table has the Cn (unassigned) property.\nInstead, this property is assumed for any code point that is not in the\nUnicode table.\n\n_Binary (Yes/No) Properties for `\\p` and `\\P`_\n\n\nUnicode defines a number of binary properties, that is, properties whose only\nvalues are true or false. You can obtain a list of those that are recognized by\n`\\p` and `\\P`, along with their abbreviations, by running this command:\n\n```text\npcre2test -LP\n```\n\n_The Bidi_Class Property for `\\p` and `\\P`_\n\n\n- **`\\p{Bidi_Class: }`** -  matches a character with the given class\n- **`\\p{BC: }`** -  matches a character with the given class\n\nThe recognized classes are:\n\n- **AL** -  Arabic letter\n- **AN** -  Arabic number\n- **B** -  paragraph separator\n- **BN** -  boundary neutral\n- **CS** -  common separator\n- **EN** -  European number\n- **ES** -  European separator\n- **ET** -  European terminator\n- **FSI** -  first strong isolate\n- **L** -  left-to-right\n- **LRE** -  left-to-right embedding\n- **LRI** -  left-to-right isolate\n- **LRO** -  left-to-right override\n- **NSM** -  non-spacing mark\n- **ON** -  other neutral\n- **PDF** -  pop directional format\n- **PDI** -  pop directional isolate\n- **R** -  right-to-left\n- **RLE** -  right-to-left embedding\n- **RLI** -  right-to-left isolate\n- **RLO** -  right-to-left override\n- **S** -  segment separator\n- **WS** -  white space\n\nAs in all property specifications, an equals sign may be used instead of a\ncolon and the class names are case-insensitive. Only the short names listed\nabove are recognized; PCRE2 does not at present support any long alternatives.\n\n_Extended Grapheme Clusters_\n\n\nThe `\\X` escape matches any number of Unicode characters that form an \"extended\ngrapheme cluster\", and treats the sequence as an atomic group\n(see below).\nUnicode supports various kinds of composite character by giving each character\na grapheme breaking property, and having rules that use these properties to\ndefine the boundaries of extended grapheme clusters. The rules are defined in\nUnicode Standard Annex 29, \"Unicode Text Segmentation\". Unicode 11.0.0\nabandoned the use of some previous properties that had been used for emojis.\nInstead it introduced various emoji-specific properties. PCRE2 uses only the\nExtended Pictographic property.\n\n`\\X` always matches at least one character. Then it decides whether to add\nadditional characters according to the following rules for ending a cluster:\n\n1. End at the end of the subject string.\n\n2. Do not end between CR and LF; otherwise end after any control character.\n\n3. Do not break Hangul (a Korean script) syllable sequences. Hangul characters\nare of five types: L, V, T, LV, and LVT. An L character may be followed by an\nL, V, LV, or LVT character; an LV or V character may be followed by a V or T\ncharacter; an LVT or T character may be followed only by a T character.\n\n4. Do not end before extending characters or spacing marks or the zero-width\njoiner (ZWJ) character. Characters with the \"mark\" property always have the\n\"extend\" grapheme breaking property.\n\n5. Do not end after prepend characters.\n\n6. Do not end within emoji modifier sequences or emoji ZWJ (zero-width\njoiner) sequences. An emoji ZWJ sequence consists of a character with the\nExtended_Pictographic property, optionally followed by one or more characters\nwith the Extend property, followed by the ZWJ character, followed by another\nExtended_Pictographic character.\n\n7. Do not break within emoji flag sequences. That is, do not break between\nregional indicator (RI) characters if there are an odd number of RI characters\nbefore the break point.\n\n8. Otherwise, end the cluster.\n\n_PCRE2's Additional Properties_\n\n\nAs well as the standard Unicode properties described above, PCRE2 supports four\nmore that make it possible to convert traditional escape sequences such as `\\w`\nand `\\s` to use Unicode properties. PCRE2 uses these non-standard, non-Perl\nproperties internally when `ucp` is set. However, they may also be used\nexplicitly. These properties are:\n\n- **Xan** -  Any alphanumeric character\n- **Xps** -  Any POSIX space character\n- **Xsp** -  Any Perl space character\n- **Xwd** -  Any Perl \"word\" character\n\nXan matches characters that have either the L (letter) or the N (number)\nproperty. Xps matches the characters tab, linefeed, vertical tab, form feed, or\ncarriage return, and any other character that has the Z (separator) property\n(this includes the space character). Xsp is the same as Xps; in PCRE1 it used\nto exclude vertical tab, for Perl compatibility, but Perl changed. Xwd matches\nthe same characters as Xan, plus those that match Mn (non-spacing mark) or Pc\n(connector punctuation, which includes underscore).\n\nThere is another non-standard property, Xuc, which matches any character that\ncan be represented by a Universal Character Name in C++ and other programming\nlanguages. These are the characters $, @, \\` (grave accent), and all characters\nwith Unicode code points greater than or equal to U+00A0, except for the\nsurrogates U+D800 to U+DFFF. Note that most base (ASCII) characters are\nexcluded. (Universal Character Names are of the form `\\uHHHH` or `\\UHHHHHHH`H\nwhere H is a hexadecimal digit. Note that the Xuc property does not match these\nsequences but the characters that they represent.)\n\n_Resetting the Match Start_\n\n\nIn normal use, the escape sequence `\\K` causes any previously matched characters\nnot to be included in the final matched sequence that is returned. For example,\nthe pattern:\n\n```text\nfoo\\Kbar\n```\n\nmatches \"foobar\", but reports that it has matched \"bar\". `\\K` does not interact\nwith anchoring in any way. The pattern:\n\n```text\n^foo\\Kbar\n```\n\nmatches only when the subject begins with \"foobar\" (in single line mode),\nthough it again reports the matched string as \"bar\". This feature is similar to\na lookbehind assertion\n(described below),\nbut the part of the pattern that precedes `\\K` is not constrained to match a\nlimited number of characters, as is required for a lookbehind assertion. The\nuse of `\\K` does not interfere with the setting of\ncaptured substrings.\nFor example, when the pattern\n\n```text\n(foo)\\Kbar\n```\n\nmatches \"foobar\", the first substring is still set to \"foo\".\n\nFrom version 5.32.0 Perl forbids the use of `\\K` in lookaround assertions. From\nrelease 10.38 PCRE2 also forbids this by default.\n\n_Simple Assertions_\n\n\nThe final use of backslash is for certain simple assertions. An assertion\nspecifies a condition that has to be met at a particular point in a match,\nwithout consuming any characters from the subject string. The use of\ngroups for more complicated assertions is described\nbelow.\nThe backslashed assertions are:\n\n- **`\\b`** -  matches at a word boundary\n- **`\\B`** -  matches when not at a word boundary\n- **`\\A`** -  matches at the start of the subject\n- **`\\Z`** -  matches at the end of the subject\nalso matches before a newline at the end of the subject\n- **`\\z`** -  matches only at the end of the subject\n- **`\\G`** -  matches at the first matching position in the subject\n\nInside a character class, `\\b` has a different meaning; it matches the backspace\ncharacter. If any other of these assertions appears in a character class, an\n\"invalid escape sequence\" error is generated.\n\nA word boundary is a position in the subject string where the current character\nand the previous character do not both match `\\w` or `\\W` (i.e. one matches\n`\\w` and the other matches `\\W`), or the start or end of the string if the\nfirst or last character matches `\\w`, respectively. When PCRE2 is built with\nUnicode support, the meanings of `\\w` and `\\W` can be changed by setting the\n`ucp` option. When this is done, it also affects `\\b` and `\\B`. Neither PCRE2\nnor Perl has a separate \"start of word\" or \"end of word\" metasequence. However,\nwhatever follows `\\b` normally determines which it is. For example, the fragment\n`\\ba` matches \"a\" at the start of a word.\n\nThe `\\A`, `\\Z`, and `\\z` assertions differ from the traditional circumflex and\ndollar (described in the next section) in that they only ever match at the very\nstart and end of the subject string, whatever options are set. Thus, they are\nindependent of multiline mode. These three assertions are not affected by the\n`notbol` or `noteol` options, which affect only the behaviour of the\ncircumflex and dollar metacharacters. However, if the _startoffset_\nargument of `run/3` is non-zero, indicating that matching is to\nstart at a point other than the beginning of the subject, `\\A` can never match.\nThe difference between `\\Z` and `\\z` is that `\\Z` matches before a newline at the\nend of the string as well as at the very end, whereas `\\z` matches only at the\nend.\n\nThe `\\G` assertion is true only when the current matching position is at the\nstart point of the matching process, as specified by the _startoffset_\nargument of `run/3`. It differs from `\\A` when the value of\n_startoffset_ is non-zero. By calling `run/3` multiple times\nwith appropriate arguments, you can mimic Perl's /g option, and it is in this\nkind of implementation where `\\G` can be useful.\n\nNote, however, that PCRE2's implementation of `\\G`, being true at the starting\ncharacter of the matching process, is subtly different from Perl's, which\ndefines it as true at the end of the previous match. In Perl, these can be\ndifferent when the previously matched string was empty. Because PCRE2 does just\none match at a time, it cannot reproduce this behaviour.\n\nIf all the alternatives of a pattern begin with `\\G`, the expression is anchored\nto the starting match position, and the \"anchored\" flag is set in the compiled\nregular expression.\n\n[](){: #sect4 }","ref":"re.html#module-backslash"},{"type":"module","title":"Circumflex and Dollar - re","doc":"The circumflex and dollar metacharacters are zero-width assertions.

These two metacharacters are concerned with\nmatching the starts and ends of lines. If the newline convention is set so that\nonly the two-character sequence CRLF is recognized as a newline, isolated CR\nand LF characters are treated as ordinary data characters, and are not\nrecognized as newlines.\n\nOutside a character class, in the default matching mode, the circumflex\ncharacter is an assertion that is true only if the current matching point is at\nthe start of the subject string. If the _startoffset_ argument of\n`run/3` is non-zero, or if `notbol` is set, circumflex can\nnever match if the `multiline` option is unset. Inside a character class,\ncircumflex has an entirely different meaning\n(see below).\n\nCircumflex need not be the first character of the pattern if a number of\nalternatives are involved, but it should be the first thing in each alternative\nin which it appears if the pattern is ever to match that branch. If all\npossible alternatives start with a circumflex, that is, if the pattern is\nconstrained to match only at the start of the subject, it is said to be an\n\"anchored\" pattern. (There are also other constructs that can cause a pattern\nto be anchored.)\n\nThe dollar character is an assertion that is true only if the current matching\npoint is at the end of the subject string, or immediately before a newline at\nthe end of the string (by default), unless `noteol` is set. Note, however,\nthat it does not actually match the newline. Dollar need not be the last\ncharacter of the pattern if a number of alternatives are involved, but it\nshould be the last item in any branch in which it appears. Dollar has no\nspecial meaning in a character class.\n\nThe meaning of dollar can be changed so that it matches only at the very end of\nthe string, by setting the `dollar_endonly` option at compile time. This\ndoes not affect the `\\Z` assertion.\n\nThe meanings of the circumflex and dollar metacharacters are changed if the\n`multiline` option is set. When this is the case, a dollar character\nmatches before any newlines in the string, as well as at the very end, and a\ncircumflex matches immediately after internal newlines as well as at the start\nof the subject string. It does not match after a newline that ends the string,\nfor compatibility with Perl.\n\nFor example, the pattern /^abc$/ matches the subject string \"def\\nabc\" (where\n`\\n` represents a newline) in multiline mode, but not otherwise. Consequently,\npatterns that are anchored in single line mode because all branches start with\n^ are not anchored in multiline mode, and a match for circumflex is possible\nwhen the _startoffset_ argument of `run/3` is non-zero. The\n`dollar_endonly` option is ignored if `multiline` is set.\n\nWhen the [Newline Conventions](`m:re#sect1.1`) recognizes the two-character sequence CRLF as a newline, this is\npreferred, even if the single characters CR and LF are also recognized as\nnewlines. For example, if the newline convention is \"any\", a multiline mode\ncircumflex matches before \"xyz\" in the string \"abc\\r\\nxyz\" rather than after\nCR, even though CR on its own is a valid newline. (It also matches at the very\nstart of the string, of course.)\n\nNote that the sequences `\\A`, `\\Z`, and `\\z` can be used to match the start and\nend of the subject in both modes, and if all branches of a pattern start with\n`\\A` it is always anchored, whether or not `multiline` is set.\n\n[](){: #sect5 }","ref":"re.html#module-circumflex-and-dollar"},{"type":"module","title":"Full Stop (Period, Dot) and \\N - re","doc":"Outside a character class, a dot in the pattern matches any one character in\nthe subject string except (by default) a character that signifies the end of a\nline.

When ANYCRLF is selected for line endings, no occurrences\nof CR of LF match dot. When all Unicode line endings are being recognized, dot\ndoes not match CR or LF or any of the other line ending characters.\n\nThe behaviour of dot with regard to newlines can be changed. If the\n`dotall` option is set, a dot matches any one character, without exception.\nIf the two-character sequence CRLF is present in the subject string, it takes\ntwo dots to match it.\n\nThe handling of dot is entirely independent of the handling of circumflex and\ndollar, the only relationship being that they both involve newlines. Dot has no\nspecial meaning in a character class.\n\nThe escape sequence `\\N` when not followed by an opening brace behaves like a\ndot, except that it is not affected by the `dotall` option. In other words,\nit matches any character except one that signifies the end of a line.\n\nWhen `\\N` is followed by an opening brace it has a different meaning.

The\nfeature is provided in Perl in order to match individual bytes in UTF-8 mode,\nbut it is unclear how it can usefully be used.\n\nBecause `\\C` breaks up characters into individual code units, matching one unit\nwith `\\C` in UTF-8 mode means that the rest of the string may start\nwith a malformed UTF character. This has undefined results, because PCRE2\nassumes that it is matching character by character in a valid UTF string (by\ndefault it checks the subject string's validity at the start of processing).\n\nPCRE2 does not allow `\\C` to appear in lookbehind assertions\n(described below)\nin UTF-8 mode, because this would make it impossible to calculate\nthe length of the lookbehind.\n\nIn general, the `\\C` escape sequence is best avoided.

A closing square bracket on its own is not special by default.\nIf a closing square bracket is required as a member of the class, it should be\nthe first data character in the class (after an initial circumflex, if present)\nor escaped with a backslash. This means that, by default, an empty class cannot\nbe defined.\n\nA character class matches a single character in the subject. A matched\ncharacter must be in the set of characters defined by the class, unless the\nfirst character in the class definition is a circumflex, in which case the\nsubject character must not be in the set defined by the class. If a circumflex\nis actually required as a member of the class, ensure it is not the first\ncharacter, or escape it with a backslash.\n\nFor example, the character class [aeiou] matches any lower case English vowel,\nwhereas [^aeiou] matches all other characters. Note that a circumflex is just a\nconvenient notation for specifying the characters that are in the class by\nenumerating those that are not. A class that starts with a circumflex is not an\nassertion; it still consumes a character from the subject string, and therefore\nit fails to match if the current pointer is at the end of the string.\n\nCharacters in a class may be specified by their code points using `\\o`, `\\x`, or\n`\\N{U+hh..}` in the usual way. When caseless matching is set, any letters in a\nclass represent both their upper case and lower case versions, so for example,\na caseless [aeiou] matches \"A\" as well as \"a\", and a caseless [^aeiou] does not\nmatch \"A\", whereas a caseful version would. Note that there are two ASCII\ncharacters, K and S, that, in addition to their lower case ASCII equivalents,\nare case-equivalent with Unicode U+212A (Kelvin sign) and U+017F (long S)\nrespectively when either `unicode` or `ucp` is set.\n\nCharacters that might indicate line breaks are never treated in any special way\nwhen matching character classes, whatever line-ending sequence is in use, and\nwhatever setting of the `dotall` and `multiline` options is used. A\nclass such as [^a] always matches one of these characters.\n\nThe generic character type escape sequences `\\d`, `\\D`, `\\h`, `\\H`, `\\p`, `\\P`, `\\s`,\n`\\S`, `\\v`, `\\V`, `\\w`, and `\\W` may appear in a character class, and add the\ncharacters that they match to the class. For example, [`\\dABCDEF]` matches any\nhexadecimal digit. In UTF modes, the `ucp` option affects the meanings of\n`\\d`, `\\s`, `\\w` and their upper case partners, just as it does when they appear\noutside a character class, as described in\n[Generic character types](`m:re#sect3.2`).\nThe escape sequence `\\b` has a different meaning inside a character\nclass; it matches the backspace character. The sequences `\\B`, `\\R`, and `\\X` are\nnot special inside a character class. Like any other unrecognized escape\nsequences, they cause an error. The same is true for `\\N` when not followed by\nan opening brace.\n\nThe minus (hyphen) character can be used to specify a range of characters in a\ncharacter class. For example, [d-m] matches any letter between d and m,\ninclusive. If a minus character is required in a class, it must be escaped with\na backslash or appear in a position where it cannot be interpreted as\nindicating a range, typically as the first or last character in the class,\nor immediately after a range. For example, [b-d-z] matches letters in the range\nb to d, a hyphen character, or z.\n\nPerl treats a hyphen as a literal if it appears before or after a POSIX class\n(see below) or before or after a character type escape such as `\\d` or `\\H`.\nHowever, unless the hyphen is the last character in the class, Perl outputs a\nwarning in its warning mode, as this is most likely a user error. As PCRE2 has\nno facility for warning, an error is given in these cases.\n\nIt is not possible to have the literal character \"]\" as the end character of a\nrange. A pattern such as `[W-]46]` is interpreted as a class of two characters\n(\"W\" and \"-\") followed by a literal string \"46]\", so it would match \"W46]\" or\n\"-46]\". However, if the \"]\" is escaped with a backslash it is interpreted as\nthe end of a range, so `[W-\\]46]` is interpreted as a class containing a range\nand two other characters. The octal or hexadecimal representation of\n\"]\" can also be used to end a range.\n\nRanges normally include all code points between the start and end characters,\ninclusive. They can also be used for code points specified numerically, for\nexample `[\\000-\\037]`. Ranges can include any characters that are valid for the\ncurrent mode. In any UTF mode, the so-called \"surrogate\" characters (those\nwhose code points lie between 0xd800 and 0xdfff inclusive) may not be specified\nexplicitly by default. However, ranges such as `[\\x{d7ff}-\\x{e000}]`, which include the\nsurrogates, are always permitted.\n\nIf a range that includes letters is used when caseless matching is set, it\nmatches the letters in either case. For example, `[W-c]` is equivalent to\n``[][\\^_`wxyzabc]``, matched caselessly, and in a non-UTF mode, if character\ntables for a French locale are in use, `[\\xc8-\\xcb]` matches accented E\ncharacters in both cases.\n\nA circumflex can conveniently be used with the upper case character types to\nspecify a more restricted set of characters than the matching lower case type.\nFor example, the class `[^\\W_]` matches any letter or digit, but not underscore,\nwhereas `[\\w]` includes underscore. A positive character class should be read as\n\"something OR something OR ...\" and a negative class as \"NOT something AND NOT\nsomething AND NOT ...\".\n\nThe metacharacters that are recognized in character classes are backslash,\nhyphen (when it can be interpreted as specifying a range), circumflex\n(only at the start), and the terminating closing square bracket. An opening\nsquare bracket is also special when it can be interpreted as introducing a\nPOSIX class (see \"Posix character classes\" below), or a special compatibility feature (see\nCompatibility feature for word boundaries\" below).\nEscaping any non-alphanumeric character in a class turns it into a\nliteral, whether or not it would otherwise be a metacharacter.\n\n[](){: #sect7X}","ref":"re.html#module-square-brackets-and-character-classes"},{"type":"module","title":"Perl Extended Character Classes - re","doc":"From release 10.45 PCRE2 supports Perl's `(?[...])` extended character class\nsyntax.

The example above provokes a\n> compile-time error. However, there is still scope for confusion. Consider this\n> pattern:\n>\n> ```text\n> (?|(? aa)|(bb))\n> ```\n>\n> Although the second group number 1 is not explicitly named, the name AA is\n> still an alias for any group 1. Whether the pattern matches \"aa\" or \"bb\", a\n> reference by name to group AA yields the matched string.\n\nBy default, a name must be unique within a pattern, except that duplicate names\nare permitted for groups with the same number, for example:\n\n```text\n(?|(? aa)|(? bb))\n```\n\nThe duplicate name constraint can be disabled by setting the `dupnames`\noption at compile time, or by the use of `(?J)` within the pattern, see [Internal Option Setting](`m:re#sect10`).\n\nDuplicate names can be useful for patterns where only one instance of the named\ncapture group can match. Suppose you want to match the name of a weekday,\neither as a 3-letter abbreviation or as the full name, and in both cases you\nwant to extract the abbreviation. This pattern (ignoring the line breaks) does\nthe job:\n\n```text\n(?J)\n(? Mon|Fri|Sun)(?:day)?|\n(? Tue)(?:sday)?|\n(? Wed)(?:nesday)?|\n(? Thu)(?:rsday)?|\n(? Sat)(?:urday)?\n```\n\nThere are five capture groups, but only one is ever set after a match. The\nconvenience functions for extracting the data by name returns the substring for\nthe first (and in this example, the only) group of that name that matched. This\nsaves searching to find which numbered group it was. (An alternative way of\nsolving this problem is to use a \"branch reset\" group, as described in the\nprevious section.)\n\nIf you make a backreference to a non-unique named group from elsewhere in the\npattern, the groups to which the name refers are checked in the order in which\nthey appear in the overall pattern. The first one that is set is used for the\nreference. For example, this pattern matches both \"foofoo\" and \"barbar\" but not\n\"foobar\" or \"barfoo\":\n\n```text\n(?J)(?:(? foo)|(? bar))\\k \n```\n\nIf you make a subroutine call to a non-unique named group, the one that\ncorresponds to the first occurrence of the name is used. In the absence of\nduplicate numbers this is the one with the lowest number.\n\nIf you use a named reference in a condition\ntest (see the section about conditions below), either to check whether a capture group has matched, or to check for\nrecursion, all groups with the same name are tested. If the condition is true\nfor any one of them, the overall condition is true. This is the same behaviour\nas testing by number.\n\n[](){: #sect14}","ref":"re.html#module-named-capture-groups"},{"type":"module","title":"Repetition - re","doc":"Repetition is specified by quantifiers, which may follow any one of these\nitems:\n\n```text\na literal data character\nthe dot metacharacter\nthe `\\C` escape sequence\nthe `\\R` escape sequence\nthe `\\X` escape sequence\nany escape sequence that matches a single character\na character class\na backreference\na parenthesized group (including lookaround assertions)\na subroutine call (recursive or otherwise)\n```\n\nIf a quantifier does not follow a repeatable item, an error occurs. The\ngeneral repetition quantifier specifies a minimum and maximum number of\npermitted matches by giving two numbers in curly brackets (braces), separated\nby a comma. The numbers must be less than 65536, and the first must be less\nthan or equal to the second. For example,\n\n```text\nz{2,4}\n```\n\nmatches \"zz\", \"zzz\", or \"zzzz\". A closing brace on its own is not a special\ncharacter. If the second number is omitted, but the comma is present, there is\nno upper limit; if the second number and the comma are both omitted, the\nquantifier specifies an exact number of required matches. Thus\n\n```text\n[aeiou]{3,}\n```\n\nmatches at least 3 successive vowels, but may match many more, whereas\n\n```text\n\\d{8}\n```\n\nmatches exactly 8 digits. If the first number is omitted, the lower limit is\ntaken as zero; in this case the upper limit must be present.\n\n```text\nX{,4} is interpreted as X{0,4}\n```\n\nThis is a change in behaviour that happened in Perl 5.34.0 and PCRE2 10.43. In\nearlier versions such a sequence was not interpreted as a quantifier. Other\nregular expression engines may behave either way.\n\nIf the characters that follow an opening brace do not match the syntax of a\nquantifier, the brace is taken as a literal character. In particular, this\nmeans that `{,}` is a literal string of three characters.\n\nNote that not every opening brace is potentially the start of a quantifier\nbecause braces are used in other items such as `\\N{U+345}` or `\\k{name}`.\n\nIn UTF modes, quantifiers apply to characters rather than to individual code\nunits. Thus, for example, `\\x{100}{2}` matches two characters, each of\nwhich is represented by a two-byte sequence in a UTF-8 string. Similarly,\n`\\X{3}` matches three Unicode extended grapheme clusters, each of which may be\nseveral code units long (and they may be of different lengths).\n\nThe quantifier `{0}` is permitted, causing the expression to behave as if the\nprevious item and the quantifier were not present. This may be useful for\ncapture groups that are referenced as\nsubroutines\nfrom elsewhere in the pattern (see\n[Defining capture groups for use by reference only](`m:re#sect20.1`)).\nExcept for parenthesized groups, items that have a `{0}` quantifier are\nomitted from the compiled pattern.\n\nFor convenience, the three most common quantifiers have single-character\nabbreviations:\n\n- **`*`** -  is equivalent to {0,}\n- **`+`** -  is equivalent to {1,}\n- **`?`** -  is equivalent to {0,1}\n\nIt is possible to construct infinite loops by following a group that can match\nno characters with a quantifier that has no upper limit, for example:\n\n```text\n(a?)*\n```\n\nEarlier versions of Perl and PCRE1 used to give an error at compile time for\nsuch patterns. However, because there are cases where this can be useful, such\npatterns are now accepted, but whenever an iteration of such a group matches no\ncharacters, matching moves on to the next item in the pattern instead of\nrepeatedly matching an empty string. This does not prevent backtracking into\nany of the iterations if a subsequent item fails to match.\n\nBy default, quantifiers are \"greedy\", that is, they match as much as possible\n(up to the maximum number of permitted repetitions), without causing the rest\nof the pattern to fail. The classic example of where this gives problems is in\ntrying to match comments in C programs. These appear between `/*` and `*/` and\nwithin the comment, individual `*`  and `/`  characters may appear. An attempt to\nmatch C comments by applying the pattern\n\n```text\n/\\*.*\\*/\n```\n\nto the string\n\n```text\n/* first comment */  not comment  /* second comment */\n```\n\nfails, because it matches the entire string owing to the greediness of the `.*`\nitem. However, if a quantifier is followed by a question mark, it ceases to be\ngreedy, and instead matches the minimum number of times possible, so the\npattern\n\n```text\n/\\*.*?\\*/\n```\n\ndoes the right thing with C comments. The meaning of the various quantifiers is\nnot otherwise changed, just the preferred number of matches. Do not confuse\nthis use of question mark with its use as a quantifier in its own right.\nBecause it has two uses, it can sometimes appear doubled, as in\n\n```text\n\\d??\\d\n```\n\nwhich matches one digit by preference, but can match two if that is the only\nway the rest of the pattern matches.\n\nIf the `ungreedy` option is set (an option that is not available in Perl),\nthe quantifiers are not greedy by default, but individual ones can be made\ngreedy by following them with a question mark. In other words, it inverts the\ndefault behaviour.\n\nWhen a parenthesized group is quantified with a minimum repeat count that\nis greater than 1 or with a limited maximum, more memory is required for the\ncompiled pattern, in proportion to the size of the minimum or maximum.\n\nIf a pattern starts with `.*` or `.{0,}` and the `dotall` option (equivalent\nto Perl's /s) is set, thus allowing the dot to match newlines, the pattern is\nimplicitly anchored, because whatever follows will be tried against every\ncharacter position in the subject string, so there is no point in retrying the\noverall match at any position after the first. PCRE2 normally treats such a\npattern as though it were preceded by `\\A`.\n\nIn cases where it is known that the subject string contains no newlines, it is\nworth setting `dotall` in order to obtain this optimization, or\nalternatively, using `^`  to indicate anchoring explicitly.\n\nHowever, there are some cases where the optimization cannot be used. When .*\nis inside capturing parentheses that are the subject of a backreference\nelsewhere in the pattern, a match at the start may fail where a later one\nsucceeds. Consider, for example:\n\n```text\n(.*)abc\\1\n```\n\nIf the subject is \"xyz123abc123\" the match point is the fourth character. For\nthis reason, such a pattern is not implicitly anchored.\n\nAnother case where implicit anchoring is not applied is when the leading .* is\ninside an atomic group. Once again, a match at the start may fail where a later\none succeeds. Consider this pattern:\n\n```text\n(?>.*?a)b\n```\n\nIt matches \"ab\" in the subject \"aab\". The use of the backtracking control verbs\n`(*PRUNE)` and `(*SKIP)` also disable this optimization.\n\nWhen a capture group is repeated, the value captured is the substring that\nmatched the final iteration. For example, after\n\n```text\n(tweedle[dume]{3}\\s*)+\n```\n\nhas matched \"tweedledum tweedledee\" the value of the captured substring is\n\"tweedledee\". However, if there are nested capture groups, the corresponding\ncaptured values may have been set in previous iterations. For example, after\n\n```text\n(a|(b))+\n```\n\nmatches \"aba\" the value of the second captured substring is \"b\".\n\n[](){: #sect15}","ref":"re.html#module-repetition"},{"type":"module","title":"Atomic Grouping and Possessive Quantifiers - re","doc":"With both maximizing (\"greedy\") and minimizing (\"ungreedy\" or \"lazy\")\nrepetition, failure of what follows normally causes the repeated item to be\nre-evaluated to see if a different number of repeats allows the rest of the\npattern to match. Sometimes it is useful to prevent this, either to change the\nnature of the match, or to cause it fail earlier than it otherwise might, when\nthe author of the pattern knows there is no point in carrying on.\n\nConsider, for example, the pattern `\\d+foo` when applied to the subject line\n\n```text\n123456bar\n```\n\nAfter matching all 6 digits and then failing to match \"foo\", the normal\naction of the matcher is to try again with only 5 digits matching the `\\d+`\nitem, and then with 4, and so on, before ultimately failing. \"Atomic grouping\"\n(a term taken from Jeffrey Friedl's book) provides the means for specifying\nthat once a group has matched, it is not to be re-evaluated in this way.\n\nIf we use atomic grouping for the previous example, the matcher gives up\nimmediately on failing to match \"foo\" the first time. The notation is a kind of\nspecial parenthesis, starting with `(?>` as in this example:\n\n```text\n(?>\\d+)foo\n```\n\nPerl 5.28 introduced an experimental alphabetic form starting with `(*` which may\nbe easier to remember:\n\n```text\n(*atomic:\\d+)foo\n```\n\nThis kind of parenthesized group \"locks up\" the part of the pattern it contains\nonce it has matched, and a failure further into the pattern is prevented from\nbacktracking into it. Backtracking past it to previous items, however, works as\nnormal.\n\nAn alternative description is that a group of this type matches exactly the\nstring of characters that an identical standalone pattern would match, if\nanchored at the current point in the subject string.\n\nAtomic groups are not capture groups. Simple cases such as the above example\ncan be thought of as a maximizing repeat that must swallow everything it can.\nSo, while both `\\d+` and `\\d+?` are prepared to adjust the number of digits they\nmatch in order to make the rest of the pattern match, `(?>\\d+)` can only match\nan entire sequence of digits.\n\nAtomic groups in general can of course contain arbitrarily complicated\nexpressions, and can be nested. However, when the contents of an atomic\ngroup is just a single repeated item, as in the example above, a simpler\nnotation, called a \"possessive quantifier\" can be used. This consists of an\nadditional `+`  character following a quantifier. Using this notation, the\nprevious example can be rewritten as\n\n```text\n\\d++foo\n```\n\nNote that a possessive quantifier can be used with an entire group, for\nexample:\n\n```text\n(abc|xyz){2,3}+\n```\n\nPossessive quantifiers are always greedy; the setting of the `ungreedy`\noption is ignored. They are a convenient notation for the simpler forms of\natomic group. However, there is no difference in the meaning of a possessive\nquantifier and the equivalent atomic group, though there may be a performance\ndifference; possessive quantifiers should be slightly faster.\n\nThe possessive quantifier syntax is an extension to the Perl 5.8 syntax.\nJeffrey Friedl originated the idea (and the name) in the first edition of his\nbook. Mike McCloskey liked it, so implemented it when he built Sun's Java\npackage, and PCRE1 copied it from there. It found its way into Perl at release\n5.10.\n\nPCRE2 has an optimization that automatically \"possessifies\" certain simple\npattern constructs. For example, the sequence A+B is treated as A++B because\nthere is no point in backtracking into a sequence of A's when B must follow.\nThis feature can be disabled by the PCRE2_NO_AUTO_POSSESS option, by\nstarting the pattern with `(*NO_AUTO_POSSESS)`.\n\nWhen a pattern contains an unlimited repeat inside a group that can itself be\nrepeated an unlimited number of times, the use of an atomic group is the only\nway to avoid some failing matches taking a very long time indeed. The pattern\n\n```text\n(\\D+|<\\d+>)*[!?]\n```\n\nmatches an unlimited number of substrings that either consist of non-digits, or\ndigits enclosed in `<>`, followed by either `!`  or `?`. When it matches, it runs\nquickly. However, if it is applied to\n\n```text\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n```\n\nit takes a long time before reporting failure. This is because the string can\nbe divided between the internal `\\D+` repeat and the external `*`  repeat in a\nlarge number of ways, and all have to be tried. (The example uses `[!?]` rather\nthan a single character at the end, because both PCRE2 and Perl have an\noptimization that allows for fast failure when a single character is used. They\nremember the last single character that is required for a match, and fail early\nif it is not present in the string.) If the pattern is changed so that it uses\nan atomic group, like this:\n\n```text\n((?>\\D+)|<\\d+>)*[!?]\n```\n\nsequences of non-digits cannot be broken, and failure happens quickly.\n\n[](){: #sect16}","ref":"re.html#module-atomic-grouping-and-possessive-quantifiers"},{"type":"module","title":"Backreferences - re","doc":"Outside a character class, a backslash followed by a digit greater than 0 (and\npossibly further digits) is a backreference to a capture group earlier (that\nis, to its left) in the pattern, provided there have been that many previous\ncapture groups.\n\nHowever, if the decimal number following the backslash is less than 8, it is\nalways taken as a backreference, and causes an error only if there are not that\nmany capture groups in the entire pattern. In other words, the group that is\nreferenced need not be to the left of the reference for numbers less than 8. A\n\"forward backreference\" of this type can make sense when a repetition is\ninvolved and the group to the right has participated in an earlier iteration.\n\nIt is not possible to have a numerical \"forward backreference\" to a group whose\nnumber is 8 or more using this syntax because a sequence such as `\\50` is\ninterpreted as a character defined in octal. See [Non-Printing Characters](`m:re#sect3.1`)\nfor further details of the handling of digits following a backslash. Other\nforms of backreferencing do not suffer from this restriction. In particular,\nthere is no problem when [named capture groups](`m:re#sect13`) are used.\n\nAnother way of avoiding the ambiguity inherent in the use of digits following a\nbackslash is to use the `\\g` escape sequence. This escape must be followed by a\nsigned or unsigned number, optionally enclosed in braces. These examples are\nall identical:\n\n```text\n(ring), \\1\n(ring), \\g1\n(ring), \\g{1}\n```\n\nAn unsigned number specifies an absolute reference without the ambiguity that\nis present in the older syntax. It is also useful when literal digits follow\nthe reference. A signed number is a relative reference. Consider this example:\n\n```text\n(abc(def)ghi)\\g{-1}\n```\n\nThe sequence `\\g{-1}` is a reference to the capture group whose number is one\nless than the number of the next group to be started, so in this example (where\nthe next group would be numbered 3) is it equivalent to `\\2`, and `\\g{-2}` would\nbe equivalent to `\\1`. Note that if this construct is inside a capture group,\nthat group is included in the count, so in this example `\\g{-2}` also refers to\ngroup 1:\n\n```text\n(A)(\\g{-2}B)\n```\n\nThe use of relative references can be helpful in long patterns, and also in\npatterns that are created by joining together fragments that contain references\nwithin themselves.\n\nThe sequence `\\g{+1}` is a reference to the next capture group that is started\nafter this item, and `\\g{+2}` refers to the one after that, and so on. This kind\nof forward reference can be useful in patterns that repeat. Perl does not\nsupport the use of `+` in this way.\n\nA backreference matches whatever actually most recently matched the capture\ngroup in the current subject string, rather than anything at all that matches\nthe group (see [Groups as Subroutines](`m:re#sect23`) below for a way of doing that). So the pattern\n\n```text\n(sens|respons)e and \\1ibility\n```\n\nmatches \"sense and sensibility\" and \"response and responsibility\", but not\n\"sense and responsibility\". If caseful matching is in force at the time of the\nbackreference, the case of letters is relevant. For example,\n\n```text\n((?i)rah)\\s+\\1\n```\n\nmatches \"rah rah\" and \"RAH RAH\", but not \"RAH rah\", even though the original\ncapture group is matched caselessly.\n\nThere are several different ways of writing backreferences to named capture\ngroups. The .NET syntax is `\\k{name}`, the Python syntax is `(?=name)`, and the\noriginal Perl syntax is `\\k ` or `\\k'name'`. All of these are now supported\nby both Perl and PCRE2. Perl 5.10's unified backreference syntax, in which `\\g`\ncan be used for both numeric and named references, is also supported by PCRE2.\nWe could rewrite the above example in any of the following ways:\n\n```text\n(? (?i)rah)\\s+\\k \n(?'p1'(?i)rah)\\s+\\k{p1}\n(?P (?i)rah)\\s+(?P=p1)\n(? (?i)rah)\\s+\\g{p1}\n```\nA capture group that is referenced by name may appear in the pattern before or\nafter the reference.\n\nThere may be more than one backreference to the same group. If a group has not\nactually been used in a particular match, backreferences to it always fail by\ndefault. For example, the pattern\n\n```text\n(a|(bc))\\2\n```\n\nalways fails if it starts to match \"a\" rather than \"bc\".\n\nBecause there may be many capture groups in a pattern, all digits following a\nbackslash are taken as part of a potential backreference number. If the pattern\ncontinues with a digit character, some delimiter must be used to terminate the\nbackreference. If the `extended` or PCRE2_EXTENDED_MORE option is set, this\ncan be white space. Otherwise, the `\\g{}` syntax or an empty comment (see\n[Comments](`m:re#sect21`) below) can be used.\n\n_Recursive Backreferences_\n\n\nA backreference that occurs inside the group to which it refers fails when the\ngroup is first used, so, for example, `(a\\1)` never matches. However, such\nreferences can be useful inside repeated groups. For example, the pattern\n\n```text\n(a|b\\1)+\n```\n\nmatches any number of \"a\"s and also \"aba\", \"ababbaa\" etc. At each iteration of\nthe group, the backreference matches the character string corresponding to the\nprevious iteration. In order for this to work, the pattern must be such that\nthe first iteration does not need to match the backreference. This can be done\nusing alternation, as in the example above, or by a quantifier with a minimum\nof zero.\n\nFor versions of PCRE2 less than 10.25, backreferences of this type used to\ncause the group that they reference to be treated as an\natomic group.\nThis restriction no longer applies, and backtracking into such groups can occur\nas normal.\n\n[](){: #sect17}","ref":"re.html#module-backreferences"},{"type":"module","title":"Assertions - re","doc":"An assertion is a test that does not consume any characters. The test must\nsucceed for the match to continue. The simple assertions coded as `\\b`, `\\B`,\n`\\A`, `\\G`, `\\Z`, `\\z`, `^`  and `$`  are described\nabove.\n\nMore complicated assertions are coded as parenthesized groups. If matching such\na group succeeds, matching continues after it, but with the matching position\nin the subject string reset to what it was before the assertion was processed.\n\nA special kind of assertion, called a \"scan substring\" assertion, matches a\nsubpattern against a previously captured substring. This is described in \n[Scan Substring Assertions](`m:re#sect18X`). It is a PCRE2 extension, not\ncompatible with Perl.\n\nThe other goup-based assertions are of two kinds: those that look ahead of the\ncurrent position in the subject string, and those that look behind it, and in\neach case an assertion may be positive (must match for the assertion to be\ntrue) or negative (must not match for the assertion to be true).\n\nThe Perl-compatible lookaround assertions are atomic. If an assertion is true,\nbut there is a subsequent matching failure, there is no backtracking into the\nassertion. However, there are some cases where non-atomic assertions can be\nuseful. PCRE2 has some support for these, described in\n[Non-atomic assertions](`m:re#sect18`), but they are not Perl-compatible.\n\nA lookaround assertion may appear as the condition in a\n[conditional groups](`m:re#sect20`). In this case, the result of matching the\nassertion determines which branch of the condition is followed.\n\nAssertion groups are not capture groups. If an assertion contains capture\ngroups within it, these are counted for the purposes of numbering the capture\ngroups in the whole pattern. Within each branch of an assertion, locally\ncaptured substrings may be referenced in the usual way. For example, a sequence\nsuch as `(.)\\g{-1}` can be used to check that two adjacent characters are the\nsame.\n\nWhen a branch within an assertion fails to match, any substrings that were\ncaptured are discarded (as happens with any pattern branch that fails to\nmatch). A negative assertion is true only when all its branches fail to match;\nthis means that no captured substrings are ever retained after a successful\nnegative assertion. When an assertion contains a matching branch, what happens\ndepends on the type of assertion.\n\nFor a positive assertion, internally captured substrings in the successful\nbranch are retained, and matching continues with the next pattern item after\nthe assertion. For a negative assertion, a matching branch means that the\nassertion is not true. If such an assertion is being used as a condition in a\n[conditional groups](`m:re#sect20`), captured substrings are retained, because matching continues with\nthe \"no\" branch of the condition. For other failing negative assertions,\ncontrol passes to the previous backtracking point, thus discarding any captured\nstrings within the assertion.\n\nMost assertion groups may be repeated; though it makes no sense to assert the\nsame thing several times, the side effect of capturing in positive assertions\nmay occasionally be useful. However, an assertion that forms the condition for\na conditional group may not be quantified. PCRE2 used to restrict the\nrepetition of assertions, but from release 10.35 the only restriction is that\nan unlimited maximum repetition is changed to be one more than the minimum. For\nexample, `{3,}` is treated as `{3,4}`.\n\n_Alphabetic Assertion Names_\n\n\nTraditionally, symbolic sequences such as `(?=` and `(?<=` have been used to\nspecify lookaround assertions. Perl 5.28 introduced some experimental\nalphabetic alternatives which might be easier to remember. They all start with\n`(*` instead of `(?` and must be written using lower case letters. PCRE2 supports\nthe following synonyms:\n\n```text\n(*positive_lookahead:  or (*pla: is the same as (?=\n(*negative_lookahead:  or (*nla: is the same as (?!\n(*positive_lookbehind: or (*plb: is the same as (?<=\n(*negative_lookbehind: or (*nlb: is the same as (?<!\n```\n\nFor example, `(*pla:foo)` is the same assertion as `(?=foo)`. In the following\nsections, the various assertions are described using the original symbolic\nforms.\n\n_Lookahead Assertions_\n\n\nLookahead assertions start with `(?=` for positive assertions and `(?!` for\nnegative assertions. For example,\n\n```text\n\\w+(?=;)\n```\n\nmatches a word followed by a semicolon, but does not include the semicolon in\nthe match, and\n\n```text\nfoo(?!bar)\n```\n\nmatches any occurrence of \"foo\" that is not followed by \"bar\". Note that the\napparently similar pattern\n\n```text\n(?!foo)bar\n```\n\ndoes not find an occurrence of \"bar\" that is preceded by something other than\n\"foo\"; it finds any occurrence of \"bar\" whatsoever, because the assertion\n`(?!foo)` is always true when the next three characters are \"bar\". A\nlookbehind assertion is needed to achieve the other effect.\n\nIf you want to force a matching failure at some point in a pattern, the most\nconvenient way to do it is with `(?!)` because an empty string always matches, so\nan assertion that requires there not to be an empty string must always fail.\nThe backtracking control verb `(*FAIL)` or `(*F)` is a synonym for `(?!)`.\n\n_Lookbehind Assertions_\n\n\nLookbehind assertions start with `(?<=` for positive assertions and `(?<!` for\nnegative assertions. For example,\n\n```text\n(?<!foo)bar\n```\n\ndoes find an occurrence of \"bar\" that is not preceded by \"foo\". The contents of\na lookbehind assertion are restricted such that there must be a known maximum\nto the lengths of all the strings it matches. There are two cases:\n\nIf every top-level alternative matches a fixed length, for example\n\n```text\n(?<=colour|color)\n```\n\nthere is a limit of 65535 characters to the lengths, which do not have to be\nthe same, as this example demonstrates. This is the only kind of lookbehind\nsupported by PCRE2 versions earlier than 10.43.\n\nIn PCRE2 10.43 and later, `run/3` supports lookbehind assertions in\nwhich one or more top-level alternatives can match more than one string length,\nfor example\n\n```text\n(?<=colou?r)\n```\n\nThe maximum matching length for any branch of the lookbehind is limited to a\nvalue set by the calling program (default 255 characters). Unlimited repetition\n(for example `\\d*`) is not supported. In some cases, the escape sequence `\\K`\n(see above)\ncan be used instead of a lookbehind assertion at the start of a pattern to get\nround the length limit restriction.\n\nIn UTF-8, PCRE2 does not allow the `\\C` escape (which matches a\nsingle code unit even in a UTF mode) to appear in lookbehind assertions,\nbecause it makes it impossible to calculate the length of the lookbehind. The\n`\\X` and `\\R` escapes, which can match different numbers of code units, are never\npermitted in lookbehinds.\n\n\"Subroutine\"\ncalls (see below) such as `(?2)` or `(?&X)` are permitted in lookbehinds, as long\nas the called capture group matches a limited-length string. However,\nrecursion,\nthat is, a \"subroutine\" call into a group that is already active,\nis not supported.\n\nPCRE2 supports backreferences in lookbehinds, but only if certain conditions\nare met. There must be no\nuse of `(?|` in the pattern (it creates duplicate group numbers), and if the\nbackreference is by name, the name must be unique. Of course, the referenced\ngroup must itself match a limited length substring. The following pattern\nmatches words containing at least two characters that begin and end with the\nsame character:\n\n```text\n\\b(\\w)\\w++(?<=\\1)\n```\n\nPossessive quantifiers can be used in conjunction with lookbehind assertions to\nspecify efficient matching at the end of subject strings. Consider a simple\npattern such as\n\n```text\nabcd$\n```\n\nwhen applied to a long string that does not match. Because matching proceeds\nfrom left to right, PCRE2 will look for each \"a\" in the subject and then see if\nwhat follows matches the rest of the pattern. If the pattern is specified as\n\n```text\n^.*abcd$\n```\n\nthe initial .* matches the entire string at first, but when this fails (because\nthere is no following \"a\"), it backtracks to match all but the last character,\nthen all but the last two characters, and so on. Once again the search for \"a\"\ncovers the entire string, from right to left, so we are no better off. However,\nif the pattern is written as\n\n```text\n^.*+(?<=abcd)\n```\n\nthere can be no backtracking for the .*+ item because of the possessive\nquantifier; it can match only the entire string. The subsequent lookbehind\nassertion does a single test on the last four characters. If it fails, the\nmatch fails immediately. For long strings, this approach makes a significant\ndifference to the processing time.\n\n_Using Multiple Assertions_\n\n\nSeveral assertions (of any sort) may occur in succession. For example,\n\n```text\n(?<=`\\d{3}`)(?<!999)foo\n```\n\nmatches \"foo\" preceded by three digits that are not \"999\". Notice that each of\nthe assertions is applied independently at the same point in the subject\nstring. First there is a check that the previous three characters are all\ndigits, and then there is a check that the same three characters are not \"999\".\nThis pattern does _not_ match \"foo\" preceded by six characters, the first\nof which are digits and the last three of which are not \"999\". For example, it\ndoesn't match \"123abcfoo\". A pattern to do that is\n\n```text\n(?<=\\d{3}...)(?<!999)foo\n```\n\nThis time the first assertion looks at the preceding six characters, checking\nthat the first three are digits, and then the second assertion checks that the\npreceding three characters are not \"999\".\n\nAssertions can be nested in any combination. For example,\n\n```text\n(?<=(?<!foo)bar)baz\n```\n\nmatches an occurrence of \"baz\" that is preceded by \"bar\" which in turn is not\npreceded by \"foo\", while\n\n```text\n(?<=\\d{3}(?!999)...)foo\n```\n\nis another pattern that matches \"foo\" preceded by three digits and any three\ncharacters that are not \"999\".\n\n[](){: #sect18 }","ref":"re.html#module-assertions"},{"type":"module","title":"Non-Atomic Assertions - re","doc":"Traditional lookaround assertions are atomic.

How does it work? At the start, `^(?x)` anchors the pattern and sets the\n\"x\" option, which causes white space (introduced for readability) to be\nignored. Inside the assertion, the greedy `.*` at first consumes the entire\nstring, but then has to backtrack until the rest of the assertion can match a\nword, which is captured by group 1. In other words, when the assertion first\nsucceeds, it captures the right-most word in the string.\n\nThe current matching point is then reset to the start of the subject, and the\nrest of the pattern match checks for two occurrences of the captured word,\nusing an ungreedy .*? to scan from the left.

There is a full description of\nthe rules that PCRE2 uses in the section entitled\n\"Script Runs\"\nin the\n`pcre2unicode`\ndocumentation.\n\nIf part of a pattern is enclosed between `(*script_run:` or `(*sr:` and a closing\nparenthesis, it fails if the sequence of characters that it matches are not a\nscript run. After a failure, normal backtracking occurs. Script runs can be\nused to detect spoofing attacks using characters that look the same, but are\nfrom different scripts. The string \"paypal.com\" is an infamous example, where\nthe letters could be a mixture of Latin and Cyrillic. This pattern ensures that\nthe matched characters in a sequence of non-spaces that follow white space are\na script run:\n\n```text\n\\s+(*sr:\\S+)\n```\n\nTo be sure that they are all from the Latin script (for example), a lookahead\ncan be used:\n\n```text\n\\s+(?=\\p{Latin})(*sr:\\S+)\n```\n\nThis works as long as the first character is expected to be a character in that\nscript, and not (for example) punctuation, which is allowed with any script.

The two possible forms of conditional group are:\n\n```text\n(?(condition)yes-pattern)\n(?(condition)yes-pattern|no-pattern)\n```\n\nIf the condition is satisfied, the yes-pattern is used; otherwise the\nno-pattern (if present) is used. An absent no-pattern is equivalent to an empty\nstring (it always matches). If there are more than two alternatives in the\ngroup, a compile-time error occurs. Each of the two alternatives may itself\ncontain nested groups of any form, including conditional groups; the\nrestriction to two alternatives applies only at the level of the condition\nitself. This pattern fragment is an example where the alternatives are complex:\n\n```text\n(?(1) (A|B|C) |  (D |  (?(2)E|F) |  E) )\n```\n\nThere are five kinds of condition: references to capture groups, references to\nrecursion, two pseudo-conditions called DEFINE and VERSION, and assertions.\n\n_Checking for a Used Capture Group by Number_\n\n\nIf the text between the parentheses consists of a sequence of digits, the\ncondition is true if a capture group of that number has previously matched. If\nthere is more than one capture group with the same number (see [Duplicate Group Numbers](`m:re#sect12`)),\nthe condition is true if any of them have matched. An alternative notation,\nwhich is a PCRE2 extension, not supported by Perl, is to precede the digits\nwith a plus or minus sign. In this case, the group number is relative rather\nthan absolute. The most recently opened capture group (which could be enclosing\nthis condition) can be referenced by `(?(-1)`, the next most recent by `(?(-2)`,\nand so on. Inside loops it can also make sense to refer to subsequent groups.\nThe next capture group to be opened can be referenced as `(?(+1)`, and so on. The\nvalue zero in any of these forms is not used; it provokes a compile-time error.\n\nConsider the following pattern, which contains non-significant white space to\nmake it more readable (assume the `extended` option) and to divide it into\nthree parts for ease of discussion:\n\n- **( \\( )?** - [^()]+ (?(1) \\) )\n\nThe first part matches an optional opening parenthesis, and if that\ncharacter is present, sets it as the first captured substring. The second part\nmatches one or more characters that are not parentheses. The third part is a\nconditional group that tests whether or not the first capture group\nmatched. If it did, that is, if subject started with an opening parenthesis,\nthe condition is true, and so the yes-pattern is executed and a closing\nparenthesis is required. Otherwise, since no-pattern is not present, the\nconditional group matches nothing. In other words, this pattern matches a\nsequence of non-parentheses, optionally enclosed in parentheses.\n\nIf you were embedding this pattern in a larger one, you could use a relative\nreference:\n\n- **...other stuff... ( \\( )?** -  [^()]+    (?(-1) \\) )  ...\n\nThis makes the fragment independent of the parentheses in the larger pattern.\n\n_Checking for a Used Capture Group by Name_\n\n\nPerl uses the syntax `(?( )...)` or `(?('name')...)` to test for a used\ncapture group by name. For compatibility with earlier versions of PCRE1, which\nhad this facility before Perl, the syntax (?(name)...) is also recognized.\nNote, however, that undelimited names consisting of the letter R followed by\ndigits are ambiguous (see the following section). Rewriting the above example\nto use a named group gives this:\n\n- **(?  \\( )?** - [^()]+ (?( ) \\) )\n\nIf the name used in a condition of this kind is a duplicate, the test is\napplied to all groups of the same name, and is true if any one of them has\nmatched.\n\n_Checking for Pattern Recursion_\n\n\n\"Recursion\" in this sense refers to any subroutine-like call from one part of\nthe pattern to another, whether or not it is actually recursive. See \n[Recursive Patterns](`m:re#sect22`)\nand\n[Groups as Subroutines](`m:re#sect23`) for details of recursion and subroutine calls.\n\nIf a condition is the string (R), and there is no capture group with the name\nR, the condition is true if matching is currently in a recursion or subroutine\ncall to the whole pattern or any capture group. If digits follow the letter R,\nand there is no group with that name, the condition is true if the most recent\ncall is into a group with the given number, which must exist somewhere in the\noverall pattern. This is a contrived example that is equivalent to a+b:\n\n```text\n((?(R1)a+|(?1)b))\n```\n\nHowever, in both cases, if there is a capture group with a matching name, the\ncondition tests for its being set, as described in the section above, instead\nof testing for recursion. For example, creating a group with the name R1 by\nadding `(? )` to the above pattern completely changes its meaning.\n\nIf a name preceded by ampersand follows the letter R, for example:\n\n```text\n(?(R&name)...)\n```\n\nthe condition is true if the most recent recursion is into a group of that name\n(which must exist within the pattern).\n\nThis condition does not check the entire recursion stack. It tests only the\ncurrent level. If the name used in a condition of this kind is a duplicate, the\ntest is applied to all groups of the same name, and is true if any one of\nthem is the most recent recursion.\n\nAt \"top level\", all these recursion test conditions are false.\n\n[](){: #sect20.1}\n_Defining Capture Groups for Use by Reference Only_\n\n\nIf the condition is the string `(DEFINE)`, the condition is always false, even if\nthere is a group with the name DEFINE. In this case, there may be only one\nalternative in the rest of the conditional group. It is always skipped if\ncontrol reaches this point in the pattern; the idea of DEFINE is that it can be\nused to define subroutines that can be referenced from elsewhere. (The use of\nsubroutines\nis described below.) For example, a pattern to match an IPv4 address such as\n\"192.168.23.245\" could be written like this (ignore white space and line\nbreaks):\n\n```text\n(?(DEFINE) (?  2[0-4]\\d |  25[0-5] |  1\\d\\d |  [1-9]?\\d) )\n\\b (?&byte) (\\.(?&byte)){3} \\b\n```\n\nThe first part of the pattern is a DEFINE group inside which another group\nnamed \"byte\" is defined. This matches an individual component of an IPv4\naddress (a number less than 256). When matching takes place, this part of the\npattern is skipped because DEFINE acts like a false condition. The rest of the\npattern uses references to the named group to match the four dot-separated\ncomponents of an IPv4 address, insisting on a word boundary at each end.\n\n_Checking the PCRE2 Version_\n\n\nPrograms that link with a PCRE2 library can check the version by calling\n`pcre2\\_config()` with appropriate arguments. Users of applications that do\nnot have access to the underlying code cannot do this. A special \"condition\"\ncalled VERSION exists to allow such users to discover which version of PCRE2\nthey are dealing with by using this condition to match a string such as\n\"yesno\". VERSION must be followed either by \"=\" or \">=\" and a version number.\nFor example:\n\n```text\n(?(VERSION>=10.4)yes|no)\n```\n\nThis pattern matches \"yes\" if the PCRE2 version is greater or equal to 10.4, or\n\"no\" otherwise. The fractional part of the version number could be ommited.\n\n_Assertion Conditions_\n\n\nIf the condition is not in any of the above formats, it must be a parenthesized\nassertion. This may be a positive or negative lookahead or lookbehind\nassertion. However, it must be a traditional atomic assertion, not one of the\nnon-atomic assertions.\n\nConsider this pattern, again containing non-significant white space, and with\nthe two alternatives on the second line:\n\n```text\n(?(?=[^a-z]*[a-z])\n\\d{2}-[a-z]{3}-\\d{2}  |  \\d{2}-\\d{2}-\\d{2} )\n```\n\nThe condition is a positive lookahead assertion that matches an optional\nsequence of non-letters followed by a letter. In other words, it tests for the\npresence of at least one letter in the subject. If a letter is found, the\nsubject is matched against the first alternative; otherwise it is matched\nagainst the second. This pattern matches strings in one of the two forms\ndd-aaa-dd or dd-dd-dd, where aaa are letters and dd are digits.\n\nWhen an assertion that is a condition contains capture groups, any\ncapturing that occurs in a matching branch is retained afterwards, for both\npositive and negative assertions, because matching always continues after the\nassertion, whether it succeeds or fails. (Compare non-conditional assertions,\nfor which captures are retained only for positive assertions that succeed.)\n\n\n[](){: #sect21}","ref":"re.html#module-conditional-groups"},{"type":"module","title":"Comments - re","doc":"There are two ways of including comments in patterns that are processed by\nPCRE2.

Without the use of recursion, the best that can\nbe done is to use a pattern that matches up to some fixed depth of nesting. It\nis not possible to handle an arbitrary nesting depth.\n\nFor some time, Perl has provided a facility that allows regular expressions to\nrecurse (amongst other things). It does this by interpolating Perl code in the\nexpression at run time, and the code can refer to the expression itself. A Perl\npattern using code interpolation to solve the parentheses problem can be\ncreated like this:\n\n```text\n$re =  qr{\\( (?: (?>[^()]+) |  (?p{$re}) )* \\)}x;\n```\n\nThe `(?p{...})` item interpolates Perl code at run time, and in this case refers\nrecursively to the pattern in which it appears.\n\nObviously, PCRE2 cannot support the interpolation of Perl code. Instead, it\nsupports special syntax for recursion of the entire pattern, and also for\nindividual capture group recursion. After its introduction in PCRE1 and Python,\nthis kind of recursion was subsequently introduced into Perl at release 5.10.\n\nA special item that consists of `(?` followed by a number greater than zero and a\nclosing parenthesis is a recursive subroutine call of the capture group of the\ngiven number, provided that it occurs inside that group. (If not, it is a\nnon-recursive subroutine\ncall, which is described in the next section.) The special item `(?R)` or `(?0)` is\na recursive call of the entire regular expression.\n\nThis PCRE2 pattern solves the nested parentheses problem (assume the\n`extended` option is set so that white space is ignored):\n\n```text\n\\( ( [^()]++ | (?R) )* \\)\n```\n\nFirst it matches an opening parenthesis. Then it matches any number of\nsubstrings which can either be a sequence of non-parentheses, or a recursive\nmatch of the pattern itself (that is, a correctly parenthesized substring).\nFinally there is a closing parenthesis. Note the use of a possessive quantifier\nto avoid backtracking into sequences of non-parentheses.\n\nIf this were part of a larger pattern, you would not want to recurse the entire\npattern, so instead you could use this:\n\n```text\n( \\( ( [^()]++ | (?1) )* \\) )\n```\n\nWe have put the pattern into parentheses, and caused the recursion to refer to\nthem instead of the whole pattern.\n\nIn a larger pattern, keeping track of parenthesis numbers can be tricky. This\nis made easier by the use of relative references. Instead of `(?1)` in the\npattern above you can write `(?-2)` to refer to the second most recently opened\nparentheses preceding the recursion. In other words, a negative number counts\ncapturing parentheses leftwards from the point at which it is encountered.\n\nBe aware however, that if\nduplicate capture group numbers\nare in use, relative references refer to the earliest group with the\nappropriate number. Consider, for example:\n\n```text\n(?|(a)|(b)) (c) (?-2)\n```\n\nThe first two capture groups (a) and (b) are both numbered 1, and group (c)\nis number 2. When the reference `(?-2)` is encountered, the second most recently\nopened parentheses has the number 1, but it is the first such group (the (a)\ngroup) to which the recursion refers. This would be the same if an absolute\nreference `(?1)` was used. In other words, relative references are just a\nshorthand for computing a group number.\n\nIt is also possible to refer to subsequent capture groups, by writing\nreferences such as `(?+2)`. However, these cannot be recursive because the\nreference is not inside the parentheses that are referenced. They are always\nnon-recursive subroutine\ncalls, as described in the next section.\n\nAn alternative approach is to use named parentheses. The Perl syntax for this\nis `(?&name)`; PCRE1's earlier syntax `(?P>name)` is also supported. We could\nrewrite the above example as follows:\n\n```text\n(?  \\( ( [^()]++ | (?&pn) )* \\) )\n```\n\nIf there is more than one group with the same name, the earliest one is\nused.\n\nThe example pattern that we have been looking at contains nested unlimited\nrepeats, and so the use of a possessive quantifier for matching strings of\nnon-parentheses is important when applying the pattern to strings that do not\nmatch. For example, when this pattern is applied to\n\n```text\n(aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa()\n```\n\nit yields \"no match\" quickly. However, if a possessive quantifier is not used,\nthe match runs for a very long time indeed because there are so many different\nways the `+` and `*` repeats can carve up the subject, and all have to be tested\nbefore failure can be reported.\n\nAt the end of a match, the values of capturing parentheses are those from\nthe outermost level. If you want to obtain intermediate values, a callout\nfunction can be used (see below and the\n`pcre2callout`\ndocumentation). If the pattern above is matched against\n\n```text\n(ab(cd)ef)\n```\n\nthe value for the inner capturing parentheses (numbered 2) is \"ef\", which is\nthe last value taken on at the top level. If a capture group is not matched at\nthe top level, its final captured value is unset, even if it was (temporarily)\nset at a deeper level during the matching process.\n\nDo not confuse the `(?R)` item with the condition `(R)`, which tests for recursion.\nConsider this pattern, which matches text in angle brackets, allowing for\narbitrary nesting. Only digits are allowed in nested brackets (that is, when\nrecursing), whereas any characters are permitted at the outer level.\n\n```text\n< (?: (?(R) \\d++  |  [^<>]*+) |  (?R)) *  >\n```\n\nIn this pattern, `(?(R)` is the start of a conditional group, with two different\nalternatives for the recursive and non-recursive cases. The `(?R)` item is the\nactual recursive call.\n\n_Differences in Recursion Processing Between PCRE2 and Perl_\n\n\nSome former differences between PCRE2 and Perl no longer exist.\n\nBefore release 10.30, recursion processing in PCRE2 differed from Perl in that\na recursive subroutine call was always treated as an atomic group. That is,\nonce it had matched some of the subject string, it was never re-entered, even\nif it contained untried alternatives and there was a subsequent matching\nfailure. (Historical note: PCRE implemented recursion before Perl did.)\n\nStarting with release 10.30, recursive subroutine calls are no longer treated\nas atomic. That is, they can be re-entered to try unused alternatives if there\nis a matching failure later in the pattern. This is now compatible with the way\nPerl works. If you want a subroutine call to be atomic, you must explicitly\nenclose it in an atomic group.\n\nSupporting backtracking into recursions simplifies certain types of recursive\npattern. For example, this pattern matches palindromic strings:\n\n```text\n^((.)(?1)\\2|.?)$\n```\n\nThe second branch in the group matches a single central character in the\npalindrome when there are an odd number of characters, or nothing when there\nare an even number of characters, but in order to work it has to be able to try\nthe second case when the rest of the pattern match fails. If you want to match\ntypical palindromic phrases, the pattern has to ignore all non-word characters,\nwhich can be done like this:\n\n```text\n^\\W*+((.)\\W*+(?1)\\W*+\\2|\\W*+.?)\\W*+$\n```\n\nIf run with the `caseless` option, this pattern matches phrases such as \"A\nman, a plan, a canal: Panama!\". Note the use of the possessive quantifier *+ to\navoid backtracking into sequences of non-word characters. Without this, PCRE2\ntakes a great deal longer (ten times or more) to match typical phrases, and\nPerl takes so long that you think it has gone into a loop.\n\nAnother way in which PCRE2 and Perl used to differ in their recursion\nprocessing is in the handling of captured values. Formerly in Perl, when a\ngroup was called recursively or as a subroutine (see [Groups as Subroutines](`m:re#sect23`)), it\nhad no access to any values that were captured outside the recursion, whereas\nin PCRE2 these values can be referenced. Consider this pattern:\n\n```text\n^(.)(\\1|a(?2))\n```\n\nThis pattern matches \"bab\". The first capturing parentheses match \"b\", then in\nthe second group, when the backreference `\\1` fails to match \"b\", the second\nalternative matches \"a\" and then recurses.

The called group may be defined before or after the reference.

They\nare generally of the form `(*VERB)` or `(*VERB:NAME)`. Some verbs take either form,\nand may behave differently depending on whether or not a name argument is\npresent. The names are not required to be unique within the pattern.\n\nBy default, for compatibility with Perl, a name is any sequence of characters\nthat does not include a closing parenthesis. The name is not processed in\nany way, and it is not possible to include a closing parenthesis in the name.\n\nA closing parenthesis can be included in a name either as `\\)` or between `\\Q`\nand `\\E`. In addition to backslash processing, if the `extended` or\nPCRE2_EXTENDED_MORE option is also set, unescaped white space in verb names is\nskipped, and #-comments are recognized, exactly as in the rest of the pattern.\n`extended` and PCRE2_EXTENDED_MORE do not affect verb names.\n\nThe maximum length of a name is 255 in the 8-bit library. If the name is empty, that is, if the closing\nparenthesis immediately follows the colon, the effect is as if the colon were\nnot there. Any number of these verbs may occur in a pattern. Except for\n`(*ACCEPT)`, they may not be quantified.\n\nSince these verbs are specifically related to backtracking, most of them can be\nused only when the pattern is to be matched using the traditional matching\nfunction, because it uses backtracking algorithms. With the exception\nof `(*FAIL)`, which behaves like a failing negative assertion.\n\nThe behaviour of these verbs in repeated groups, assertions, and in\ncapture groups called as subroutines\n(whether or not recursively) is documented below.\n\n_Optimizations that affect backtracking verbs_\n\n\nPCRE2 contains some optimizations that are used to speed up matching by running\nsome checks at the start of each match attempt. For example, it may know the\nminimum length of matching subject, or that a particular character must be\npresent. When one of these optimizations bypasses the running of a match, any\nincluded backtracking verbs will not, of course, be processed. You can suppress\nthe start-of-match optimizations by setting the `no_start_optimize` option\nwhen calling `compile/2` or by starting the pattern with `(*NO_START_OPT)`.\n\nExperiments with Perl suggest that it too has similar optimizations, and like\nPCRE2, turning them off can change the result of a match.\n\n_Verbs that act immediately_\n\nThe following verbs act as soon as they are encountered.\n\n```text\n(*ACCEPT) or (*ACCEPT:NAME)\n```\n\nThis verb causes the match to end successfully, skipping the remainder of the\npattern. However, when it is inside a capture group that is called as a\nsubroutine, only that group is ended successfully. Matching then continues\nat the outer level. If `(*ACCEPT)` in triggered in a positive assertion, the\nassertion succeeds; in a negative assertion, the assertion fails.\n\nIf `(*ACCEPT)` is inside capturing parentheses, the data so far is captured. For\nexample:\n\n```text\nA((?:A|B(*ACCEPT)|C)D)\n```\n\nThis matches \"AB\", \"AAD\", or \"ACD\"; when it matches \"AB\", \"B\" is captured by\nthe outer parentheses.\n\n`(*ACCEPT)` is the only backtracking verb that is allowed to be quantified\nbecause an ungreedy quantification with a minimum of zero acts only when a\nbacktrack happens. Consider, for example,\n\n```text\n(A(*ACCEPT)??B)C\n```\n\nwhere A, B, and C may be complex expressions. After matching \"A\", the matcher\nprocesses \"BC\"; if that fails, causing a backtrack, `(*ACCEPT)` is triggered and\nthe match succeeds. In both cases, all but C is captured. Whereas `(*COMMIT)`\n(see below) means \"fail on backtrack\", a repeated `(*ACCEPT)` of this type means\n\"succeed on backtrack\".\n\n> #### Warning {: .warning }\n> `(*ACCEPT)` should not be used within a script run group, because\n> it causes an immediate exit from the group, bypassing the script run checking.\n\n```text\n(*FAIL) or (*FAIL:NAME)\n```\n\nThis verb causes a matching failure, forcing backtracking to occur. It may be\nabbreviated to `(*F)`. It is equivalent to `(?!)` but easier to read. The Perl\ndocumentation notes that it is probably useful only when combined with `(?{})` or\n`(??{})`. Those are, of course, Perl features that are not present in PCRE2. The\nnearest equivalent is the callout feature, as for example in this pattern:\n\n```text\na+(?C)(*FAIL)\n```\n\nA match with the string \"aaaa\" always fails, but the callout is taken before\neach backtrack happens (in this example, 10 times).\n\n`(*ACCEPT:NAME)` and `(*FAIL:NAME)` behave the same as `(*MARK:NAME)(*ACCEPT)` and\n`(*MARK:NAME)(*FAIL)`, respectively, that is, a `(*MARK)` is recorded just before\nthe verb acts.\n\n_Recording which path was taken_\n\n\nThere is one verb whose main purpose is to track how a match was arrived at,\nthough it also has a secondary use in conjunction with advancing the match\nstarting point (see `(*SKIP)` below).\n\n```text\n(*MARK:NAME) or (*:NAME)\n```\n\nA name is always required with this verb. For all the other backtracking\ncontrol verbs, a NAME argument is optional.\n\nWhen a match succeeds, the name of the last-encountered mark name on the\nmatching path is passed back to the caller as described in the section entitled\n\"Other information about the match\"\nin the\n`pcre2api`\ndocumentation. This applies to all instances of `(*MARK)` and other verbs,\nincluding those inside assertions and atomic groups. However, there are\ndifferences in those cases when `(*MARK)` is used in conjunction with `(*SKIP)` as\ndescribed below.\n\nThe mark name that was last encountered on the matching path is passed back. A\nverb without a NAME argument is ignored for this purpose. Here is an example of\n`pcre2test` output, where the \"mark\" modifier requests the retrieval and\noutputting of `(*MARK)` data:\n\n```text\n    re> /X(*MARK:A)Y|X(*MARK:B)Z/mark\ndata> XY\n   0: XY\nMK: A\nXZ\n   0: XZ\nMK: B\n```\n\nThe `(*MARK)` name is tagged with \"MK:\" in this output, and in this example it\nindicates which of the two alternatives matched. This is a more efficient way\nof obtaining this information than putting each alternative in its own\ncapturing parentheses.\n\nIf a verb with a name is encountered in a positive assertion that is true, the\nname is recorded and passed back if it is the last-encountered. This does not\nhappen for negative assertions or failing positive assertions.\n\nAfter a partial match or a failed match, the last encountered name in the\nentire match process is returned. For example:\n\n```text\n    re> /X(*MARK:A)Y|X(*MARK:B)Z/mark\ndata> XP\nNo match, mark `=`  B\n```\n\nNote that in this unanchored example the mark is retained from the match\nattempt that started at the letter \"X\" in the subject. Subsequent match\nattempts starting at \"P\" and then with an empty string do not get as far as the\n`(*MARK)` item, but nevertheless do not reset it.\n\nIf you are interested in `(*MARK)` values after failed matches, you should\nprobably either set the `no_start_optimize` option\nto ensure that the match is always attempted.\n\n_Verbs that act after backtracking_\n\n\nThe following verbs do nothing when they are encountered. Matching continues\nwith what follows, but if there is a subsequent match failure, causing a\nbacktrack to the verb, a failure is forced. That is, backtracking cannot pass\nto the left of the verb. However, when one of these verbs appears inside an\natomic group or in an atomic lookaround assertion that is true, its effect is\nconfined to that group, because once the group has been matched, there is never\nany backtracking into it. Backtracking from beyond an atomic assertion or group\nignores the entire group, and seeks a preceding backtracking point.\n\nThese verbs differ in exactly what kind of failure occurs when backtracking\nreaches them. The behaviour described below is what happens when the verb is\nnot in a subroutine or an assertion. Subsequent sections cover these special\ncases.\n\n```text\n(*COMMIT) or (*COMMIT:NAME)\n```\n\nThis verb causes the whole match to fail outright if there is a later matching\nfailure that causes backtracking to reach it. Even if the pattern is\nunanchored, no further attempts to find a match by advancing the starting point\ntake place. If `(*COMMIT)` is the only backtracking verb that is encountered,\nonce it has been passed `run/3` is committed to finding a match at\nthe current starting point, or not at all. For example:\n\n```text\na+(*COMMIT)b\n```\n\nThis matches \"xxaab\" but not \"aacaab\". It can be thought of as a kind of\ndynamic anchor, or \"I've started, so I must finish.\"\n\nThe behaviour of `(*COMMIT:NAME)` is not the same as `(*MARK:NAME)(*COMMIT)`. It is\nlike `(*MARK:NAME)` in that the name is remembered for passing back to the\ncaller. However, `(*SKIP:NAME)` searches only for names that are set with\n`(*MARK)`, ignoring those set by any of the other backtracking verbs.\n\nIf there is more than one backtracking verb in a pattern, a different one that\nfollows `(*COMMIT)` may be triggered first, so merely passing `(*COMMIT)` during a\nmatch does not always guarantee that a match must be at this starting point.\n\nNote that `(*COMMIT)` at the start of a pattern is not the same as an anchor,\nunless PCRE2's start-of-match optimizations are turned off, as shown in this\noutput from `pcre2test`:\n\n```text\n    re> /(*COMMIT)abc/\ndata> xyzabc\n   0: abc\ndata>\nre> /(*COMMIT)abc/no_start_optimize\ndata> xyzabc\nNo match\n```\n\nFor the first pattern, PCRE2 knows that any match must start with \"a\", so the\noptimization skips along the subject to \"a\" before applying the pattern to the\nfirst set of data. The match attempt then succeeds. The second pattern disables\nthe optimization that skips along to the first character. The pattern is now\napplied starting at \"x\", and so the `(*COMMIT)` causes the match to fail without\ntrying any other starting points.\n\n```text\n(*PRUNE) or (*PRUNE:NAME)\n```\n\nThis verb causes the match to fail at the current starting position in the\nsubject if there is a later matching failure that causes backtracking to reach\nit. If the pattern is unanchored, the normal \"bumpalong\" advance to the next\nstarting character then happens. Backtracking can occur as usual to the left of\n`(*PRUNE)`, before it is reached, or when matching to the right of `(*PRUNE)`, but\nif there is no match to the right, backtracking cannot cross `(*PRUNE)`. In\nsimple cases, the use of `(*PRUNE)` is just an alternative to an atomic group or\npossessive quantifier, but there are some uses of `(*PRUNE)` that cannot be\nexpressed in any other way. In an anchored pattern `(*PRUNE)` has the same effect\nas `(*COMMIT)`.\n\nThe behaviour of `(*PRUNE:NAME)` is not the same as `(*MARK:NAME)(*PRUNE)`. It is\nlike `(*MARK:NAME)` in that the name is remembered for passing back to the\ncaller. However, `(*SKIP:NAME)` searches only for names set with `(*MARK)`,\nignoring those set by other backtracking verbs.\n\n```text\n(*SKIP)\n```\n\nThis verb, when given without a name, is like `(*PRUNE)`, except that if the\npattern is unanchored, the \"bumpalong\" advance is not to the next character,\nbut to the position in the subject where `(*SKIP)` was encountered. `(*SKIP)`\nsignifies that whatever text was matched leading up to it cannot be part of a\nsuccessful match if there is a later mismatch. Consider:\n\n```text\na+(*SKIP)b\n```\n\nIf the subject is \"aaaac...\", after the first match attempt fails (starting at\nthe first character in the string), the starting point skips on to start the\nnext attempt at \"c\". Note that a possessive quantifier does not have the same\neffect as this example; although it would suppress backtracking during the\nfirst match attempt, the second attempt would start at the second character\ninstead of skipping on to \"c\".\n\nIf `(*SKIP)` is used to specify a new starting position that is the same as the\nstarting position of the current match, or (by being inside a lookbehind)\nearlier, the position specified by `(*SKIP)` is ignored, and instead the normal\n\"bumpalong\" occurs.\n\n```text\n(*SKIP:NAME)\n```\n\nWhen `(*SKIP)` has an associated name, its behaviour is modified. When such a\n`(*SKIP)` is triggered, the previous path through the pattern is searched for the\nmost recent `(*MARK)` that has the same name. If one is found, the \"bumpalong\"\nadvance is to the subject position that corresponds to that `(*MARK)` instead of\nto where `(*SKIP)` was encountered. If no `(*MARK)` with a matching name is found,\nthe `(*SKIP)` is ignored.\n\nThe search for a `(*MARK)` name uses the normal backtracking mechanism, which\nmeans that it does not see `(*MARK)` settings that are inside atomic groups or\nassertions, because they are never re-entered by backtracking. Compare the\nfollowing `pcre2test` examples:\n\n```text\n    re> /a(?>(*MARK:X))(*SKIP:X)(*F)|(.)/\ndata: abc\n   0: a\n   1: a\ndata:\n    re> /a(?:(*MARK:X))(*SKIP:X)(*F)|(.)/\ndata: abc\n   0: b\n   1: b\n```\n\nIn the first example, the `(*MARK)` setting is in an atomic group, so it is not\nseen when `(*SKIP:X)` triggers, causing the `(*SKIP)` to be ignored. This allows\nthe second branch of the pattern to be tried at the first character position.\nIn the second example, the `(*MARK)` setting is not in an atomic group. This\nallows `(*SKIP:X)` to find the `(*MARK)` when it backtracks, and this causes a new\nmatching attempt to start at the second character. This time, the `(*MARK)` is\nnever seen because \"a\" does not match \"b\", so the matcher immediately jumps to\nthe second branch of the pattern.\n\nNote that `(*SKIP:NAME)` searches only for names set by `(*MARK:NAME)`. It ignores\nnames that are set by other backtracking verbs.\n\n```text\n(*THEN) or (*THEN:NAME)\n```\n\nThis verb causes a skip to the next innermost alternative when backtracking\nreaches it. That is, it cancels any further backtracking within the current\nalternative. Its name comes from the observation that it can be used for a\npattern-based if-then-else block:\n\n```text\n( COND1 (*THEN) FOO |  COND2 (*THEN) BAR |  COND3 (*THEN) BAZ )  ...\n```\n\nIf the COND1 pattern matches, FOO is tried (and possibly further items after\nthe end of the group if FOO succeeds); on failure, the matcher skips to the\nsecond alternative and tries COND2, without backtracking into COND1. If that\nsucceeds and BAR fails, COND3 is tried. If subsequently BAZ fails, there are no\nmore alternatives, so there is a backtrack to whatever came before the entire\ngroup. If `(*THEN)` is not inside an alternation, it acts like `(*PRUNE)`.\n\nThe behaviour of `(*THEN:NAME)` is not the same as `(*MARK:NAME)(*THEN)`. It is\nlike `(*MARK:NAME)` in that the name is remembered for passing back to the\ncaller. However, `(*SKIP:NAME)` searches only for names set with `(*MARK)`,\nignoring those set by other backtracking verbs.\n\nA group that does not contain a `|`  character is just a part of the enclosing\nalternative; it is not a nested alternation with only one alternative. The\neffect of `(*THEN)` extends beyond such a group to the enclosing alternative.\nConsider this pattern, where A, B, etc. are complex pattern fragments that do\nnot contain any `|`  characters at this level:\n\n```text\nA (B(*THEN)C) |  D\n```\n\nIf A and B are matched, but there is a failure in C, matching does not\nbacktrack into A; instead it moves to the next alternative, that is, D.\nHowever, if the group containing `(*THEN)` is given an alternative, it\nbehaves differently:\n\n```text\nA (B(*THEN)C |  (*FAIL)) |  D\n```\n\nThe effect of `(*THEN)` is now confined to the inner group. After a failure in C,\nmatching moves to `(*FAIL)`, which causes the whole group to fail because there\nare no more alternatives to try. In this case, matching does backtrack into A.\n\nNote that a conditional group is not considered as having two alternatives,\nbecause only one is ever used. In other words, the `|`  character in a conditional\ngroup has a different meaning. Ignoring white space, consider:\n\n```text\n^.*? (?(?=a) a |  b(*THEN)c )\n```\n\nIf the subject is \"ba\", this pattern does not match. Because `.*?` is ungreedy,\nit initially matches zero characters. The condition (?=a) then fails, the\ncharacter \"b\" is matched, but \"c\" is not. At this point, matching does not\nbacktrack to .*? as might perhaps be expected from the presence of the |\ncharacter. The conditional group is part of the single alternative that\ncomprises the whole pattern, and so the match fails. (If there was a backtrack\ninto `.*?`, allowing it to match \"b\", the match would succeed.)\n\nThe verbs just described provide four different \"strengths\" of control when\nsubsequent matching fails. `(*THEN)` is the weakest, carrying on the match at the\nnext alternative. `(*PRUNE)` comes next, failing the match at the current\nstarting position, but allowing an advance to the next character (for an\nunanchored pattern). `(*SKIP)` is similar, except that the advance may be more\nthan one character. `(*COMMIT)` is the strongest, causing the entire match to\nfail.\n\n_More than one backtracking verb_\n\n\nIf more than one backtracking verb is present in a pattern, the one that is\nbacktracked onto first acts. For example, consider this pattern, where A, B,\netc. are complex pattern fragments:\n\n```text\n(A(*COMMIT)B(*THEN)C|ABD)\n```\n\nIf A matches but B fails, the backtrack to `(*COMMIT)` causes the entire match to\nfail. However, if A and B match, but C fails, the backtrack to `(*THEN)` causes\nthe next alternative (ABD) to be tried. This behaviour is consistent, but is\nnot always the same as Perl's. It means that if two or more backtracking verbs\nappear in succession, all but the last of them has no effect. Consider this\nexample:\n\n```text\n...(*COMMIT)(*PRUNE)...\n```\n\nIf there is a matching failure to the right, backtracking onto `(*PRUNE)` causes\nit to be triggered, and its action is taken. There can never be a backtrack\nonto `(*COMMIT)`.\n\n_Backtracking verbs in repeated groups_\n\n\nPCRE2 sometimes differs from Perl in its handling of backtracking verbs in\nrepeated groups. For example, consider:\n\n```text\n/(a(*COMMIT)b)+ac/\n```\n\nIf the subject is \"abac\", Perl matches unless its optimizations are disabled,\nbut PCRE2 always fails because the `(*COMMIT)` in the second repeat of the group\nacts.\n\n_Backtracking verbs in assertions_\n\n\n`(*FAIL)` in any assertion has its normal effect: it forces an immediate\nbacktrack. The behaviour of the other backtracking verbs depends on whether or\nnot the assertion is standalone or acting as the condition in a conditional\ngroup.\n\n`(*ACCEPT)` in a standalone positive assertion causes the assertion to succeed\nwithout any further processing; captured strings and a mark name (if set) are\nretained. In a standalone negative assertion, `(*ACCEPT)` causes the assertion to\nfail without any further processing; captured substrings and any mark name are\ndiscarded.\n\nIf the assertion is a condition, `(*ACCEPT)` causes the condition to be true for\na positive assertion and false for a negative one; captured substrings are\nretained in both cases.\n\nThe remaining verbs act only when a later failure causes a backtrack to\nreach them. This means that, for the Perl-compatible assertions, their effect\nis confined to the assertion, because Perl lookaround assertions are atomic. A\nbacktrack that occurs after such an assertion is complete does not jump back\ninto the assertion. Note in particular that a `(*MARK)` name that is set in an\nassertion is not \"seen\" by an instance of `(*SKIP:NAME)` later in the pattern.\n\nPCRE2 now supports non-atomic positive assertions and also \"scan substring\"\nassertions, as described in the sections entitled\n\"Non-atomic assertions\"\nand\n\"Scan substring assertions\"\nabove. These assertions must be standalone (not used as conditions). They are\nnot Perl-compatible. For these assertions, a later backtrack does jump back\ninto the assertion, and therefore verbs such as `(*COMMIT)` can be triggered by\nbacktracks from later in the pattern.\n\nThe effect of `(*THEN)` is not allowed to escape beyond an assertion. If there\nare no more branches to try, `(*THEN)` causes a positive assertion to be false,\nand a negative assertion to be true. This behaviour differs from Perl when the\nassertion has only one branch.\n\nThe other backtracking verbs are not treated specially if they appear in a\nstandalone positive assertion. In a conditional positive assertion,\nbacktracking (from within the assertion) into `(*COMMIT)`, `(*SKIP)`, or `(*PRUNE)`\ncauses the condition to be false. However, for both standalone and conditional\nnegative assertions, backtracking into `(*COMMIT)`, `(*SKIP)`, or `(*PRUNE)` causes\nthe assertion to be true, without considering any further alternative branches.\n\n[](){: #sect26.1}\n_Backtracking verbs in subroutines_\n\n\nThese behaviours occur whether or not the group is called recursively.\n\n`(*ACCEPT)` in a group called as a subroutine causes the subroutine match to\nsucceed without any further processing. Matching then continues after the\nsubroutine call. Perl documents this behaviour. Perl's treatment of the other\nverbs in subroutines is different in some cases.\n\n`(*FAIL)` in a group called as a subroutine has its normal effect: it forces\nan immediate backtrack.\n\n`(*COMMIT)`, `(*SKIP)`, and `(*PRUNE)` cause the subroutine match to fail when\ntriggered by being backtracked to in a group called as a subroutine. There is\nthen a backtrack at the outer level.\n\n`(*THEN)`, when triggered, skips to the next alternative in the innermost\nenclosing group that has alternatives (its normal behaviour). However, if there\nis no such group within the subroutine's group, the subroutine match fails and\nthere is a backtrack at the outer level.","ref":"re.html#module-backtracking-control"},{"type":"type","title":"re.capture/0","doc":"","ref":"re.html#t:capture/0"},{"type":"function","title":"re.compile/1","doc":"The same as [`compile(Regexp,[])`](`compile/2`)","ref":"re.html#compile/1"},{"type":"function","title":"re.compile/2","doc":"Compiles a regular expression, with the syntax described below, into an internal\nformat to be used later as a parameter to `run/2` and `run/3`.\n\nCompiling the regular expression before matching is useful if the same\nexpression is to be used in matching against multiple subjects during the\nlifetime of the program.

Without it, a dot does not match when the current position\n  is at a newline. This option is equivalent to Perl option `/s` and it can be\n  changed within a pattern by a `(?s)` option setting. A negative class, such as\n  `[^a]`, always matches newline characters, independent of the setting of this\n  option.\n\n- **`extended`** - If this option is set, most white space characters in the\n  pattern are totally ignored except when escaped or inside a character class.\n  However, white space is not allowed within sequences such as `(?>` that\n  introduce various parenthesized subpatterns, nor within a numerical quantifier\n  such as `{1,3}`. However, ignorable white space is permitted between an item\n  and a following quantifier and between a quantifier and a following + that\n  indicates possessiveness.\n\n  White space did not used to include the VT character (code 11), because Perl\n  did not treat this character as white space. However, Perl changed at release\n  5.18, so PCRE followed at release 8.34, and VT is now treated as white space.\n\n  This also causes characters between an unescaped # outside a character class\n  and the next newline, inclusive, to be ignored. This is equivalent to Perl's\n  `/x` option, and it can be changed within a pattern by a `(?x)` option\n  setting.\n\n  With this option, comments inside complicated patterns can be included.\n  However, notice that this applies only to data characters. Whitespace\n  characters can never appear within special character sequences in a pattern,\n  for example within sequence `(?(` that introduces a conditional subpattern.\n\n- **`firstline`** - An unanchored pattern is required to match before or at the\n  first newline in the subject string, although the matched text can continue\n  over the newline.\n\n- **`multiline`** - By default, PCRE treats the subject string as consisting of\n  a single line of characters (even if it contains newlines). The \"start of\n  line\" metacharacter (`^`) matches only at the start of the string, while the\n  \"end of line\" metacharacter (`$`) matches only at the end of the string, or\n  before a terminating newline (unless option `dollar_endonly` is specified).\n  This is the same as in Perl.\n\n  When this option is specified, the \"start of line\" and \"end of line\"\n  constructs match immediately following or immediately before internal newlines\n  in the subject string, respectively, as well as at the very start and end.\n  This is equivalent to Perl option `/m` and can be changed within a pattern by\n  a `(?m)` option setting. If there are no newlines in a subject string, or no\n  occurrences of `^` or `$` in a pattern, setting `multiline` has no effect.\n\n- **`no_auto_capture`** - Disables the use of numbered capturing parentheses in\n  the pattern. Any opening parenthesis that is not followed by `?` behaves as if\n  it is followed by `?:`. Named parentheses can still be used for capturing (and\n  they acquire numbers in the usual way). There is no equivalent option in Perl.\n\n- **`dupnames`** - Names used to identify capturing subpatterns need not be\n  unique. This can be helpful for certain types of pattern when it is known that\n  only one instance of the named subpattern can ever be matched. More details of\n  named subpatterns are provided below.\n\n- **`ungreedy`** - Inverts the \"greediness\" of the quantifiers so that they are\n  not greedy by default, but become greedy if followed by \"?\". It is not\n  compatible with Perl. It can also be set by a `(?U)` option setting within the\n  pattern.\n\n- **`{newline, NLSpec}`** - Overrides the default definition of a newline in the\n  subject string, which is LF (ASCII 10) in Erlang.\n\n  - **`cr`** - Newline is indicated by a single character `cr` (ASCII 13).\n\n  - **`lf`** - Newline is indicated by a single character LF (ASCII 10), the\n    default.\n\n  - **`nul`** - Newline is indicated by a single character NUL (ASCII 0).\n\n  - **`crlf`** - Newline is indicated by the two-character CRLF (ASCII 13\n    followed by ASCII 10) sequence.\n\n  - **`anycrlf`** - Any of the three preceding sequences is to be recognized.\n\n  - **`any`** - Any of the newline sequences above, and the Unicode sequences VT\n    (vertical tab, U+000B), FF (formfeed, U+000C), NEL (next line, U+0085), LS\n    (line separator, U+2028), and PS (paragraph separator, U+2029).\n\n- **`bsr_anycrlf`** - Specifies specifically that \\\\R is to match only the CR,\n  LF, or CRLF sequences, not the Unicode-specific newline characters.\n\n- **`bsr_unicode`** - Specifies specifically that \\\\R is to match all the\n  Unicode newline characters (including CRLF, and so on, the default).\n\n- **`no_start_optimize`** - Disables optimization that can malfunction if\n  \"Special start-of-pattern items\" are present in the regular expression. A\n  typical example would be when matching \"DEFABC\" against \"(*COMMIT)ABC\", where\n  the start optimization of PCRE would skip the subject up to \"A\" and never\n  realize that the (*COMMIT) instruction is to have made the matching fail. This\n  option is only relevant if you use \"start-of-pattern items\", as discussed in\n  section [PCRE Regular Expression Details](`m:re#module-pcre2-regular-expression-details`).\n\n- **`ucp`** - Specifies that Unicode character properties are to be used when\n  resolving \\\\B, \\\\b, \\\\D, \\\\d, \\\\S, \\\\s, \\\\W and \\\\w. Without this flag, only\n  ISO Latin-1 properties are used. Using Unicode properties hurts performance,\n  but is semantically correct when working with Unicode characters beyond the\n  ISO Latin-1 range.\n\n- **`never_utf`** - Specifies that the (*UTF) and/or (*UTF8) \"start-of-pattern\n  items\" are forbidden. This flag cannot be combined with option `unicode`.\n  Useful if ISO Latin-1 patterns from an external source are to be compiled.\n\n- [](){: #EXPORT_OPT }**`export`** - Returns the compiled regular expression in\n  a format [`exported()`](`t:exported/0`) that can be imported into any node\n  instance. Normally, a compiled regex can only be executed by the node instance\n  that compiled it. With option `export` the returned term can be communicated\n  (in any way) to any node. The receiving node must import it by calling\n  `import/1` to get a compiled regular expression executable on that local node.\n\n  Option `export` and function `import/1` are supported since OTP 28.1.","ref":"re.html#compile/2"},{"type":"type","title":"re.compile_option/0","doc":"","ref":"re.html#t:compile_option/0"},{"type":"type","title":"re.compile_options/0","doc":"","ref":"re.html#t:compile_options/0"},{"type":"type","title":"re.exported/0","doc":"Opaque data type containing an [exported](#EXPORT_OPT) compiled regular\nexpression.\n\nType `exported()` is guaranteed to be a tuple having the atom\n`re_exported_pattern` as its first element to allow for matching in guards.

The options are described in\ndetail below.\n\nIf the capture options describe that no substring capturing is to be done\n(`{capture, none}`), the function returns the single atom `match` upon\nsuccessful matching, otherwise the tuple `{match, ValueList}`. Disabling\ncapturing can be done either by specifying `none` or an empty list as\n`ValueSpec`.\n\nOption `report_errors` adds the possibility that an error tuple is returned. The\ntuple either indicates a matching error (`match_limit` or\n`match_limit_recursion`), or a compilation error, where the error tuple has the\nformat `{error, {compile, CompileErr}}`. Notice that if option `report_errors`\nis not specified, the function never returns error tuples, but reports\ncompilation errors as a `badarg` exception and failed matches because of\nexceeded match limits simply as `nomatch`.\n\nThe following options are relevant for execution:\n\n- **`anchored`** - Limits [`run/3`](`run/3`) to matching at the first matching\n  position. If a pattern was compiled with `anchored`, or turned out to be\n  anchored by virtue of its contents, it cannot be made unanchored at matching\n  time, hence there is no `unanchored` option.\n\n- **`global`** - Implements global (repetitive) search (flag `g` in Perl). Each\n  match is returned as a separate `t:list/0` containing the specific match and\n  any matching subexpressions (or as specified by option `capture`. The\n  `Captured` part of the return value is hence a `t:list/0` of `t:list/0`s when\n  this option is specified.\n\n  The interaction of option `global` with a regular expression that matches an\n  empty string surprises some users. When option `global` is specified,\n  [`run/3`](`run/3`) handles empty matches in the same way as Perl: a\n  zero-length match at any point is also retried with options\n  `[anchored, notempty_atstart]`. If that search gives a result of length > 0,\n  the result is included. Example:\n\n  ```erlang\n  re:run(\"cat\",\"(|at)\",[global]).\n  ```\n\n  The following matchings are performed:\n\n  - **At offset `0`** - The regular expression `(|at)` first match at the\n    initial position of string `cat`, giving the result set `[{0,0},{0,0}]` (the\n    second `{0,0}` is because of the subexpression marked by the parentheses).\n    As the length of the match is 0, we do not advance to the next position yet.\n\n  - **At offset `0` with `[anchored, notempty_atstart]`** - The search is\n    retried with options `[anchored, notempty_atstart]` at the same position,\n    which does not give any interesting result of longer length, so the search\n    position is advanced to the next character (`a`).\n\n  - **At offset `1`** - The search results in `[{1,0},{1,0}]`, so this search is\n    also repeated with the extra options.\n\n  - **At offset `1` with `[anchored, notempty_atstart]`** - Alternative `ab` is\n    found and the result is \\[\\{1,2\\},\\{1,2\\}]. The result is added to the list\n    of results and the position in the search string is advanced two steps.\n\n  - **At offset `3`** - The search once again matches the empty string, giving\n    `[{3,0},{3,0}]`.\n\n  - **At offset `1` with `[anchored, notempty_atstart]`** - This gives no result\n    of length > 0 and we are at the last position, so the global search is\n    complete.\n\n  The result of the call is:\n\n  ```erlang\n  {match,[[{0,0},{0,0}],[{1,0},{1,0}],[{1,2},{1,2}],[{3,0},{3,0}]]}\n  ```\n\n- **`notempty`** - An empty string is not considered to be a valid match if this\n  option is specified. If alternatives in the pattern exist, they are tried. If\n  all the alternatives match the empty string, the entire match fails.\n\n  _Example:_\n\n  If the following pattern is applied to a string not beginning with \"a\" or \"b\",\n  it would normally match the empty string at the start of the subject:\n\n  ```text\n  a?b?\n  ```\n\n  With option `notempty`, this match is invalid, so [`run/3`](`run/3`) searches\n  further into the string for occurrences of \"a\" or \"b\".\n\n- **`notempty_atstart`** - Like `notempty`, except that an empty string match\n  that is not at the start of the subject is permitted. If the pattern is\n  anchored, such a match can occur only if the pattern contains \\\\K.\n\n  Perl has no direct equivalent of `notempty` or `notempty_atstart`, but it does\n  make a special case of a pattern match of the empty string within its split()\n  function, and when using modifier `/g`. The Perl behavior can be emulated\n  after matching a null string by first trying the match again at the same\n  offset with `notempty_atstart` and `anchored`, and then, if that fails, by\n  advancing the starting offset (see below) and trying an ordinary match again.\n\n- **`notbol`** - Specifies that the first character of the subject string is not\n  the beginning of a line, so the circumflex metacharacter is not to match\n  before it. Setting this without `multiline` (at compile time) causes\n  circumflex never to match. This option only affects the behavior of the\n  circumflex metacharacter. It does not affect \\\\A.\n\n- **`noteol`** - Specifies that the end of the subject string is not the end of\n  a line, so the dollar metacharacter is not to match it nor (except in\n  multiline mode) a newline immediately before it. Setting this without\n  `multiline` (at compile time) causes dollar never to match. This option\n  affects only the behavior of the dollar metacharacter. It does not affect \\\\Z\n  or \\\\z.\n\n- **`report_errors`** - Gives better control of the error handling in\n  [`run/3`](`run/3`). When specified, compilation errors (if the regular\n  expression is not already compiled) and runtime errors are explicitly returned\n  as an error tuple.\n\n  The following are the possible runtime errors:\n\n  - **`match_limit`** - The PCRE library sets a limit on how many times the\n    internal match function can be called. Defaults to 10,000,000 in the library\n    compiled for Erlang. If `{error, match_limit}` is returned, the execution of\n    the regular expression has reached this limit. This is normally to be\n    regarded as a `nomatch`, which is the default return value when this occurs,\n    but by specifying `report_errors`, you are informed when the match fails\n    because of too many internal calls.\n\n  - **`match_limit_recursion`** - This error is very similar to `match_limit`,\n    but occurs when the internal match function of PCRE is \"recursively\" called\n    more times than the `match_limit_recursion` limit, which defaults to\n    10,000,000 as well. Notice that as long as the `match_limit` and\n    `match_limit_default` values are kept at the default values, the\n    `match_limit_recursion` error cannot occur, as the `match_limit` error\n    occurs before that (each recursive call is also a call, but not conversely).\n    Both limits can however be changed, either by setting limits directly in the\n    regular expression string (see section\n    [PCRE Regular Expression Details](`m:re#module-pcre2-regular-expression-details`)) or by\n    specifying options to [`run/3`](`run/3`).\n\n  It is important to understand that what is referred to as \"recursion\" when\n  limiting matches is not recursion on the C stack of the Erlang machine or on\n  the Erlang process stack. The PCRE version compiled into the Erlang VM uses\n  machine \"heap\" memory to store values that must be kept over recursion in\n  regular expression matches.\n\n- **`{match_limit, integer() >= 0}`** - Limits the execution time of a match in\n  an implementation-specific way. It is described as follows by the PCRE\n  documentation:\n\n  > The match_limit field provides a means of preventing PCRE from using\n  > up a vast amount of resources when running patterns that are not going\n  > to match, but which have a very large number of possibilities in their\n  > search trees. The classic example is a pattern that uses nested\n  > unlimited repeats.\n  >\n  > Internally, pcre_exec() uses a function called match(), which it calls\n  > repeatedly (sometimes recursively). The limit set by match_limit is\n  > imposed on the number of times this function is called during a match,\n  > which has the effect of limiting the amount of backtracking that can\n  > take place. For patterns that are not anchored, the count restarts\n  > from zero for each position in the subject string.\n\n  This means that runaway regular expression matches can fail faster if the\n  limit is lowered using this option. The default value 10,000,000 is compiled\n  into the Erlang VM.\n\n  > #### Note {: .info }\n  >\n  > This option does in no way affect the execution of the Erlang VM in terms of\n  > \"long running BIFs\". [`run/3`](`run/3`) always gives control back to the\n  > scheduler of Erlang processes at intervals that ensures the real-time\n  > properties of the Erlang system.\n\n- **`{match_limit_recursion, integer() >= 0}`** - Limits the execution time and\n  memory consumption of a match in an implementation-specific way, very similar\n  to `match_limit`. It is described as follows by the PCRE documentation:\n\n  > The match_limit_recursion field is similar to match_limit, but instead\n  > of limiting the total number of times that match() is called, it\n  > limits the depth of recursion. The recursion depth is a smaller number\n  > than the total number of calls, because not all calls to match() are\n  > recursive. This limit is of use only if it is set smaller than\n  > match_limit.\n  >\n  > Limiting the recursion depth limits the amount of machine stack that\n  > can be used, or, when PCRE has been compiled to use memory on the heap\n  > instead of the stack, the amount of heap memory that can be used.\n\n  The Erlang VM uses a PCRE library where heap memory is used when regular\n  expression match recursion occurs. This therefore limits the use of machine\n  heap, not C stack.\n\n  Specifying a lower value can result in matches with deep recursion failing,\n  when they should have matched:\n\n  ```erlang\n  1> re:run(\"aaaaaaaaaaaaaz\",\"(a+)*z\").\n  {match,[{0,14},{0,13}]}\n  2> re:run(\"aaaaaaaaaaaaaz\",\"(a+)*z\",[{match_limit_recursion,5}]).\n  nomatch\n  3> re:run(\"aaaaaaaaaaaaaz\",\"(a+)*z\",[{match_limit_recursion,5},report_errors]).\n  {error,match_limit_recursion}\n  ```\n\n  This option and option `match_limit` are only to be used in rare cases.\n  Understanding of the PCRE library internals is recommended before tampering\n  with these limits.\n\n- **`{offset, integer() >= 0}`** - Start matching at the offset (position)\n  specified in the subject string. The offset is zero-based, so that the default\n  is `{offset,0}` (all of the subject string).\n\n- **`{capture, ValueSpec}`/`{capture, ValueSpec, Type}`** - Specifies which\n  captured substrings are returned and in what format. By default,\n  [`run/3`](`run/3`) captures all of the matching part of the substring and all\n  capturing subpatterns (all of the pattern is automatically captured). The\n  default return type is (zero-based) indexes of the captured parts of the\n  string, specified as `{Offset,Length}` pairs (the `index` `Type` of\n  capturing).\n\n  As an example of the default behavior, the following call returns, as first\n  and only captured string, the matching part of the subject (\"abcd\" in the\n  middle) as an index pair `{3,4}`, where character positions are zero-based,\n  just as in offsets:\n\n  ```erlang\n  re:run(\"ABCabcdABC\",\"abcd\",[]).\n  ```\n\n  The return value of this call is:\n\n  ```erlang\n  {match,[{3,4}]}\n  ```\n\n  Another (and quite common) case is where the regular expression matches all of\n  the subject:\n\n  ```erlang\n  re:run(\"ABCabcdABC\",\".*abcd.*\",[]).\n  ```\n\n  Here the return value correspondingly points out all of the string, beginning\n  at index 0, and it is 10 characters long:\n\n  ```erlang\n  {match,[{0,10}]}\n  ```\n\n  If the regular expression contains capturing subpatterns, like in:\n\n  ```erlang\n  re:run(\"ABCabcdABC\",\".*(abcd).*\",[]).\n  ```\n\n  all of the matched subject is captured, as well as the captured substrings:\n\n  ```erlang\n  {match,[{0,10},{3,4}]}\n  ```\n\n  The complete matching pattern always gives the first return value in the list\n  and the remaining subpatterns are added in the order they occurred in the\n  regular expression.\n\n  The capture tuple is built up as follows:\n\n  - **`ValueSpec`** - Specifies which captured (sub)patterns are to be returned.\n    `ValueSpec` can either be an atom describing a predefined set of return\n    values, or a list containing the indexes or the names of specific\n    subpatterns to return.\n\n    The following are the predefined sets of subpatterns:\n\n    - **`all`** - All captured subpatterns including the complete matching\n      string. This is the default.\n\n    - **`all_names`** - All _named_ subpatterns in the regular expression, as if\n      a `t:list/0` of all the names _in alphabetical order_ was specified. The\n      list of all names can also be retrieved with `inspect/2`.\n\n    - **`first`** - Only the first captured subpattern, which is always the\n      complete matching part of the subject. All explicitly captured subpatterns\n      are discarded.\n\n    - **`all_but_first`** - All but the first matching subpattern, that is, all\n      explicitly captured subpatterns, but not the complete matching part of the\n      subject string. This is useful if the regular expression as a whole\n      matches a large part of the subject, but the part you are interested in is\n      in an explicitly captured subpattern. If the return type is `list` or\n      `binary`, not returning subpatterns you are not interested in is a good\n      way to optimize.\n\n    - **`none`** - Returns no matching subpatterns, gives the single atom\n      `match` as the return value of the function when matching successfully\n      instead of the `{match, list()}` return. Specifying an empty list gives\n      the same behavior.\n\n    The value list is a list of indexes for the subpatterns to return, where\n    index 0 is for all of the pattern, and 1 is for the first explicit capturing\n    subpattern in the regular expression, and so on. When using named captured\n    subpatterns (see below) in the regular expression, one can use `t:atom/0`s\n    or `t:string/0`s to specify the subpatterns to be returned. For example,\n    consider the regular expression:\n\n    ```text\n    \".*(abcd).*\"\n    ```\n\n    matched against string \"ABCabcdABC\", capturing only the \"abcd\" part (the\n    first explicit subpattern):\n\n    ```erlang\n    re:run(\"ABCabcdABC\",\".*(abcd).*\",[{capture,[1]}]).\n    ```\n\n    The call gives the following result, as the first explicitly captured\n    subpattern is \"(abcd)\", matching \"abcd\" in the subject, at (zero-based)\n    position 3, of length 4:\n\n    ```erlang\n    {match,[{3,4}]}\n    ```\n\n    Consider the same regular expression, but with the subpattern explicitly\n    named 'FOO':\n\n    ```text\n    \".*(? abcd).*\"\n    ```\n\n    With this expression, we could still give the index of the subpattern with\n    the following call:\n\n    ```erlang\n    re:run(\"ABCabcdABC\",\".*(? abcd).*\",[{capture,[1]}]).\n    ```\n\n    giving the same result as before. But, as the subpattern is named, we can\n    also specify its name in the value list:\n\n    ```erlang\n    re:run(\"ABCabcdABC\",\".*(? abcd).*\",[{capture,['FOO']}]).\n    ```\n\n    This would give the same result as the earlier examples, namely:\n\n    ```erlang\n    {match,[{3,4}]}\n    ```\n\n    The values list can specify indexes or names not present in the regular\n    expression, in which case the return values vary depending on the type. If\n    the type is `index`, the tuple `{-1,0}` is returned for values with no\n    corresponding subpattern in the regular expression, but for the other types\n    (`binary` and `list`), the values are the empty binary or list,\n    respectively.\n\n  - **`Type`** - Optionally specifies how captured substrings are to be\n    returned. If omitted, the default of `index` is used.\n\n    `Type` can be one of the following:\n\n    - **`index`** - Returns captured substrings as pairs of byte indexes into\n      the subject string and length of the matching string in the subject (as if\n      the subject string was flattened with `erlang:iolist_to_binary/1` or\n      `unicode:characters_to_binary/2` before matching). Notice that option\n      `unicode` results in _byte-oriented_ indexes in a (possibly virtual)\n      _UTF-8 encoded_ binary. A byte index tuple `{0,2}` can therefore represent\n      one or two characters when `unicode` is in effect. This can seem\n      counter-intuitive, but has been deemed the most effective and useful way\n      to do it. To return lists instead can result in simpler code if that is\n      desired. This return type is the default.\n\n    - **`list`** - Returns matching substrings as lists of characters (Erlang\n      `t:string/0`s). It option `unicode` is used in combination with the \\\\C\n      sequence in the regular expression, a captured subpattern can contain\n      bytes that are not valid UTF-8 (\\\\C matches bytes regardless of character\n      encoding). In that case the `list` capturing can result in the same types\n      of tuples that `unicode:characters_to_list/2` can return, namely\n      three-tuples with tag `incomplete` or `error`, the successfully converted\n      characters and the invalid UTF-8 tail of the conversion as a binary. The\n      best strategy is to avoid using the \\\\C sequence when capturing lists.\n\n    - **`binary`** - Returns matching substrings as binaries. If option\n      `unicode` is used, these binaries are in UTF-8. If the \\\\C sequence is\n      used together with `unicode`, the binaries can be invalid UTF-8.\n\n  In general, subpatterns that were not assigned a value in the match are\n  returned as the tuple `{-1,0}` when `type` is `index`. Unassigned subpatterns\n  are returned as the empty binary or list, respectively, for other return\n  types. Consider the following regular expression:\n\n  ```text\n  \".*((? abdd)|a(..d)).*\"\n  ```\n\n  There are three explicitly capturing subpatterns, where the opening\n  parenthesis position determines the order in the result, hence\n  `((? abdd)|a(..d))` is subpattern index 1, `(? abdd)` is subpattern\n  index 2, and `(..d)` is subpattern index 3. When matched against the following\n  string:\n\n  ```text\n  \"ABCabcdABC\"\n  ```\n\n  the subpattern at index 2 does not match, as \"abdd\" is not present in the\n  string, but the complete pattern matches (because of the alternative\n  `a(..d)`). The subpattern at index 2 is therefore unassigned and the default\n  return value is:\n\n  ```erlang\n  {match,[{0,10},{3,4},{-1,0},{4,3}]}\n  ```\n\n  Setting the capture `Type` to `binary` gives:\n\n  ```erlang\n  {match,[<<\"ABCabcdABC\">>,<<\"abcd\">>,<<>>,<<\"bcd\">>]}\n  ```\n\n  Here the empty binary (`<<>>`) represents the unassigned subpattern. In the\n  `binary` case, some information about the matching is therefore lost, as\n  `<<>>` can also be an empty string captured.\n\n  If differentiation between empty matches and non-existing subpatterns is\n  necessary, use the `type` `index` and do the conversion to the final type in\n  Erlang code.\n\n  When option `global` is speciified, the `capture` specification affects each\n  match separately, so that:\n\n  ```erlang\n  re:run(\"cacb\",\"c(a|b)\",[global,{capture,[1],list}]).\n  ```\n\n  gives\n\n  ```erlang\n  {match,[[\"a\"],[\"b\"]]}\n  ```\n\nFor a descriptions of options only affecting the compilation step, see\n`compile/2`.","ref":"re.html#run/3"},{"type":"function","title":"re.split/2","doc":"Equivalent to  split(Subject, RE, []) .","ref":"re.html#split/2"},{"type":"function","title":"re.split/3","doc":"Splits the input into parts by finding tokens according to the regular\nexpression supplied.\n\nThe splitting is basically done by running a global regular\nexpression match and dividing the initial string wherever a match occurs. The\nmatching part of the string is removed from the output.\n\nAs in `run/3`, an `t:mp/0` compiled with option `unicode` requires `Subject` to\nbe a Unicode `charlist()`. If compilation is done implicitly and the `unicode`\ncompilation option is specified to this function, both the regular expression\nand `Subject` are to be specified as valid Unicode `charlist()`s.\n\nThe result is given as a list of \"strings\", the preferred data type specified in\noption `return` (default `iodata`).\n\nIf subexpressions are specified in the regular expression, the matching\nsubexpressions are returned in the resulting list as well. For example:\n\n```erlang\nre:split(\"Erlang\",\"[ln]\",[{return,list}]).\n```\n\ngives\n\n```erlang\n[\"Er\",\"a\",\"g\"]\n```\n\nwhile\n\n```erlang\nre:split(\"Erlang\",\"([ln])\",[{return,list}]).\n```\n\ngives\n\n```erlang\n[\"Er\",\"l\",\"a\",\"n\",\"g\"]\n```\n\nThe text matching the subexpression (marked by the parentheses in the regular\nexpression) is inserted in the result list where it was found. This means that\nconcatenating the result of a split where the whole regular expression is a\nsingle subexpression (as in the last example) always results in the original\nstring.\n\nAs there is no matching subexpression for the last part in the example (the\n\"g\"), nothing is inserted after that. To make the group of strings and the parts\nmatching the subexpressions more obvious, one can use option `group`, which\ngroups together the part of the subject string with the parts matching the\nsubexpressions when the string was split:\n\n```erlang\nre:split(\"Erlang\",\"([ln])\",[{return,list},group]).\n```\n\ngives\n\n```erlang\n[[\"Er\",\"l\"],[\"a\",\"n\"],[\"g\"]]\n```\n\nHere the regular expression first matched the \"l\", causing \"Er\" to be the first\npart in the result. When the regular expression matched, the (only)\nsubexpression was bound to the \"l\", so the \"l\" is inserted in the group together\nwith \"Er\". The next match is of the \"n\", making \"a\" the next part to be\nreturned. As the subexpression is bound to substring \"n\" in this case, the \"n\"\nis inserted into this group. The last group consists of the remaining string, as\nno more matches are found.\n\nBy default, all parts of the string, including the empty strings, are returned\nfrom the function, for example:\n\n```erlang\nre:split(\"Erlang\",\"[lg]\",[{return,list}]).\n```\n\ngives\n\n```erlang\n[\"Er\",\"an\",[]]\n```\n\nas the matching of the \"g\" in the end of the string leaves an empty rest, which\nis also returned. This behavior differs from the default behavior of the split\nfunction in Perl, where empty strings at the end are by default removed. To get\nthe \"trimming\" default behavior of Perl, specify `trim` as an option:\n\n```erlang\nre:split(\"Erlang\",\"[lg]\",[{return,list},trim]).\n```\n\ngives\n\n```erlang\n[\"Er\",\"an\"]\n```\n\nThe \"trim\" option says; \"give me as many parts as possible except the empty\nones\", which sometimes can be useful. You can also specify how many parts you\nwant, by specifying `{parts,`N`}`:\n\n```erlang\nre:split(\"Erlang\",\"[lg]\",[{return,list},{parts,2}]).\n```\n\ngives\n\n```erlang\n[\"Er\",\"ang\"]\n```\n\nNotice that the last part is \"ang\", not \"an\", as splitting was specified into\ntwo parts, and the splitting stops when enough parts are given, which is why the\nresult differs from that of `trim`.\n\nMore than three parts are not possible with this indata, so\n\n```erlang\nre:split(\"Erlang\",\"[lg]\",[{return,list},{parts,4}]).\n```\n\ngives the same result as the default, which is to be viewed as \"an infinite\nnumber of parts\".\n\nSpecifying `0` as the number of parts gives the same effect as option `trim`. If\nsubexpressions are captured, empty subexpressions matched at the end are also\nstripped from the result if `trim` or `{parts,0}` is specified.\n\nThe `trim` behavior corresponds exactly to the Perl default. `{parts,N}`, where\nN is a positive integer, corresponds exactly to the Perl behavior with a\npositive numerical third parameter. The default behavior of\n[`split/3`](`split/3`) corresponds to the Perl behavior when a negative integer\nis specified as the third parameter for the Perl routine.\n\nSummary of options not previously described for function [`run/3`](`run/3`):\n\n- **`{return,ReturnType}`** - Specifies how the parts of the original string are\n  presented in the result list. Valid types:\n\n  - **`iodata`** - The variant of `t:iodata/0` that gives the least copying of\n    data with the current implementation (often a binary, but do not depend on\n    it).\n\n  - **`binary`** - All parts returned as binaries.\n\n  - **`list`** - All parts returned as lists of characters (\"strings\").\n\n- **`group`** - Groups together the part of the string with the parts of the\n  string matching the subexpressions of the regular expression.\n\n  The return value from the function is in this case a `t:list/0` of\n  `t:list/0`s. Each sublist begins with the string picked out of the subject\n  string, followed by the parts matching each of the subexpressions in order of\n  occurrence in the regular expression.\n\n- **`{parts,N}`** - Specifies the number of parts the subject string is to be\n  split into.\n\n  The number of parts is to be a positive integer for a specific maximum number\n  of parts, and `infinity` for the maximum number of parts possible (the\n  default). Specifying `{parts,0}` gives as many parts as possible disregarding\n  empty parts at the end, the same as specifying `trim`.\n\n- **`trim`** - Specifies that empty parts at the end of the result list are to\n  be disregarded.

It converts between ISO Latin-1 characters and Unicode\ncharacters, but it can also convert between different Unicode encodings (like\nUTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32).\n\nThe default Unicode encoding in Erlang binaries is UTF-8, which is also the\nformat in which built-in functions and libraries in OTP expect to find binary\nUnicode data. In lists, Unicode data is encoded as integers, each integer\nrepresenting one character and encoded simply as the Unicode code point for the\ncharacter.\n\nOther Unicode encodings than integers representing code points or UTF-8 in\nbinaries are referred to as \"external encodings\". The ISO Latin-1 encoding is in\nbinaries and lists referred to as latin1-encoding.\n\nIt is recommended to only use external encodings for communication with external\nentities where this is required. When working inside the Erlang/OTP environment,\nit is recommended to keep binaries in UTF-8 when representing Unicode\ncharacters. ISO Latin-1 encoding is supported both for backward compatibility\nand for communication with external entities not supporting Unicode character\nsets.\n\nPrograms should always operate on a normalized form and compare\ncanonical-equivalent Unicode characters as equal. All characters should thus be\nnormalized to one form once on the system borders. One of the following\nfunctions can convert characters to their normalized forms\n`characters_to_nfc_list/1`, `characters_to_nfc_binary/1`,\n`characters_to_nfd_list/1` or `characters_to_nfd_binary/1`.

The binaries in the input can have characters\nencoded as one of the following:\n\n- ISO Latin-1 (0-255, one character per byte). Here, case parameter `InEncoding`\n  is to be specified as `latin1`.\n- One of the UTF-encodings, which is specified as parameter `InEncoding`.\n\nNote that integers in the list always represent code points regardless of\n`InEncoding` passed. If `InEncoding latin1` is passed, only code points < 256\nare allowed; otherwise, all valid unicode code points are allowed.\n\nIf `InEncoding` is `latin1`, parameter `Data` corresponds to the `t:iodata/0`\ntype, but for `unicode`, parameter `Data` can contain integers > 255 (Unicode\ncharacters beyond the ISO Latin-1 range), which makes it invalid as\n`t:iodata/0`.\n\nThe purpose of the function is mainly to convert combinations of Unicode\ncharacters into a pure Unicode string in list representation for further\nprocessing. For writing the data to an external entity, the reverse function\n`characters_to_binary/3` comes in handy.\n\nOption `unicode` is an alias for `utf8`, as this is the preferred encoding for\nUnicode characters in binaries. `utf16` is an alias for `{utf16,big}` and\n`utf32` is an alias for `{utf32,big}`. The atoms `big` and `little` denote big-\nor little-endian encoding.\n\nIf the data cannot be converted, either because of illegal Unicode/ISO Latin-1\ncharacters in the list, or because of invalid UTF encoding in any binaries, an\nerror tuple is returned. The error tuple contains the tag `error`, a list\nrepresenting the characters that could be converted before the error occurred\nand a representation of the characters including and after the offending\ninteger/bytes. The last part is mostly for debugging, as it still constitutes a\npossibly deep or mixed list, or both, not necessarily of the same depth as the\noriginal data. The error occurs when traversing the list and whatever is left to\ndecode is returned \"as is\".\n\nHowever, if the input `Data` is a pure binary, the third part of the error tuple\nis guaranteed to be a binary as well.\n\nErrors occur for the following reasons:\n\n- Integers out of range.\n\n  If `InEncoding` is `latin1`, an error occurs whenever an integer > 255 is\n  found in the lists.\n\n  If `InEncoding` is of a Unicode type, an error occurs whenever either of the\n  following is found:\n\n  - An integer > 16#10FFFF (the maximum Unicode character)\n  - An integer in the range 16#D800 to 16#DFFF (invalid range reserved for\n    UTF-16 surrogate pairs)\n\n- Incorrect UTF encoding.\n\n  If `InEncoding` is one of the UTF types, the bytes in any binaries must be\n  valid in that encoding.\n\n  Errors can occur for various reasons, including the following:\n\n  - \"Pure\" decoding errors (like the upper bits of the bytes being wrong).\n  - The bytes are decoded to a too large number.\n  - The bytes are decoded to a code point in the invalid Unicode range.\n  - Encoding is \"overlong\", meaning that a number should have been encoded in\n    fewer bytes.\n\n  The case of a truncated UTF is handled specially, see the paragraph about\n  incomplete binaries below.\n\n  If `InEncoding` is `latin1`, binaries are always valid as long as they contain\n  whole bytes, as each byte falls into the valid ISO Latin-1 range.\n\nA special type of error is when no actual invalid integers or bytes are found,\nbut a trailing `t:binary/0` consists of too few bytes to decode the last\ncharacter. This error can occur if bytes are read from a file in chunks or if\nbinaries in other ways are split on non-UTF character boundaries. An\n`incomplete` tuple is then returned instead of the `error` tuple. It consists of\nthe same parts as the `error` tuple, but the tag is `incomplete` instead of\n`error` and the last element is always guaranteed to be a binary consisting of\nthe first part of a (so far) valid UTF character.\n\nIf one UTF character is split over two consecutive binaries in the `Data`, the\nconversion succeeds. This means that a character can be decoded from a range of\nbinaries as long as the whole range is specified as input without errors\noccurring.\n\n_Example:_\n\n```erlang\ndecode_data(Data) ->\n   case unicode:characters_to_list(Data,unicode) of\n      {incomplete,Encoded, Rest} ->\n            More = get_some_more_data(),\n            Encoded ++ decode_data([Rest, More]);\n      {error,Encoded,Rest} ->\n            handle_error(Encoded,Rest);\n      List ->\n            List\n   end.\n```\n\nHowever, bit strings that are not whole bytes are not allowed, so a UTF\ncharacter must be split along 8-bit boundaries to ever be decoded.\n\nA `badarg` exception is thrown for the following cases:\n\n- Any parameters are of the wrong type.\n- The list structure is invalid (a number as tail).\n- The binaries do not contain whole bytes (bit strings).","ref":"unicode.html#characters_to_list/2"},{"type":"function","title":"unicode.characters_to_nfc_binary/1","doc":"Converts a

3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt)) and form-urlencoded query\nstrings ([HTML 5.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/)).\n\nParsing and serializing non-UTF-8 form-urlencoded query strings are also\nsupported ([HTML 5.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/html50/)).\n\nA URI is an identifier consisting of a sequence of characters matching the\nsyntax rule named _URI_ in [RFC 3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt).\n\nThe generic URI syntax consists of a hierarchical sequence of components\nreferred to as the scheme, authority, path, query, and fragment:\n\n```text\n    URI         = scheme \":\" hier-part [ \"?\" query ] [ \"#\" fragment ]\n    hier-part   = \"//\" authority path-abempty\n                   / path-absolute\n                   / path-rootless\n                   / path-empty\n    scheme      = ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / \"+\" / \"-\" / \".\" )\n    authority   = [ userinfo \"@\" ] host [ \":\" port ]\n    userinfo    = *( unreserved / pct-encoded

used and not on how\nthose characters are represented in a network protocol.\n\nThe functions implemented by this module cover the following use cases:\n\n- Parsing URIs into its components and returing a map: `parse/1`\n- Recomposing a map of URI components into a URI string: `recompose/1`\n- Changing inbound binary and percent-encoding of URIs: `transcode/2`\n- Transforming URIs into a normalized form: `normalize/1`, `normalize/2`\n- Composing form-urlencoded query strings from a list of key-value pairs:\n  `compose_query/1`, `compose_query/2`\n- Dissecting form-urlencoded query strings into a list of key-value pairs:\n  `dissect_query/1`\n- Decoding percent-encoded triplets in URI map or a specific component of URI:\n  `percent_decode/1`\n- Preparing and retrieving application specific data included in URI\n  components:\n  `quote/1`, `quote/2`, `unquote/1`\n\nThere are four different encodings present during the handling of URIs:\n\n- Inbound binary encoding in binaries\n- Inbound percent-encoding in lists and binaries\n- Outbound binary encoding in binaries\n- Outbound percent-encoding in lists and binaries\n\nFunctions with `t:uri_string/0` argument accept lists, binaries and mixed lists\n(lists with binary elements) as input type. All of the functions but\n[`transcode/2`](`transcode/2`) expects input as lists of unicode codepoints,\nUTF-8 encoded binaries and UTF-8 percent-encoded URI parts (\"%C3%B6\" corresponds\nto the unicode character \"ö\").\n\nUnless otherwise specified the return value type and encoding are the same as\nthe input type and encoding. That is, binary input returns binary output, list\ninput returns a list output but mixed input returns list output.\n\nIn case of lists there is only percent-encoding. In binaries, however, both\nbinary encoding and percent-encoding shall be considered.\n[`transcode/2`](`transcode/2`) provides the means to convert between the\nsupported encodings, it takes a `t:uri_string/0` and a list of options\nspecifying inbound and outbound encodings.\n\n[RFC 3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) does not mandate any specific\ncharacter encoding and it is usually defined by the protocol or surrounding\ntext. This library takes the same assumption, binary and percent-encoding are\nhandled as one configuration unit, they cannot be set to different values.\n\nQuoting functions are intended to be used by URI producing application during\ncomponent preparation or retrieval phase to avoid conflicts between data and\ncharacters used in URI syntax. Quoting functions use percent encoding, but with\ndifferent rules than for example during execution of\n[`recompose/1`](`recompose/1`).

Before this release, the compiler would not catch this kind of error if the name of the imported function happened to be a BIF.  Consider this example:\n  \n  ```\n  -module(fun_example).\n  -export([foo/0, bar/0]).\n  -import(m, [max/2, not_a_bif/0]).\n  \n  foo() ->\n      fun max/2.\n  \n  bar() ->\n      fun not_a_bif/0.\n  ```\n  \n  The compiler in Erlang/OTP 27 would generate the following messages:\n  \n  ```text\n  fun_example.erl:9:5: function not_a_bif/0 undefined\n  %    9|     fun not_a_bif/0.\n  %     |     ^\n  \n  fun_example.erl:3:2: Warning: import directive overrides auto-imported BIF max/2 --\n  use \"-compile({no_auto_import,[max/2]}).\" to resolve name clash\n  %    3| -import(m, [max/2, not_a_bif/0]).\n  %     |  ^\n  ```\n  \n  That is, there would be a (cryptic) error for `fun not_a_bif/0`, but only a warning for `fun max/2`.\n  \n  When compiling with this release, both attempts to create a fun will result in error messages (as well as a warning):\n  \n  ```text\n  fun_example.erl:6:5: creating a fun from imported name max/2 is not allowed\n  %    6|     fun max/2.\n  %     |     ^\n  \n  fun_example.erl:9:5: creating a fun from imported name not_a_bif/0 is not allowed\n  %    9|     fun not_a_bif/0.\n  %     |     ^\n  \n  fun_example.erl:3:2: Warning: import directive overrides auto-imported BIF max/2 --\n  use \"-compile({no_auto_import,[max/2]}).\" to resolve name clash\n  %    3| -import(m, [max/2, not_a_bif/0]).\n  %     |  ^\n  ```\n  \n  Also, attempting to call a local function having the same name as auto-imported BIF would result in an error if the BIF was added to Erlang/OTP before R14, and a warning for newer BIFs. This has been changed to always emit a warning. For example:\n  \n  ```\n  -module(bif_example).\n  -export([bar/1]).\n  \n  bar(B) ->\n      is_boolean(B).\n  \n  is_boolean(B) ->\n          B =:= true orelse B =:= false.\n  ```\n  will now result in the following warning instead of an error:\n  \n  ```text\n  if_example.erl:5:5: Warning: ambiguous call of overridden auto-imported BIF is_boolean/1 --\n  use erlang:is_boolean/1 or \"-compile({no_auto_import,[is_boolean/1]}).\" to resolve name clash\n  %    5|     is_boolean(B).\n  %     |     ^\n  ```\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19432 Aux Id: [PR-9246]\n\n- It is now possible to use any base for floating point numbers as described in [EEP 75: Based Floating Point Literals](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0075).\n  \n  Computers represent floating point numbers in binary, but such numbers are typically printed using base ten, for example 0.314159265e1. To maintain exact bit-level precision when converting numbers to and from text, it is better to use a base that matches the internally used base, such as 16 for a compact but still exact representation, or 2 for visualizing or writing down the exact internal format. One particular case where such exact representations are useful is in code generating tools.\n  \n  Examples:\n  \n  ```\n  > 2#0.111.\n  0.875\n  > 16#fefe.fefe#e16.\n  1.2041849337671418e24\n  ```\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19452 Aux Id: [PR-9106]\n\n- The callback function `handle_continue/2` in `gen_server` callback modules is now cached like the others, thanks to code cleanup and optimization of the internal behaviour loop.\n  \n  This should only improve performance, not affect functionality.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19474 Aux Id: [PR-9333]\n\n- Encoding done by the `m:json` module has been optimized.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19476 Aux Id: [PR-9251]\n\n- There is a new `m:zstd` module that does [Zstandard](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/) compression.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19477 Aux Id: [PR-9316]\n\n- Fixed licenses in files and added ORT curations to the following apps: otp, eldap, erl_interface, eunit, parsetools, stdlib, syntax_tools, and ERTS.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19478 Aux Id: [PR-9376], [PR-9402], [PR-9819]\n\n- Functions of a module can now be grouped in the shell code completion by using the *group* key in the *-doc* attribute e.g. ```\n  -doc(#{group=><<\"Public API\">>).\n  fetch()->...\n  ```.\n  \n  Functions, callbacks and types in the module reference documentation of OTP is now grouped using this feature.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19483 Aux Id: [PR-9408]\n\n- Added calendar:universal_time_to_system_time/1,2 and calendar:local_time_to_system_time/1,2\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19505 Aux Id: [PR-9445]\n\n- Improve error messages for `json:decode/1`.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19508 Aux Id: [PR-9484]\n\n- ETS `heir` can be set without getting an `ETS-TRANSFER` message.

When documentation attributes mark a type as hidden, they will not be part of the documentation.\n  \n  * The documentation from `moduledoc` and `doc` gets added by default to the binary beam file, following the format of [EEP-48](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0048).\n  \n  * Using the compiler flag `warn_missing_doc` will raise a warning when\n  `-doc` attributes are missing in exported functions, types, and callbacks.\n  \n  * Using the compiler flag `warn_missing_spec_documented` will raise a warning when\n  spec attributes are missing in documented functions, types, and callbacks.\n  \n  * `moduledoc`s and `doc`s may refer to external files to be embedded, such as `-doc {file, \"README.md\"}.`, which refers to the file `README.md` found in the current working directory.\n  \n  * The compiler warns about exported functions whose specs refer to hidden types. Thus, there will be warnings when a hidden type (meaning, the type is not part of the documentation) gets used in an exported function.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-18916 Aux Id: [PR-7936]\n\n- New `m:ets` functions `ets:first_lookup/1`, `ets:next_lookup/2`, `ets:prev_lookup/2` and `ets:last_lookup/1`. Example: `ets:next_lookup/1` is equivalent to `ets:next/2` followed by `ets:lookup/2` with the next key. The new combined functions are more efficient and with guaranteed atomicity.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-18923 Aux Id: [PR-6791]\n\n- The `maybe` expression is now enabled by default.\n  \n  To use `maybe` as an atom, it needs to be single-quoted. Alternatively, the `maybe` expression can be disabled by disabling the `maybe_expr` feature. That can be done by placing the following the line at the beginning of an Erlang source file:\n  \n  ```erlang\n  -feature(maybe_expr, disable).\n  ```\n  \n  Another way to disable the `maybe_expr` feature is by passing the `-disable-feature` option to `erlc`:\n  \n  ```text\n  erlc -disable-feature maybe_expr some_file.erl\n  ```\n\n  Own Id: OTP-18944 Aux Id: [PR-8067]\n\n- The compiler will now raise a warning when updating record/map literals. As an example, consider this module:\n  \n  ```erlang\n  -module(t).\n  -export([f/0]).\n  -record(r, {a,b,c}).\n  \n  f() ->\n      #r{a=1}#r{b=2}.\n  ```\n  \n  The compiler raises the following warning:\n  \n  ```text\n  1> c(t).\n  t.erl:6:12: Warning: expression updates a literal\n  %    6|     #r{a=1}#r{b=2}.\n  %     |            ^\n  ```\n\n  Own Id: OTP-18951 Aux Id: [PR-8069]\n\n- The documentation has been migrated to use Markdown and ExDoc.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-18955 Aux Id: [PR-8026]\n\n- Optimized `ets:foldl` and `ets:foldr` to use new `ets:next_lookup`. Also made them immune against table renaming.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-18993 Aux Id: [PR-8048]\n\n- Windows now supports all functions in `m:math`.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19001 Aux Id: [PR-8164]\n\n- `m:erl_lint` (and by extension the [`compiler`](`m:compile`)) will now warn for code using deprecated callbacks.\n  \n  The only callback currenly deprecated is `format_status/2` in [`gen_server`](`c:gen_server:format_status/2`), [`gen_event`](`c:gen_event:format_status/2`) and [`gen_statem`](`c:gen_server:format_status/2`).\n  \n  You can use `nowarn_deprecated_callback` to silence the warning.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19010 Aux Id: [PR-8205]\n\n- There is a new module [`json`](`m:json`) for encoding and decoding [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).\n  \n  Both encoding and decoding can be customized.

It is, however,\n  recommended to use the Logger API directly when writing new code.\n\n  Notice the following potential incompatibilities:\n\n  - Kernel configuration parameters `error_logger` still works, but is overruled\n    if the default handler's output destination is configured with Kernel\n    configuration parameter `logger`.\n\n    In general, parameters for configuring error logger are overwritten by new\n    parameters for configuring Logger.\n\n  - The concept of SASL error logging is deprecated, meaning that by default the\n    SASL application does not affect which log events are logged.\n\n    By default, supervisor reports and crash reports are logged by the default\n    Logger handler started by Kernel, and end up at the same destination\n    (terminal or file) as other standard log event from Erlang/OTP.\n\n    Progress reports are not logged by default, but can be enabled by setting\n    the primary log level to info, for example with the Kernel configuration\n    parameter `logger_level`.\n\n    To obtain backwards compatibility with the SASL error logging functionality\n    from earlier releases, set Kernel configuration parameter\n    `logger_sasl_compatible` to `true`. This prevents the default Logger handler\n    from logging any supervisor-, crash-, or progress reports. Instead, SASL\n    adds a separate Logger handler during application start, which takes care of\n    these log events. The SASL configuration parameters `sasl_error_logger` and\n    `sasl_errlog_type` specify the destination (terminal or file) and severity\n    level to log for these events.\n\n  Since Logger is new in Erlang/OTP 21.0, we do reserve the right to introduce\n  changes to the Logger API and functionality in patches following this release.\n  These changes might or might not be backwards compatible with the initial\n  version.\n\n  \\*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \\***\n\n  Own Id: OTP-13295\n\n- Add functions `calendar:system_time_to_local_time/2` and\n  `calendar:system_time_to_universal_time/2`.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-13413\n\n- Functions `rand:uniform_real/0` and `rand:uniform_real_s/1` have been added.\n  They produce uniformly distributed numbers in the range `0.0 =< X < 1.0` that\n  are as close to random real numbers as Normalized IEEE 754 Double Precision\n  allows. Because the random real number exactly `0.0` is infinitely improbable\n  they will never return exactly `0.0`.\n\n  These properties are useful when you need to call for example `math:log(X)` or\n  `1 / X` on a random value `X`, since that will never fail with a number from\n  these new functions.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-13764 Aux Id: PR-1574\n\n- Added maps:iterator/0 and maps:next/1 to be used for iterating over the\n  key-value associations in a map.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14012\n\n- Changed the default behaviour of `.erlang` loading: `.erlang` is no longer\n  loaded from the current directory. `c:erlangrc(PathList)` can be used to\n  search and load an `.erlang` file from user specified directories.\n\n  `escript`, `erlc`, `dialyzer` and `typer` no longer load an `.erlang` at all.\n\n  \\*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \\***\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14439\n\n- Added new uri_string module to stdlib for handling URIs (RFC 3986).\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14496\n\n- Update Unicode specification to version 10.0.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14503\n\n- `filelib:wildcard()` now allows characters with a special meaning to be\n  escaped using backslashes.\n\n  This is an incompatible change, but note that the use of backslashes in\n  wildcards would already work differently on Windows and Unix.

The limit is soft, which means\n  that the number of returned characters exceeds the limit with at most a\n  smallish amount. If the limit is set, the functions `format/3` and `fwrite/3`\n  try to distribute the number of characters evenly over the control sequences\n  `pPswW`. Furthermore, the control sequences `pPwP` try to distribute the\n  number of characters evenly over substructures.\n\n  A modification of the control sequences `pPwW` is that even if there is no\n  limit on the number of returned characters, all associations of a map are\n  printed to the same depth. The aim is to give a more consistent output as the\n  order of map keys is not defined.

That is, the record declaration:\n\n  \\-record(rec, \\{f1 :: float(), f2 = 42 :: integer(), f3 ::\n  some_mod:some_typ()\\}).\n\n  was translated by the parser to:\n\n  \\-record(rec, \\{f1 :: float() | 'undefined', f2 = 42 :: integer(), f3 ::\n  some_mod:some_typ() | 'undefined'\\}).\n\n  The rationale for this was that creation of a \"dummy\" `#rec{}` record should\n  not result in a warning from dialyzer that, for example, the implicit\n  initialization of the `#rec.f1` field violates its type declaration.\n\n  Problems: This seemingly innocent action has some unforeseen consequences.\n\n  For starters, there is no way for programmers to declare that e.g. only floats\n  make sense for the `f1` field of `#rec{}` records when there is no \"obvious\"\n  default initializer for this field. (This also affects tools like PropEr that\n  use these declarations produced by the Erlang parser to generate random\n  instances of records for testing purposes.)\n\n  It also means that dialyzer does not warn if e.g. an\n  [`is_atom/1`](`is_atom/1`) test or something more exotic like an\n  [`atom_to_list/1`](`atom_to_list/1`) call is performed on the value of the\n  `f1` field.\n\n  Similarly, there is no way to extend dialyzer to warn if it finds record\n  constructions where `f1` is not initialized to some float.\n\n  Last but not least, it is semantically problematic when the type of the field\n  is an opaque type: creating a union of an opaque and a structured type is very\n  problematic for analysis because it fundamentally breaks the opacity of the\n  term at that point.\n\n  Change: To solve these problems the parser will not automatically insert the\n  `'undefined'` value anymore; instead the user has the option to choose the\n  places where this value makes sense (for the field) and where it does not and\n  insert the `| 'undefined'` there manually.\n\n  Consequences of this change: This change means that dialyzer will issue a\n  warning for all places where records with uninitialized fields are created and\n  those fields have a declared type that is incompatible with `'undefined'`\n  (e.g. `t:float/0`). This warning can be suppressed easily by adding\n  `| 'undefined'` to the type of this field.

The previous\n  implementations performed these kinds of garbage collections without\n  considering the internal state of the process being garbage collected. In\n  order to be able to more easily and more efficiently implement yielding native\n  code, these types of garbage collections have been rewritten. A garbage\n  collection like this is now triggered by an asynchronous request signal, the\n  actual garbage collection is performed by the process being garbage collected\n  itself, and finalized by a reply signal to the process issuing the request.\n  Using this approach processes can disable garbage collection and yield without\n  having to set up the heap in a state that can be garbage collected.\n\n  The [`garbage_collect/2`](`erlang:garbage_collect/2`), and\n  [`check_process_code/3`](`erlang:check_process_code/3`) BIFs have been\n  introduced. Both taking an option list as last argument. Using these, one can\n  issue asynchronous requests.\n\n  `code:purge/1` and `code:soft_purge/1` have been rewritten to utilize\n  asynchronous `check_process_code` requests in order to parallelize work.\n\n  Characteristics impact: A call to the\n  [`garbage_collect/1`](`garbage_collect/1`) BIF or the\n  [`check_process_code/2`](`check_process_code/2`) BIF will normally take longer\n  time to complete while the system as a whole wont be as much negatively\n  effected by the operation as before.

This bug has been corrected by changing the\n  behaviour of erlang:halt/0,1, which should fix the same problem for other\n  escript-like applications, i.e that data stored in the output port driver\n  buffers got lost when printing on a TTY and exiting through erlang:halt/0,1.\n\n  The BIF:s erlang:halt/0,1 has gotten improved semantics and there is a new BIF\n  erlang:halt/2 to accomplish something like the old semantics. See the\n  documentation.\n\n  Now erlang:halt/0 and erlang:halt/1 with an integer argument will close all\n  ports and allow all pending async threads operations to finish before exiting\n  the emulator. Previously erlang:halt/0 and erlang:halt(0) would just wait for\n  pending async threads operations but not close ports. And erlang:halt/1 with a\n  non-zero integer argument would not even wait for pending async threads\n  operations.\n\n  To roughly the old behaviour, to not wait for ports and async threads\n  operations when you exit the emulator, you use erlang:halt/2 with an integer\n  first argument and an option list containing \\{flush,false\\} as the second\n  argument. Note that now is flushing not dependant of the exit code, and you\n  cannot only flush async threads operations which we deemed as a strange\n  behaviour anyway.\n\n  Also, erlang:halt/1,2 has gotten a new feature: If the first argument is the\n  atom 'abort' the emulator is aborted producing a core dump, if the operating\n  system so allows.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-9985\n\n- Add escript win32 alternative invocation. escript can now be started as both\n  \"escript.exe\" and \"escript\" (Thanks to Pierre Rouleau)\n\n  Own Id: OTP-9997","ref":"notes.html#fixed-bugs-and-malfunctions-110"},{"type":"extras","title":"STDLIB 1.18 - STDLIB Release Notes","doc":"","ref":"notes.html#stdlib-1-18"},{"type":"extras","title":"Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions - STDLIB Release Notes","doc":"- Improved algorithm in module `random`.

Dynamic\n  children catch the exit signal from the supervisor and leave. But, if this\n  happens when we stop an application, after the top supervisor has stopped, the\n  application master kills all remaining processes associated to this\n  application. So, dynamic children that trap exit signals can be killed during\n  their cleanup (here we mean inside terminate/2). This is unpredictable and\n  highly time-dependent.\n\n  In this commit, supervisor module is patched to explicitly terminate dynamic\n  children accordingly to the shutdown strategy.\n\n  NOTE: Order in which dynamic children are stopped is not defined. In fact,\n  this is \"almost\" done at the same time.\n\n  Stack errors when dynamic children are stopped\n\n  Because a simple_one_for_one supervisor can have many workers, we stack errors\n  during its shutdown to report only one message for each encountered error\n  type.

However, when a temporary child is restarted as part of a\n  one_for_all or rest_for_one strategy where the failing process is not the\n  temporary child, the supervisor still tries to restart it.\n\n  Because the supervisor doesn't keep some of the MFA information of temporary\n  children, this causes the supervisor to hit its restart limit and crash.\n\n  This patch fixes the behaviour by inserting a clause in terminate_children/2-3\n  (private function) that will omit temporary children when building a list of\n  killed processes, to avoid having the supervisor trying to restart them again.\n\n  Only supervisors in need of restarting children used the list, so the change\n  should be of no impact for the functions that called terminate_children/2-3\n  only to kill all children.\n\n  The documentation has been modified to make this behaviour more explicit.\n  (Thanks to Fred Hebert)\n\n  Own Id: OTP-9502\n\n- fix broken edoc annotations (Thanks to Richard Carlsson)\n\n  Own Id: OTP-9516\n\n- XML files have been corrected.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-9550 Aux Id: OTP-9541\n\n- Handle rare race in the crypto key server functionality\n\n  Own Id: OTP-9586","ref":"notes.html#fixed-bugs-and-malfunctions-112"},{"type":"extras","title":"Improvements and New Features - STDLIB Release Notes","doc":"- Types and specifications have been added.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-9356\n\n- The contracts of the `queue` module have been modified.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-9418\n\n- Contracts in STDLIB and Kernel have been improved and type errors have been\n  corrected.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-9485\n\n- Types for several BIFs have been extended/corrected.

The `ethread`\n  library is an Erlang runtime system internal, portable thread library used by\n  the runtime system itself.\n\n  Most notable improvement is a reader optimized rwlock implementation which\n  dramatically improve the performance of read-lock/read-unlock operations on\n  multi processor systems by avoiding ping-ponging of the rwlock cache lines.\n  The reader optimized rwlock implementation is used by miscellaneous rwlocks in\n  the runtime system that are known to be read-locked frequently, and can be\n  enabled on ETS tables by passing the\n  [\\{read_concurrency, true\\}](`m:ets#new_2_read_concurrency`) option upon table\n  creation. See the documentation of `ets:new/2` for more information. The\n  reader optimized rwlock implementation can be fine tuned when starting the\n  runtime system. For more information, see the documentation of the\n  [\\+rg](`e:erts:erl_cmd.md#%2Brg`) command line argument of `erl`.\n\n  There is also a new implementation of rwlocks that is not optimized for\n  readers. Both implementations interleaves readers and writers during\n  contention as opposed to, e.g., the NPTL (Linux) pthread rwlock implementation\n  which use either a reader or writer preferred strategy. The reader/writer\n  preferred strategy is problematic since it starves threads doing the\n  non-preferred operation.\n\n  The new rwlock implementations in general performs better in ERTS than common\n  pthread implementations. However, in some extremely heavily contended cases\n  this is not the case. Such heavy contention can more or less only appear on\n  ETS tables. This when multiple processes do very large amounts of write locked\n  operations simultaneously on the same table. Such use of ETS is bad regardless\n  of rwlock implementation, will never scale, and is something we strongly\n  advise against.\n\n  The new rwlock implementations depend on atomic operations. If no native\n  atomic implementation is found, a fallback solution will be used. Using the\n  fallback implies a performance degradation. That is, it is more important now\n  than before to build OTP with a native atomic implementation.\n\n  The `ethread` library contains native atomic implementations for, x86 (32 and\n  64 bit), powerpc (32 bit), sparc V9 (32 and 64 bit), and tilera (32 bit). On\n  other hardware gcc's builtin support for atomic memory access will be used if\n  such exists. If no such support is found, `configure` will warn about no\n  atomic implementation available.\n\n  The `ethread` library can now also use the `libatomic_ops` library for atomic\n  memory accesses. This makes it possible for the Erlang runtime system to\n  utilize optimized native atomic operations on more platforms than before. If\n  `configure` warns about no atomic implementation available, try using the\n  `libatomic_ops` library. Use the\n  [\\--with-libatomic_ops=PATH](`e:system:install.md#advanced-configuration-and-build-of-erlang-otp`)\n  `configure` command line argument when specifying where the `libatomic_ops`\n  installation is located. The `libatomic_ops` library can be downloaded from:\n  [http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/](http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/)\n\n  The changed API of the `ethread` library has also caused modifications in the\n  Erlang runtime system. Preparations for the to come \"delayed deallocation\"\n  feature has also been done since it depends on the `ethread` library.\n\n  _Note_: When building for x86, the `ethread` library will now use instructions\n  that first appeared on the pentium 4 processor. If you want the runtime system\n  to be compatible with older processors (back to 486) you need to pass the\n  [\\--enable-ethread-pre-pentium4-compatibility](`e:system:install.md#advanced-configuration-and-build-of-erlang-otp`)\n  `configure` command line argument when configuring the system.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-8544\n\n- Some Built In Functions (BIFs) from the module erlang was never made\n  autoimported for backward compatibility reasons.

In an addendum to Robert\nVirding's rationale, the original I/O protocol is described. This section\ndescribes the current I/O protocol.\n\nThe original I/O protocol was simple and flexible. Demands for memory efficiency\nand execution time efficiency have triggered extensions to the protocol over the\nyears, making the protocol larger and somewhat less easy to implement than the\noriginal. It can certainly be argued that the current protocol is too complex,\nbut this section describes how it looks today, not how it should have looked.\n\nThe basic ideas from the original protocol still hold. The I/O server and client\ncommunicate with one single, rather simplistic protocol and no server state is\never present in the client. Any I/O server can be used together with any client\ncode, and the client code does not need to be aware of the I/O device that the\nI/O server communicates with.","ref":"io_protocol.html"},{"type":"extras","title":"Protocol Basics - The Erlang I/O Protocol","doc":"As described in Robert's paper, I/O servers and clients communicate using\n`io_request`/`io_reply` tuples as follows:\n\n```erlang\n{io_request, From, ReplyAs, Request}\n{io_reply, ReplyAs, Reply}\n```\n\nThe client sends an `io_request` tuple to the I/O server and the server\neventually sends a corresponding `io_reply` tuple.\n\n- `From` is the `t:pid/0` of the client, the process which the I/O server sends\n  the I/O reply to.\n- `ReplyAs` can be any datum and is returned in the corresponding `io_reply`.\n  The `m:io` module monitors the I/O server and uses the monitor reference as\n  the `ReplyAs` datum. A more complicated client can have many outstanding I/O\n  requests to the same I/O server and can use different references (or something\n  else) to differentiate among the incoming I/O replies. Element `ReplyAs` is to\n  be considered opaque by the I/O server.\n\n  Notice that the `t:pid/0` of the I/O server is not explicitly present in tuple\n  `io_reply`. The reply can be sent from any process, not necessarily the actual\n  I/O server.\n\n- `Request` and `Reply` are described below.\n\nWhen an I/O server receives an `io_request` tuple, it acts upon the `Request`\npart and eventually sends an `io_reply` tuple with the corresponding `Reply`\npart.","ref":"io_protocol.html#protocol-basics"},{"type":"extras","title":"Output Requests - The Erlang I/O Protocol","doc":"To output characters on an I/O device, the following `Request`s exist:\n\n```erlang\n{put_chars, Encoding, Characters}\n{put_chars, Encoding, Module, Function, Args}\n```\n\n- `Encoding` is `unicode` or `latin1`, meaning that the characters are (in case\n  of binaries) encoded as UTF-8 or ISO Latin-1 (pure bytes). A well-behaved I/O\n  server is also to return an error indication if list elements contain\n  integers > 255 when `Encoding` is set to `latin1`.\n\n  Notice that this does not in any way tell how characters are to be put on the\n  I/O device or handled by the I/O server.

If the\n  function supplied returns data as a list, the data is converted to this\n  encoding. If the function supplied returns data in some other format, no\n  conversion can be done, and it is up to the client-supplied function to return\n  data in a proper way.\n\n  If `Encoding` is `latin1`, lists of integers `0..255` or binaries containing\n  plain bytes are sent back to the client when possible. If `Encoding` is\n  `unicode`, lists with integers in the whole Unicode range or binaries encoded\n  in UTF-8 are sent to the client. The user-supplied function always sees lists\n  of integers, never binaries, but the list can contain numbers > 255 if\n  `Encoding` is `unicode`.\n\n- `Prompt` is a list of characters (not mixed, no binaries) or an atom to be\n  output as a prompt for input on the I/O device. `Prompt` is often ignored by\n  the I/O server; if set to `''`, it is always to be ignored (and results in\n  nothing being written to the I/O device).\n- `Module`, `Function`, and `ExtraArgs` denote a function and arguments to\n  determine when enough data is written. The function is to take two more\n  arguments, the last state, and a list of characters.

In this case `Result`\n    is sent to the client and `RestChars` is kept in the I/O server as a buffer\n    for later input.\n  - `{more, Continuation}`, which indicates that more characters are needed to\n    complete the request.\n\n  `Continuation` is sent as the state in later calls to the function when more\n  characters are available. When no more characters are available, the function\n  must return `{done, eof, Rest}`. The initial state is the empty list. The data\n  when an end of file is reached on the IO device is the atom `eof`.\n\n  An emulation of the `get_line` request can be (inefficiently) implemented\n  using the following functions:\n\n  ```erlang\n  -module(demo).\n  -export([until_newline/3, get_line/1]).\n\n  until_newline(_ThisFar,eof,_MyStopCharacter) ->\n      {done,eof,[]};\n  until_newline(ThisFar,CharList,MyStopCharacter) ->\n      case\n          lists:splitwith(fun(X) -> X =/= MyStopCharacter end,  CharList)\n      of\n  \t{L,[]} ->\n              {more,ThisFar++L};\n  \t{L2,[MyStopCharacter|Rest]} ->\n  \t    {done,ThisFar++L2++[MyStopCharacter],Rest}\n      end.\n\n  get_line(IoServer) ->\n      IoServer ! {io_request,\n                  self(),\n                  IoServer,\n                  {get_until, unicode, '', ?MODULE, until_newline, [$\\n]}},\n      receive\n          {io_reply, IoServer, Data} ->\n  \t    Data\n      end.\n  ```\n\n  Notice that the last element in the `Request` tuple (`[$\\n]`) is appended to\n  the argument list when the function is called. The function is to be called\n  like [`apply(Module, Function, [ State, Data | ExtraArgs ])`](`apply/3`) by\n  the I/O server.\n\nA fixed number of characters is requested using the following `Request`:\n\n```erlang\n{get_chars, Encoding, Prompt, N}\n```\n\n- `Encoding` and `Prompt` as for `get_until`.\n- `N` is the number of characters to be read from the I/O device.\n\nA single line (as in former example) is requested with the following `Request`:\n\n```erlang\n{get_line, Encoding, Prompt}\n```\n\n- `Encoding` and `Prompt` as for `get_until`.\n\nClearly, `get_chars` and `get_line` could be implemented with the `get_until`\nrequest (and indeed they were originally), but demands for efficiency have made\nthese additions necessary.\n\nThe I/O server replies to the client with an `io_reply` tuple, where element\n`Reply` is one of:\n\n```erlang\nData\neof\n{error, Error}\n```\n\n- `Data` is the characters read, in list or binary form (depending on the I/O\n  server mode, see the next section).\n- `eof` is returned when input end is reached and no more data is available to\n  the client process.\n- `Error` describes the error to the client, which can do whatever it wants with\n  it.

No options are mandatory to implement, but all\nI/O servers in the Erlang standard libraries honor the `binary` option, which\nallows element `Data` of the `io_reply` tuple to be a binary instead of a list\n_when possible_. If the data is sent as a binary, Unicode data is sent in the\nstandard Erlang Unicode format, that is, UTF-8 (notice that the function of the\n`get_until` request still gets list data regardless of the I/O server mode).\n\nNotice that the `get_until` request allows for a function with the data\nspecified as always being a list. Also, the return value data from such a\nfunction can be of any type (as is indeed the case when an\n[`io:fread/2,3`](`io:fread/2`) request is sent to an I/O server). The client\nmust be prepared for data received as answers to those requests to be in various\nforms. However, the I/O server is to convert the results to binaries whenever\npossible (that is, when the function supplied to `get_until` returns a list).\nThis is done in the example in section\n[An Annotated and Working Example I/O Server](io_protocol.md#example_io_server).\n\nAn I/O server in binary mode affects the data sent to the client, so that it\nmust be able to handle binary data. For convenience, the modes of an I/O server\ncan be set and retrieved using the following I/O requests:\n\n```erlang\n{setopts, Opts}\n```\n\n- `Opts` is a list of options in the format recognized by the `m:proplists`\n  module (and by the I/O server).\n\nAs an example, the I/O server for the interactive shell (in `group.erl`)\nunderstands the following options:\n\n```erlang\n{binary, boolean()} (or binary/list)\n{echo, boolean()}\n{expand_fun, fun()}\n{encoding, unicode/latin1} (or unicode/latin1)\n```\n\nOptions `binary` and `encoding` are common for all I/O servers in OTP, while\n`echo` and `expand` are valid only for this I/O server. Option `unicode`\nnotifies how characters are put on the physical I/O device, that is, if the\nterminal itself is Unicode-aware. It does not affect how characters are sent in\nthe I/O protocol, where each request contains encoding information for the\nprovided or returned data.\n\nThe I/O server is to send one of the following as `Reply`:\n\n```erlang\nok\n{error, Error}\n```\n\nAn error (preferably `enotsup`) is to be expected if the option is not supported\nby the I/O server (like if an `echo` option is sent in a `setopts` request to a\nplain file).\n\nTo retrieve options, the following request is used:\n\n```erlang\ngetopts\n```\n\nThis request asks for a complete list of all options supported by the I/O server\nas well as their current values.\n\nThe I/O server replies:\n\n```erlang\nOptList\n{error, Error}\n```\n\n- `OptList` is a list of tuples `{Option, Value}`, where `Option` always is an\n  atom.","ref":"io_protocol.html#i-o-server-modes"},{"type":"extras","title":"Multiple I/O Requests - The Erlang I/O Protocol","doc":"The `Request` element can in itself contain many `Request`s by using the\nfollowing format:\n\n```erlang\n{requests, Requests}\n```\n\n- `Requests` is a list of valid `io_request` tuples for the protocol.

There is no\ngeneric I/O server behavior, but could well be. The framework is simple, a\nprocess handling incoming requests, usually both I/O-requests and other I/O\ndevice-specific requests (positioning, closing, and so on).\n\nThe example I/O server stores characters in an ETS table, making up a fairly\ncrude RAM file.\n\nThe module begins with the usual directives, a function to start the I/O server\nand a main loop handling the requests:\n\n```erlang\n-module(ets_io_server).\n\n-export([start_link/0, init/0, loop/1, until_newline/3, until_enough/3]).\n\n-define(CHARS_PER_REC, 10).\n\n-record(state, {\n\t  table,\n\t  position, % absolute\n\t  mode % binary | list\n\t }).\n\nstart_link() ->\n    spawn_link(?MODULE,init,[]).\n\ninit() ->\n    Table = ets:new(noname,[ordered_set]),\n    ?MODULE:loop(#state{table = Table, position = 0, mode=list}).\n\nloop(State) ->\n    receive\n\t{io_request, From, ReplyAs, Request} ->\n\t    case request(Request,State) of\n\t\t{Tag, Reply, NewState} when Tag =:= ok; Tag =:= error ->\n\t\t    reply(From, ReplyAs, Reply),\n\t\t    ?MODULE:loop(NewState);\n\t\t{stop, Reply, _NewState} ->\n\t\t    reply(From, ReplyAs, Reply),\n\t\t    exit(Reply)\n\t    end;\n\t%% Private message\n\t{From, rewind} ->\n\t    From ! {self(), ok},\n\t    ?MODULE:loop(State#state{position = 0});\n\t_Unknown ->\n\t    ?MODULE:loop(State)\n    end.\n```\n\nThe main loop receives messages from the client (which can use the the `m:io`\nmodule to send requests). For each request, the function `request/2` is called\nand a reply is eventually sent using function `reply/3`.\n\nThe \"private\" message `{From, rewind}` results in the current position in the\npseudo-file to be reset to `0` (the beginning of the \"file\"). This is a typical\nexample of I/O device-specific messages not being part of the I/O protocol. It\nis usually a bad idea to embed such private messages in `io_request` tuples, as\nthat can confuse the reader.\n\nFirst, we examine the reply function:\n\n```erlang\nreply(From, ReplyAs, Reply) ->\n    From ! {io_reply, ReplyAs, Reply}.\n```\n\nIt sends the `io_reply` tuple back to the client, providing element `ReplyAs`\nreceived in the request along with the result of the request, as described\nearlier.\n\nWe need to handle some requests. First the requests for writing characters:\n\n```erlang\nrequest({put_chars, Encoding, Chars}, State) ->\n    put_chars(unicode:characters_to_list(Chars,Encoding),State);\nrequest({put_chars, Encoding, Module, Function, Args}, State) ->\n    try\n\trequest({put_chars, Encoding, apply(Module, Function, Args)}, State)\n    catch\n\t_:_ ->\n\t    {error, {error,Function}, State}\n    end;\n```\n\nThe `Encoding` says how the characters in the request are represented. We want\nto store the characters as lists in the ETS table, so we convert them to lists\nusing function `unicode:characters_to_list/2`. The conversion function\nconveniently accepts the encoding types `unicode` and `latin1`, so we can use\n`Encoding` directly.\n\nWhen `Module`, `Function`, and `Arguments` are provided, we apply it and do the\nsame with the result as if the data was provided directly.\n\nWe handle the requests for retrieving data:\n\n```erlang\nrequest({get_until, Encoding, _Prompt, M, F, As}, State) ->\n    get_until(Encoding, M, F, As, State);\nrequest({get_chars, Encoding, _Prompt, N}, State) ->\n    %% To simplify the code, get_chars is implemented using get_until\n    get_until(Encoding, ?MODULE, until_enough, [N], State);\nrequest({get_line, Encoding, _Prompt}, State) ->\n    %% To simplify the code, get_line is implemented using get_until\n    get_until(Encoding, ?MODULE, until_newline, [$\\n], State);\n```\n\nHere we have cheated a little by more or less only implementing `get_until` and\nusing internal helpers to implement `get_chars` and `get_line`. In production\ncode, this can be inefficient, but that depends on the frequency of the\ndifferent requests. Before we start implementing functions `put_chars/2` and\n`get_until/5`, we examine the few remaining requests:\n\n```erlang\nrequest({get_geometry,_}, State) ->\n    {error, {error,enotsup}, State};\nrequest({setopts, Opts}, State) ->\n    setopts(Opts, State);\nrequest(getopts, State) ->\n    getopts(State);\nrequest({requests, Reqs}, State) ->\n     multi_request(Reqs, {ok, ok, State});\n```\n\nRequest `get_geometry` has no meaning for this I/O server, so the reply is\n`{error, enotsup}`. The only option we handle is `binary`/`list`, which is done\nin separate functions.\n\nThe multi-request tag (`requests`) is handled in a separate loop function\napplying the requests in the list one after another, returning the last result.\n\n`{error, request}` must be returned if the request is not recognized:\n\n```erlang\nrequest(_Other, State) ->\n    {error, {error, request}, State}.\n```\n\nNext we handle the different requests, first the fairly generic multi-request\ntype:\n\n```erlang\nmulti_request([R|Rs], {ok, _Res, State}) ->\n    multi_request(Rs, request(R, State));\nmulti_request([_|_], Error) ->\n    Error;\nmulti_request([], Result) ->\n    Result.\n```\n\nWe loop through the requests one at the time, stopping when we either encounter\nan error or the list is exhausted. The last return value is sent back to the\nclient (it is first returned to the main loop and then sent back by function\n`io_reply`).\n\nRequests `getopts` and `setopts` are also simple to handle. We only change or\nread the state record:\n\n```erlang\nsetopts(Opts0,State) ->\n    Opts = proplists:unfold(\n\t     proplists:substitute_negations(\n\t       [{list,binary}],\n\t       Opts0)),\n    case check_valid_opts(Opts) of\n\ttrue ->\n\t        case proplists:get_value(binary, Opts) of\n\t\t    true ->\n\t\t\t{ok,ok,State#state{mode=binary}};\n\t\t    false ->\n\t\t\t{ok,ok,State#state{mode=binary}};\n\t\t    _ ->\n\t\t\t{ok,ok,State}\n\t\tend;\n\tfalse ->\n\t    {error,{error,enotsup},State}\n    end.\ncheck_valid_opts([]) ->\n    true;\ncheck_valid_opts([{binary,Bool}|T]) when is_boolean(Bool) ->\n    check_valid_opts(T);\ncheck_valid_opts(_) ->\n    false.\n\ngetopts(#state{mode=M} = S) ->\n    {ok,[{binary, case M of\n\t\t      binary ->\n\t\t\t  true;\n\t\t      _ ->\n\t\t\t  false\n\t\t  end}],S}.\n```\n\nAs a convention, all I/O servers handle both `{setopts, [binary]}`,\n`{setopts, [list]}`, and `{setopts,[{binary, boolean()}]}`, hence the trick with\n`proplists:substitute_negations/2` and `proplists:unfold/1`. If invalid options\nare sent to us, we send `{error, enotsup}` back to the client.\n\nRequest `getopts` is to return a list of `{Option, Value}` tuples. This has the\ntwofold function of providing both the current values and the available options\nof this I/O server. We have only one option, and hence return that.\n\nSo far this I/O server is fairly generic (except for request `rewind` handled in\nthe main loop and the creation of an ETS table). Most I/O servers contain code\nsimilar to this one.\n\nTo make the example runnable, we start implementing the reading and writing of\nthe data to/from the ETS table. First function `put_chars/3`:\n\n```erlang\nput_chars(Chars, #state{table = T, position = P} = State) ->\n    R = P div ?CHARS_PER_REC,\n    C = P rem ?CHARS_PER_REC,\n    [ apply_update(T,U) || U <- split_data(Chars, R, C) ],\n    {ok, ok, State#state{position = (P + length(Chars))}}.\n```\n\nWe already have the data as (Unicode) lists and therefore only split the list in\nruns of a predefined size and put each run in the table at the current position\n(and forward). Functions `split_data/3` and `apply_update/2` are implemented\nbelow.\n\nNow we want to read data from the table. Function `get_until/5` reads data and\napplies the function until it says that it is done. The result is sent back to\nthe client:\n\n```erlang\nget_until(Encoding, Mod, Func, As,\n\t  #state{position = P, mode = M, table = T} = State) ->\n    case get_loop(Mod,Func,As,T,P,[]) of\n\t{done,Data,_,NewP} when is_binary(Data); is_list(Data) ->\n\t    if\n\t\tM =:= binary ->\n\t\t    {ok,\n\t\t     unicode:characters_to_binary(Data, unicode, Encoding),\n\t\t     State#state{position = NewP}};\n\t\ttrue ->\n\t\t    case check(Encoding,\n\t\t               unicode:characters_to_list(Data, unicode))\n                    of\n\t\t\t{error, _} = E ->\n\t\t\t    {error, E, State};\n\t\t\tList ->\n\t\t\t    {ok, List,\n\t\t\t     State#state{position = NewP}}\n\t\t    end\n\t    end;\n\t{done,Data,_,NewP} ->\n\t    {ok, Data, State#state{position = NewP}};\n\tError ->\n\t    {error, Error, State}\n    end.\n\nget_loop(M,F,A,T,P,C) ->\n    {NewP,L} = get(P,T),\n    case catch apply(M,F,[C,L|A]) of\n\t{done, List, Rest} ->\n\t    {done, List, [], NewP - length(Rest)};\n\t{more, NewC} ->\n\t    get_loop(M,F,A,T,NewP,NewC);\n\t_ ->\n\t    {error,F}\n    end.\n```\n\nHere we also handle the mode (`binary` or `list`) that can be set by request\n`setopts`. By default, all OTP I/O servers send data back to the client as\nlists, but switching mode to `binary` can increase efficiency if the I/O server\nhandles it in an appropriate way. The implementation of `get_until` is difficult\nto get efficient, as the supplied function is defined to take lists as\narguments, but `get_chars` and `get_line` can be optimized for binary mode.\nHowever, this example does not optimize anything.\n\nIt is important though that the returned data is of the correct type depending\non the options set. We therefore convert the lists to binaries in the correct\nencoding _if possible_ before returning. The function supplied in the\n`get_until` request tuple can, as its final result return anything, so only\nfunctions returning lists can get them converted to binaries. If the request\ncontains encoding tag `unicode`, the lists can contain all Unicode code points\nand the binaries are to be in UTF-8. If the encoding tag is `latin1`, the client\nis only to get characters in the range `0..255`. Function `check/2` takes care\nof not returning arbitrary Unicode code points in lists if the encoding was\nspecified as `latin1`. If the function does not return a list, the check cannot\nbe performed and the result is that of the supplied function untouched.\n\nTo manipulate the table we implement the following utility functions:\n\n```erlang\ncheck(unicode, List) ->\n    List;\ncheck(latin1, List) ->\n    try\n\t[ throw(not_unicode) || X <- List,\n\t\t\t\tX > 255 ],\n\tList\n    catch\n\tthrow:_ ->\n\t    {error,{cannot_convert, unicode, latin1}}\n    end.\n```\n\nThe function check provides an error tuple if Unicode code points > 255 are to\nbe returned if the client requested `latin1`.\n\nThe two functions `until_newline/3` and `until_enough/3` are helpers used\ntogether with function `get_until/5` to implement `get_chars` and `get_line`\n(inefficiently):\n\n```erlang\nuntil_newline([],eof,_MyStopCharacter) ->\n    {done,eof,[]};\nuntil_newline(ThisFar,eof,_MyStopCharacter) ->\n    {done,ThisFar,[]};\nuntil_newline(ThisFar,CharList,MyStopCharacter) ->\n    case\n        lists:splitwith(fun(X) -> X =/= MyStopCharacter end,  CharList)\n    of\n\t{L,[]} ->\n            {more,ThisFar++L};\n\t{L2,[MyStopCharacter|Rest]} ->\n\t    {done,ThisFar++L2++[MyStopCharacter],Rest}\n    end.\n\nuntil_enough([],eof,_N) ->\n    {done,eof,[]};\nuntil_enough(ThisFar,eof,_N) ->\n    {done,ThisFar,[]};\nuntil_enough(ThisFar,CharList,N)\n  when length(ThisFar) + length(CharList) >= N ->\n    {Res,Rest} = my_split(N,ThisFar ++ CharList, []),\n    {done,Res,Rest};\nuntil_enough(ThisFar,CharList,_N) ->\n    {more,ThisFar++CharList}.\n```\n\nAs can be seen, the functions above are just the type of functions that are to\nbe provided in `get_until` requests.\n\nTo complete the I/O server, we only need to read and write the table in an\nappropriate way:\n\n```erlang\nget(P,Tab) ->\n    R = P div ?CHARS_PER_REC,\n    C = P rem ?CHARS_PER_REC,\n    case ets:lookup(Tab,R) of\n\t[] ->\n\t    {P,eof};\n\t[{R,List}] ->\n\t    case my_split(C,List,[]) of\n\t\t{_,[]} ->\n\t\t    {P+length(List),eof};\n\t\t{_,Data} ->\n\t\t    {P+length(Data),Data}\n\t    end\n    end.\n\nmy_split(0,Left,Acc) ->\n    {lists:reverse(Acc),Left};\nmy_split(_,[],Acc) ->\n    {lists:reverse(Acc),[]};\nmy_split(N,[H|T],Acc) ->\n    my_split(N-1,T,[H|Acc]).\n\nsplit_data([],_,_) ->\n    [];\nsplit_data(Chars, Row, Col) ->\n    {This,Left} = my_split(?CHARS_PER_REC - Col, Chars, []),\n    [ {Row, Col, This} | split_data(Left, Row + 1, 0) ].\n\napply_update(Table, {Row, Col, List}) ->\n    case ets:lookup(Table,Row) of\n\t[] ->\n\t    ets:insert(Table,{Row, lists:duplicate(Col,0) ++ List});\n\t[{Row, OldData}] ->\n\t    {Part1,_} = my_split(Col,OldData,[]),\n\t    {_,Part2} = my_split(Col+length(List),OldData,[]),\n\t    ets:insert(Table,{Row, Part1 ++ List ++ Part2})\n    end.\n```\n\nThe table is read or written in chunks of `?CHARS_PER_REC`, overwriting when\nnecessary. The implementation is clearly not efficient, it is just working.\n\nThis concludes the example. It is fully runnable and you can read or write to\nthe I/O server by using, for example, the `m:io` module or even the `m:file`\nmodule. It is as simple as that to implement a fully fledged I/O server in\nErlang.","ref":"io_protocol.html#an-annotated-and-working-example-i-o-server"},{"type":"extras","title":"Creating a custom shell","doc":"<!--\n%CopyrightBegin%\n\nSPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0\n\nCopyright Ericsson AB 2024-2025.

To do that we need to change the\nshell from running in `cooked` to `raw` mode. This is done by calling\n[`shell:start_interactive({noshell, raw})`](`shell:start_interactive/1`).\nWe can then use `io:get_chars/2` to read key strokes from the user. The key\nstrokes will be returned as [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code), \nso we will have need to handle the codes for up, down, left, right and enter.\n\nIt could look something like this:\n\n```\nmain(_Args) ->\n    ok = shell:start_interactive({noshell, raw}),\n    \n    io:put_chars(\"\\e[?1049h\"), %% Enable alternate screen buffer\n    io:put_chars(\"\\e[?25l\"), %% Hide the cursor\n    draw_board(),\n    loop(0),\n    io:put_chars(\"\\e[?25h\"), %% Show the cursor\n    io:put_chars(\"\\e[?1049l\"), %% Disable alternate screen buffer\n    ok.\n\nloop(Pos) ->\n    io:put_chars(draw_selection(Pos)),\n    %% Read at most 1024 characters from stdin.\n    Chars = io:get_chars(\"\", 1024),\n    case handle_input(Chars, Pos) of\n        stop -> stop;\n        NewPos ->\n            io:put_chars(clear_selection(Pos)),\n            loop(NewPos)\n    end.\n\nhandle_input(\"\\e[A\" ++ Rest, Pos) ->\n    %% Up key\n    handle_input(Rest, max(0, Pos - 3));\nhandle_input(\"\\e[B\" ++ Rest, Pos) ->\n    %% Down key\n    handle_input(Rest, min(8, Pos + 3));\nhandle_input(\"\\e[C\" ++ Rest, Pos) ->\n    %% right key\n    handle_input(Rest, min(8, Pos + 1));\nhandle_input(\"\\e[D\" ++ Rest, Pos) ->\n    %% left key\n    handle_input(Rest, max(0, Pos - 1));\nhandle_input(\"q\" ++ _, _State) ->\n    stop;\nhandle_input([_ | T], State) ->\n    handle_input(T, State);\nhandle_input([], State) ->\n    State.\n```\n\nNote that when using `io:get_chars/2` with the shell set in `{noshell, raw}` mode\nit will return as soon as any data is available.

The\nErlang Enhancement Proposal (EEP) 10 outlined the basics of Unicode support and\nspecified a default encoding in binaries that all Unicode-aware modules are to\nhandle in the future.\n\nHere is an overview what has been done so far:\n\n- The functionality described in EEP10 was implemented in Erlang/OTP R13A.\n- Erlang/OTP R14B01 added support for Unicode filenames, but it was not complete\n  and was by default disabled on platforms where no guarantee was given for the\n  filename encoding.\n- With Erlang/OTP R16A came support for UTF-8 encoded source code, with\n  enhancements to many of the applications to support both Unicode encoded\n  filenames and support for UTF-8 encoded files in many circumstances. Most\n  notable is the support for UTF-8 in files read by `file:consult/1`, release\n  handler support for UTF-8, and more support for Unicode character sets in the\n  I/O system.\n- In Erlang/OTP 17.0, the encoding default for Erlang source files was switched\n  to UTF-8.\n- In Erlang/OTP 20.0, atoms and function can contain Unicode characters. Module\n  names, application names, and node names are still restricted to the ISO\n  Latin-1 range.\n\n  Support was added for normalizations forms in `unicode` and the `string`\n  module now handles utf8-encoded binaries.\n\nThis section outlines the current Unicode support and gives some recipes for\nworking with Unicode data.","ref":"unicode_usage.html#unicode-implementation"},{"type":"extras","title":"Understanding Unicode - Using Unicode in Erlang","doc":"Experience with the Unicode support in Erlang has made it clear that\nunderstanding Unicode characters and encodings is not as easy as one would\nexpect. The complexity of the field and the implications of the standard require\nthorough understanding of concepts rarely before thought of.\n\nAlso, the Erlang implementation requires understanding of concepts that were\nnever an issue for many (Erlang) programmers. To understand and use Unicode\ncharacters requires that you study the subject thoroughly, even if you are an\nexperienced programmer.\n\nAs an example, contemplate the issue of converting between upper and lower case\nletters. Reading the standard makes you realize that there is not a simple one\nto one mapping in all scripts, for example:\n\n- In German, the letter \"ß\" (sharp s) is in lower case, but the uppercase\n  equivalent is \"SS\".\n- In Greek, the letter \"Σ\" has two different lowercase forms, \"ς\" in word-final\n  position and \"σ\" elsewhere.\n- In Turkish, both dotted and dotless \"i\" exist in lower case and upper case\n  forms.\n- Cyrillic \"I\" has usually no lowercase form.\n- Languages with no concept of upper case (or lower case).\n\nSo, a conversion function must know not only one character at a time, but\npossibly the whole sentence, the natural language to translate to, the\ndifferences in input and output string length, and so on. Erlang/OTP has\ncurrently no Unicode `uppercase`/`lowercase` functionality with language\nspecific handling, but publicly available libraries address these issues.\n\nAnother example is the accented characters, where the same glyph has two\ndifferent representations. The Swedish letter \"ö\" is one example. The Unicode\nstandard has a code point for it, but you can also write it as \"o\" followed by\n\"U+0308\" (Combining Diaeresis, with the simplified meaning that the last letter\nis to have \"¨\" above). They have the same glyph, user perceived character. They\nare for most purposes the same, but have different representations. For example,\nMacOS X converts all filenames to use Combining Diaeresis, while most other\nprograms (including Erlang) try to hide that by doing the opposite when, for\nexample, listing directories. However it is done, it is usually important to\nnormalize such characters to avoid confusion.\n\nThe list of examples can be made long. One need a kind of knowledge that was not\nneeded when programs only considered one or two languages. The complexity of\nhuman languages and scripts has certainly made this a challenge when\nconstructing a universal standard. Supporting Unicode properly in your program\nwill require effort.","ref":"unicode_usage.html#understanding-unicode"},{"type":"extras","title":"What Unicode Is - Using Unicode in Erlang","doc":"Unicode is a standard defining code points (numbers) for all known, living or\ndead, scripts. In principle, every symbol used in any language has a Unicode\ncode point. Unicode code points are defined and published by the Unicode\nConsortium, which is a non-profit organization.\n\nSupport for Unicode is increasing throughout the world of computing, as the\nbenefits of one common character set are overwhelming when programs are used in\na global environment. Along with the base of the standard, the code points for\nall the scripts, some _encoding standards_ are available.\n\nIt is vital to understand the difference between encodings and Unicode\ncharacters. Unicode characters are code points according to the Unicode\nstandard, while the encodings are ways to represent such code points. An\nencoding is only a standard for representation. UTF-8 can, for example, be used\nto represent a very limited part of the Unicode character set (for example\nISO-Latin-1) or the full Unicode range. It is only an encoding format.\n\nAs long as all character sets were limited to 256 characters, each character\ncould be stored in one single byte, so there was more or less only one practical\nencoding for the characters. Encoding each character in one byte was so common\nthat the encoding was not even named. With the Unicode system there are much\nmore than 256 characters, so a common way is needed to represent these. The\ncommon ways of representing the code points are the encodings. This means a\nwhole new concept to the programmer, the concept of character representation,\nwhich was a non-issue earlier.\n\nDifferent operating systems and tools support different encodings. For example,\nLinux and MacOS X have chosen the UTF-8 encoding, which is backward compatible\nwith 7-bit ASCII and therefore affects programs written in plain English the\nleast. Windows supports a limited version of UTF-16, namely all the code planes\nwhere the characters can be stored in one single 16-bit entity, which includes\nmost living languages.\n\nThe following are the most widely spread encodings:\n\n- **Bytewise representation** - This is not a proper Unicode representation, but\n  the representation used for characters before the Unicode standard. It can\n  still be used to represent character code points in the Unicode standard with\n  numbers < 256, which exactly corresponds to the ISO Latin-1 character set. In\n  Erlang, this is commonly denoted `latin1` encoding, which is slightly\n  misleading as ISO Latin-1 is a character code range, not an encoding.\n\n- **UTF-8** - Each character is stored in one to four bytes depending on code\n  point. The encoding is backward compatible with bytewise representation of\n  7-bit ASCII, as all 7-bit characters are stored in one single byte in UTF-8.\n  The characters beyond code point 127 are stored in more bytes, letting the\n  most significant bit in the first character indicate a multi-byte character.\n  For details on the encoding, the RFC is publicly available.\n\n  Notice that UTF-8 is _not_ compatible with bytewise representation for code\n  points from 128 through 255, so an ISO Latin-1 bytewise representation is\n  generally incompatible with UTF-8.\n\n- **UTF-16** - This encoding has many similarities to UTF-8, but the basic unit\n  is a 16-bit number. This means that all characters occupy at least two bytes,\n  and some high numbers four bytes. Some programs, libraries, and operating\n  systems claiming to use UTF-16 only allow for characters that can be stored in\n  one 16-bit entity, which is usually sufficient to handle living languages. As\n  the basic unit is more than one byte, byte-order issues occur, which is why\n  UTF-16 exists in both a big-endian and a little-endian variant.\n\n  In Erlang, the full UTF-16 range is supported when applicable, like in the\n  `m:unicode` module and in the bit syntax.\n\n- **UTF-32** - The most straightforward representation. Each character is stored\n  in one single 32-bit number. There is no need for escapes or any variable\n  number of entities for one character. All Unicode code points can be stored in\n  one single 32-bit entity. As with UTF-16, there are byte-order issues. UTF-32\n  can be both big-endian and little-endian.\n\n- **UCS-4** - Basically the same as UTF-32, but without some Unicode semantics,\n  defined by IEEE, and has little use as a separate encoding standard. For all\n  normal (and possibly abnormal) use, UTF-32 and UCS-4 are interchangeable.\n\nCertain number ranges are unused in the Unicode standard and certain ranges are\neven deemed invalid. The most notable invalid range is 16#D800-16#DFFF, as the\nUTF-16 encoding does not allow for encoding of these numbers. This is possibly\nbecause the UTF-16 encoding standard, from the beginning, was expected to be\nable to hold all Unicode characters in one 16-bit entity, but was then extended,\nleaving a hole in the Unicode range to handle backward compatibility.\n\nCode point 16#FEFF is used for Byte Order Marks (BOMs) and use of that character\nis not encouraged in other contexts. It is valid though, as the character\n\"ZWNBS\" (Zero Width Non Breaking Space). BOMs are used to identify encodings and\nbyte order for programs where such parameters are not known in advance. BOMs are\nmore seldom used than expected, but can become more widely spread as they\nprovide the means for programs to make educated guesses about the Unicode format\nof a certain file.","ref":"unicode_usage.html#what-unicode-is"},{"type":"extras","title":"Areas of Unicode Support - Using Unicode in Erlang","doc":"To support Unicode in Erlang, problems in various areas have been addressed.\nThis section describes each area briefly and more thoroughly later in this\nUser's Guide.\n\n- **Representation** - To handle Unicode characters in Erlang, a common\n  representation in both lists and binaries is needed. EEP (10) and the\n  subsequent initial implementation in Erlang/OTP R13A settled a standard\n  representation of Unicode characters in Erlang.\n\n- **Manipulation** - The Unicode characters need to be processed by the Erlang\n  program, which is why library functions must be able to handle them. In some\n  cases functionality has been added to already existing interfaces (as the\n  `m:string` module now can handle strings with any code points). In some cases\n  new functionality or options have been added (as in the `m:io` module, the\n  file handling, the `m:unicode` module, and the bit syntax). Today most modules\n  in Kernel and STDLIB, as well as the VM are Unicode-aware.\n\n- **File I/O** - I/O is by far the most problematic area for Unicode. A file is\n  an entity where bytes are stored, and the lore of programming has been to\n  treat characters and bytes as interchangeable. With Unicode characters, you\n  must decide on an encoding when you want to store the data in a file. In\n  Erlang, you can open a text file with an encoding option, so that you can read\n  characters from it rather than bytes, but you can also open a file for\n  bytewise I/O.\n\n  The Erlang I/O-system has been designed (or at least used) in a way where you\n  expect any I/O server to handle any string data. That is, however, no longer\n  the case when working with Unicode characters. The Erlang programmer must now\n  know the capabilities of the device where the data ends up. Also, ports in\n  Erlang are byte-oriented, so an arbitrary string of (Unicode) characters\n  cannot be sent to a port without first converting it to an encoding of choice.\n\n- **Terminal I/O** - Terminal I/O is slightly easier than file I/O. The output\n  is meant for human reading and is usually Erlang syntax (for example, in the\n  shell). There exists syntactic representation of any Unicode character without\n  displaying the glyph (instead written as `\\x`\\{`HHH`\\}). Unicode data can\n  therefore usually be displayed even if the terminal as such does not support\n  the whole Unicode range.\n\n- **Filenames** - Filenames can be stored as Unicode strings in different ways\n  depending on the underlying operating system and file system. This can be\n  handled fairly easy by a program. The problems arise when the file system is\n  inconsistent in its encodings. For example, Linux allows files to be named\n  with any sequence of bytes, leaving to each program to interpret those bytes.\n  On systems where these \"transparent\" filenames are used, Erlang must be\n  informed about the filename encoding by a startup flag. The default is\n  bytewise interpretation, which is usually wrong, but allows for interpretation\n  of _all_ filenames.\n\n  The concept of \"raw filenames\" can be used to handle wrongly encoded filenames\n  if one enables Unicode filename translation (`+fnu`) on platforms where this\n  is not the default.\n\n- **Source code encoding** - The Erlang source code has support for the UTF-8\n  encoding and bytewise encoding. The default in Erlang/OTP R16B was bytewise\n  (`latin1`) encoding. It was changed to UTF-8 in Erlang/OTP 17.0. You can\n  control the encoding by a comment like the following in the beginning of the\n  file:\n\n  ```erlang\n  %% -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n  ```\n\n  This of course requires your editor to support UTF-8 as well. The same comment\n  is also interpreted by functions like `file:consult/1`, the release handler,\n  and so on, so that you can have all text files in your source directories in\n  UTF-8 encoding.\n\n- **The language** - Having the source code in UTF-8 also allows you to write\n  string literals, function names, and atoms containing Unicode characters with\n  code points > 255. Module names, application names, and node names are still\n  restricted to the ISO Latin-1 range. Binary literals, where you use type\n  `/utf8`, can also be expressed using Unicode characters > 255. Having module\n  names or application names using characters other than 7-bit ASCII can cause\n  trouble on operating systems with inconsistent file naming schemes, and can\n  hurt portability, so it is not recommended.\n\n  EEP 40 suggests that the language is also to allow for Unicode characters >\n  255 in variable names. Whether to implement that EEP is yet to be decided.","ref":"unicode_usage.html#areas-of-unicode-support"},{"type":"extras","title":"Standard Unicode Representation - Using Unicode in Erlang","doc":"In Erlang, strings are lists of integers. A string was until Erlang/OTP R13\ndefined to be encoded in the ISO Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) character set, which is,\ncode point by code point, a subrange of the Unicode character set.\n\nThe standard list encoding for strings was therefore easily extended to handle\nthe whole Unicode range. A Unicode string in Erlang is a list containing\nintegers, where each integer is a valid Unicode code point and represents one\ncharacter in the Unicode character set.\n\nErlang strings in ISO Latin-1 are a subset of Unicode strings.\n\nOnly if a string contains code points < 256, can it be directly converted to a\nbinary by using, for example, `erlang:iolist_to_binary/1` or can be sent\ndirectly to a port. If the string contains Unicode characters > 255, an encoding\nmust be decided upon and the string is to be converted to a binary in the\npreferred encoding using\n[`unicode:characters_to_binary/1,2,3`](`unicode:characters_to_binary/1`).\nStrings are not generally lists of bytes, as they were before Erlang/OTP R13,\nthey are lists of characters. Characters are not generally bytes, they are\nUnicode code points.\n\nBinaries are more troublesome. For performance reasons, programs often store\ntextual data in binaries instead of lists, mainly because they are more compact\n(one byte per character instead of two words per character, as is the case with\nlists). Using `erlang:list_to_binary/1`, an ISO Latin-1 Erlang string can be\nconverted into a binary, effectively using bytewise encoding: one byte per\ncharacter. This was convenient for those limited Erlang strings, but cannot be\ndone for arbitrary Unicode lists.\n\nAs the UTF-8 encoding is widely spread and provides some backward compatibility\nin the 7-bit ASCII range, it is selected as the standard encoding for Unicode\ncharacters in binaries for Erlang.\n\nThe standard binary encoding is used whenever a library function in Erlang is to\nhandle Unicode data in binaries, but is of course not enforced when\ncommunicating externally. Functions and bit syntax exist to encode and decode\nboth UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 in binaries. However, library functions dealing\nwith binaries and Unicode in general only deal with the default encoding.\n\nCharacter data can be combined from many sources, sometimes available in a mix\nof strings and binaries. Erlang has for long had the concept of `iodata` or\n`iolist`s, where binaries and lists can be combined to represent a sequence of\nbytes. In the same way, the Unicode-aware modules often allow for combinations\nof binaries and lists, where the binaries have characters encoded in UTF-8 and\nthe lists contain such binaries or numbers representing Unicode code points:\n\n```erlang\nunicode_binary() = binary() with characters encoded in UTF-8 coding standard\n\nchardata() = charlist() | unicode_binary()\n\ncharlist() = maybe_improper_list(char() | unicode_binary() | charlist(),\n  unicode_binary() | nil())\n```\n\nThe module `m:unicode` even supports similar mixes with binaries containing\nother encodings than UTF-8, but that is a special case to allow for conversions\nto and from external data:\n\n```erlang\nexternal_unicode_binary() = binary() with characters coded in a user-specified\n  Unicode encoding other than UTF-8 (UTF-16 or UTF-32)\n\nexternal_chardata() = external_charlist() | external_unicode_binary()\n\nexternal_charlist() = maybe_improper_list(char() | external_unicode_binary() |\n  external_charlist(), external_unicode_binary() | nil())\n```","ref":"unicode_usage.html#standard-unicode-representation"},{"type":"extras","title":"Basic Language Support - Using Unicode in Erlang","doc":"[](){: #unicode_in_erlang } As from Erlang/OTP R16, Erlang source files can be\nwritten in UTF-8 or bytewise (`latin1`) encoding.

But what is a\nprintable character? One view is that anything the Unicode standard thinks is\nprintable, is also printable according to the heuristic detection. The result is\nthen that almost any list of integers are deemed a string, and all sorts of\ncharacters are printed, maybe also characters that your terminal lacks in its\nfont set (resulting in some unappreciated generic output). Another way is to\nkeep it backward compatible so that only the ISO Latin-1 character set is used\nto detect a string. A third way is to let the user decide exactly what Unicode\nranges that are to be viewed as characters.\n\nAs from Erlang/OTP R16B you can select the ISO Latin-1 range or the whole\nUnicode range by supplying startup flag `+pc latin1` or `+pc unicode`,\nrespectively.

There is no portable way for Erlang to ask the terminal about its\nUTF-8 capacity, we have to rely on the language and character type settings.\n\nTo investigate what Erlang thinks about the terminal, the call\n[`io:getopts()`](`io:getopts/1`) can be used when the shell is started:\n\n```erlang\n$ LC_CTYPE=en_US.ISO-8859-1 erl\nErlang R16B (erts-5.10.1) [source] [async-threads:0] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]\n\nEshell V5.10.1  (abort with ^G)\n1> lists:keyfind(encoding, 1, io:getopts()).\n{encoding,latin1}\n2> q().\nok\n$ LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 erl\nErlang R16B (erts-5.10.1) [source] [async-threads:0] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]\n\nEshell V5.10.1  (abort with ^G)\n1> lists:keyfind(encoding, 1, io:getopts()).\n{encoding,unicode}\n2>\n```\n\nWhen (finally?) everything is in order with the locale settings, fonts. and the\nterminal emulator, you have probably found a way to input characters in the\nscript you desire.

Ensure that you have a way to switch back and forth between keyboards\neasily if you are not used to this. For example, entering commands using a\nCyrillic character set is not easily done in the Erlang shell.\n\nNow you are set up for some Unicode input and output.

There are\nmany different ways to do this and Erlang by default treats the different\napproaches differently:\n\n- **Mandatory Unicode file naming** - Windows, Android and, for most cases,\n  MacOS X enforce Unicode support for filenames. All files created in the file\n  system have names that can consistently be interpreted. In MacOS X and\n  Android, all filenames are retrieved in UTF-8 encoding. In Windows, each\n  system call handling filenames has a special Unicode-aware variant, giving\n  much the same effect. There are no filenames on these systems that are not\n  Unicode filenames. So, the default behavior of the Erlang VM is to work in\n  \"Unicode filename translation mode\". This means that a filename can be\n  specified as a Unicode list, which is automatically translated to the proper\n  name encoding for the underlying operating system and file system.\n\n  Doing, for example, a `file:list_dir/1` on one of these systems can return\n  Unicode lists with code points > 255, depending on the content of the file\n  system.\n\n- **Transparent file naming** - Most Unix operating systems have adopted a\n  simpler approach, namely that Unicode file naming is not enforced, but by\n  convention. Those systems usually use UTF-8 encoding for Unicode filenames,\n  but do not enforce it. On such a system, a filename containing characters with\n  code points from 128 through 255 can be named as plain ISO Latin-1 or use\n  UTF-8 encoding. As no consistency is enforced, the Erlang VM cannot do\n  consistent translation of all filenames.\n\n  By default on such systems, Erlang starts in `utf8` filename mode if the\n  terminal supports UTF-8, otherwise in `latin1` mode.\n\n  In `latin1` mode, filenames are bytewise encoded. This allows for list\n  representation of all filenames in the system. However, a a file named\n  \"Östersund.txt\", appears in `file:list_dir/1` either as \"Östersund.txt\" (if\n  the filename was encoded in bytewise ISO Latin-1 by the program creating the\n  file) or more probably as `[195,150,115,116,101,114,115,117,110,100]`, which\n  is a list containing UTF-8 bytes (not what you want). If you use Unicode\n  filename translation on such a system, non-UTF-8 filenames are ignored by\n  functions like `file:list_dir/1`. They can be retrieved with function\n  `file:list_dir_all/1`, but wrongly encoded filenames appear as \"raw\n  filenames\".\n\nThe Unicode file naming support was introduced in Erlang/OTP R14B01. A VM\noperating in Unicode filename translation mode can work with files having names\nin any language or character set (as long as it is supported by the underlying\noperating system and file system). The Unicode character list is used to denote\nfilenames or directory names. If the file system content is listed, you also get\nUnicode lists as return value. The support lies in the Kernel and STDLIB\nmodules, which is why most applications (that do not explicitly require the\nfilenames to be in the ISO Latin-1 range) benefit from the Unicode support\nwithout change.\n\nOn operating systems with mandatory Unicode filenames, this means that you more\neasily conform to the filenames of other (non-Erlang) applications. You can also\nprocess filenames that, at least on Windows, were inaccessible (because of\nhaving names that could not be represented in ISO Latin-1). Also, you avoid\ncreating incomprehensible filenames on MacOS X, as the `vfs` layer of the\noperating system accepts all your filenames as UTF-8 does not rewrite them.\n\nFor most systems, turning on Unicode filename translation is no problem even if\nit uses transparent file naming. Very few systems have mixed filename encodings.\nA consistent UTF-8 named system works perfectly in Unicode filename mode. It was\nstill, however, considered experimental in Erlang/OTP R14B01 and is still not\nthe default on such systems.\n\nUnicode filename translation is turned on with switch `+fnu`. On Linux, a VM\nstarted without explicitly stating the filename translation mode defaults to\n`latin1` as the native filename encoding. On Windows, MacOS X and Android, the\ndefault behavior is that of Unicode filename translation. Therefore\n`file:native_name_encoding/0` by default returns `utf8` on those systems\n(Windows does not use UTF-8 on the file system level, but this can safely be\nignored by the Erlang programmer). The default behavior can, as stated earlier,\nbe changed using option `+fnu` or `+fnl` to the VM, see the\n[`erl`](`e:erts:erl_cmd.md`) program. If the VM is started in Unicode filename\ntranslation mode, `file:native_name_encoding/0` returns atom `utf8`. Switch\n`+fnu` can be followed by `w`, `i`, or `e` to control how wrongly encoded\nfilenames are to be reported.\n\n- `w` means that a warning is sent to the `error_logger` whenever a wrongly\n  encoded filename is \"skipped\" in directory listings. `w` is the default.\n- `i` means that wrongly encoded filenames are silently ignored.\n- `e` means that the API function returns an error whenever a wrongly encoded\n  filename (or directory name) is encountered.\n\nNotice that `file:read_link/1` always returns an error if the link points to an\ninvalid filename.\n\nIn Unicode filename mode, filenames given to BIF [`open_port/2`](`open_port/2`)\nwith option `{spawn_executable,...}` are also interpreted as Unicode. So is the\nparameter list specified in option `args` available when using\n`spawn_executable`. The UTF-8 translation of arguments can be avoided using\nbinaries, see section\n[Notes About Raw Filenames](unicode_usage.md#notes-about-raw-filenames).\n\nNotice that the file encoding options specified when opening a file has nothing\nto do with the filename encoding convention. You can very well open files\ncontaining data encoded in UTF-8, but having filenames in bytewise (`latin1`)\nencoding or conversely.\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> Erlang drivers and NIF-shared objects still cannot be named with names\n> containing code points > 127.

The reason \"raw filenames\" were introduced in the\nsystem was to be able to represent filenames, specified in different encodings\non the same system, consistently. It can seem practical to have the VM\nautomatically translate a filename that is not in UTF-8 to a list of Unicode\ncharacters, but this would open up for both duplicate filenames and other\ninconsistent behavior.\n\nConsider a directory containing a file named \"björn\" in ISO Latin-1, while the\nErlang VM is operating in Unicode filename mode (and therefore expects UTF-8\nfile naming). The ISO Latin-1 name is not valid UTF-8 and one can be tempted to\nthink that automatic conversion in, for example, `file:list_dir/1` is a good\nidea. But what would happen if we later tried to open the file and have the name\nas a Unicode list (magically converted from the ISO Latin-1 filename)? The VM\nconverts the filename to UTF-8, as this is the encoding expected. Effectively\nthis means trying to open the file named <<\"björn\"/utf8>>. This file does not\nexist, and even if it existed it would not be the same file as the one that was\nlisted. We could even create two files named \"björn\", one named in UTF-8\nencoding and one not. If `file:list_dir/1` would automatically convert the ISO\nLatin-1 filename to a list, we would get two identical filenames as the result.\nTo avoid this, we must differentiate between filenames that are properly encoded\naccording to the Unicode file naming convention (that is, UTF-8) and filenames\nthat are invalid under the encoding. By the common function `file:list_dir/1`,\nthe wrongly encoded filenames are ignored in Unicode filename translation mode,\nbut by function `file:list_dir_all/1` the filenames with invalid encoding are\nreturned as \"raw\" filenames, that is, as binaries.\n\nThe `file` module accepts raw filenames as input.\n`open_port({spawn_executable, ...} ...)` also accepts them. As mentioned\nearlier, the arguments specified in the option list to\n`open_port({spawn_executable, ...} ...)` undergo the same conversion as the\nfilenames, meaning that the executable is provided with arguments in UTF-8 as\nwell. This translation is avoided consistently with how the filenames are\ntreated, by giving the argument as a binary.\n\nTo force Unicode filename translation mode on systems where this is not the\ndefault was considered experimental in Erlang/OTP R14B01. This was because the\ninitial implementation did not ignore wrongly encoded filenames, so that raw\nfilenames could spread unexpectedly throughout the system. As from Erlang/OTP\nR16B, the wrongly encoded filenames are only retrieved by special functions\n(such as `file:list_dir_all/1`). Since the impact on existing code is therefore\nmuch lower it is now supported. Unicode filename translation is expected to be\ndefault in future releases.\n\nEven if you are operating without Unicode file naming translation automatically\ndone by the VM, you can access and create files with names in UTF-8 encoding by\nusing raw filenames encoded as UTF-8. Enforcing the UTF-8 encoding regardless of\nthe mode the Erlang VM is started in can in some circumstances be a good idea,\nas the convention of using UTF-8 filenames is spreading.","ref":"unicode_usage.html#notes-about-raw-filenames"},{"type":"extras","title":"Notes About MacOS X - Using Unicode in Erlang","doc":"The `vfs` layer of MacOS X enforces UTF-8 filenames in an aggressive way. Older\nversions did this by refusing to create non-UTF-8 conforming filenames, while\nnewer versions replace offending bytes with the sequence \"%HH\", where HH is the\noriginal character in hexadecimal notation. As Unicode translation is enabled by\ndefault on MacOS X, the only way to come up against this is to either start the\nVM with flag `+fnl` or to use a raw filename in bytewise (`latin1`) encoding. If\nusing a raw filename, with a bytewise encoding containing characters from 127\nthrough 255, to create a file, the file cannot be opened using the same name as\nthe one used to create it. There is no remedy for this behavior, except keeping\nthe filenames in the correct encoding.\n\nMacOS X reorganizes the filenames so that the representation of accents, and so\non, uses the \"combining characters\". For example, character `ö` is represented\nas code points `[111,776]`, where `111` is character `o` and `776` is the\nspecial accent character \"Combining Diaeresis\". This way of normalizing Unicode\nis otherwise very seldom used. Erlang normalizes those filenames in the opposite\nway upon retrieval, so that filenames using combining accents are not passed up\nto the Erlang application. In Erlang, filename \"björn\" is retrieved as\n`[98,106,246,114,110]`, not as `[98,106,117,776,114,110]`, although the file\nsystem can think differently.

Most options affect\nmainly how Unicode data is displayed, not the functionality of the APIs in the\nstandard libraries. This means that Erlang programs usually do not need to\nconcern themselves with these options, they are more for the development\nenvironment. An Erlang program can be written so that it works well regardless\nof the type of system or the Unicode options that are in effect.\n\nHere follows a summary of the settings affecting Unicode:\n\n- **The `LANG` and `LC_CTYPE` environment variables** - The language setting in\n  the operating system mainly affects the shell. The terminal (that is, the\n  group leader) operates with `{encoding, unicode}` only if the environment\n  tells it that UTF-8 is allowed. This setting is to correspond to the terminal\n  you are using.\n\n  The environment can also affect filename interpretation, if Erlang is started\n  with flag `+fna` (which is default from Erlang/OTP 17.0).\n\n  You can check the setting of this by calling [`io:getopts()`](`io:getopts/1`),\n  which gives you an option list containing `{encoding,unicode}` or\n  `{encoding,latin1}`.\n\n- **The `+pc` \\{`unicode`|`latin1`\\} flag to [`erl(1)`](`e:erts:erl_cmd.md`)** -\n  This flag affects what is interpreted as string data when doing heuristic\n  string detection in the shell and in `m:io`/\n  [`io_lib:format`](`io_lib:format/2`) with the `\"~tp\"` and `~tP` formatting\n  instructions, as described earlier.\n\n  You can check this option by calling `io:printable_range/0`, which returns\n  `unicode` or `latin1`. To be compatible with future (expected) extensions to\n  the settings, rather use `io_lib:printable_list/1` to check if a list is\n  printable according to the setting. That function takes into account new\n  possible settings returned from `io:printable_range/0`.\n\n- **The `+fn`\\{`l`|`u`|`a`\\} [\\{`w`|`i`|`e`\\}] flag to\n  [`erl(1)`](`e:erts:erl_cmd.md`)** - This flag affects how the filenames are to\n  be interpreted. On operating systems with transparent file naming, this must\n  be specified to allow for file naming in Unicode characters (and for correct\n  interpretation of filenames containing characters > 255).\n\n  - `+fnl` means bytewise interpretation of filenames, which was the usual way\n    to represent ISO Latin-1 filenames before UTF-8 file naming got widespread.\n  - `+fnu` means that filenames are encoded in UTF-8, which is nowadays the\n    common scheme (although not enforced).\n  - `+fna` means that you automatically select between `+fnl` and `+fnu`, based\n    on environment variables `LANG` and `LC_CTYPE`. This is optimistic\n    heuristics indeed, nothing enforces a user to have a terminal with the same\n    encoding as the file system, but this is usually the case. This is the\n    default on all Unix-like operating systems, except MacOS X.\n\n  The filename translation mode can be read with function\n  `file:native_name_encoding/0`, which returns `latin1` (bytewise encoding) or\n  `utf8`.\n\n- **`epp:default_encoding/0`** - This function returns the default encoding for\n  Erlang source files (if no encoding comment is present) in the currently\n  running release. In Erlang/OTP R16B, `latin1` (bytewise encoding) was\n  returned. As from Erlang/OTP 17.0, `utf8` is returned.\n\n  The encoding of each file can be specified using comments as described in the\n  [`epp`](`m:epp#encoding`) module.\n\n- **[`io:setopts/1,2`](`io:setopts/1`) and\n  [`standard_io_encoding`](`e:kernel:kernel_app.md#standard_io_encoding`)** -\n  When Erlang is started the encoding for [`standard_io`](`t:io:standard_io/0`)\n  is by default set to what the\n  [locale settings indicate](unicode_usage.md#the-interactive-shell).

This code outlines how\nto open a file that is believed to have a BOM, and sets the files encoding and\nposition for further sequential reading (preferably using the `m:io` module).\n\nNotice that error handling is omitted from the code:\n\n```erlang\nopen_bom_file_for_reading(File) ->\n    {ok,F} = file:open(File,[read,binary]),\n    {ok,Bin} = file:read(F,4),\n    {Type,Bytes} = unicode:bom_to_encoding(Bin),\n    file:position(F,Bytes),\n    io:setopts(F,[{encoding,Type}]),\n    {ok,F}.\n```\n\nFunction `unicode:bom_to_encoding/1` identifies the encoding from a binary of at\nleast four bytes. It returns, along with a term suitable for setting the\nencoding of the file, the byte length of the BOM, so that the file position can\nbe set accordingly. Notice that function `file:position/2` always works on\nbyte-offsets, so that the byte length of the BOM is needed.\n\nTo open a file for writing and place the BOM first is even simpler:\n\n```erlang\nopen_bom_file_for_writing(File,Encoding) ->\n    {ok,F} = file:open(File,[write,binary]),\n    ok = file:write(File,unicode:encoding_to_bom(Encoding)),\n    io:setopts(F,[{encoding,Encoding}]),\n    {ok,F}.\n```\n\nThe file is in both these cases then best processed using the `m:io` module, as\nthe functions in that module can handle code points beyond the ISO Latin-1\nrange.","ref":"unicode_usage.html#byte-order-marks"},{"type":"extras","title":"Formatted I/O - Using Unicode in Erlang","doc":"When reading and writing to Unicode-aware entities, like a file opened for\nUnicode translation, you probably want to format text strings using the\nfunctions in the `m:io` module or the `m:io_lib` module. For backward\ncompatibility reasons, these functions do not accept any list as a string, but\nrequire a special _translation modifier_ when working with Unicode texts. The\nmodifier is `t`. When applied to control character `s` in a formatting string,\nit accepts all Unicode code points and expects binaries to be in UTF-8:\n\n```erlang\n1> io:format(\"~ts~n\",[<<\"åäö\"/utf8>>]).\nåäö\nok\n2> io:format(\"~s~n\",[<<\"åäö\"/utf8>>]).\nÃ¥Ã¤Ã¶\nok\n```\n\nClearly, the second `io:format/2` gives undesired output, as the UTF-8 binary is\nnot in `latin1`. For backward compatibility, the non-prefixed control character\n`s` expects bytewise-encoded ISO Latin-1 characters in binaries and lists\ncontaining only code points < 256.\n\nAs long as the data is always lists, modifier `t` can be used for any string,\nbut when binary data is involved, care must be taken to make the correct choice\nof formatting characters. A bytewise-encoded binary is also interpreted as a\nstring, and printed even when using `~ts`, but it can be mistaken for a valid\nUTF-8 string. Avoid therefore using the `~ts` control if the binary contains\nbytewise-encoded characters and not UTF-8.\n\nFunction `io_lib:format/2` behaves similarly. It is defined to return a deep\nlist of characters and the output can easily be converted to binary data for\noutputting on any device by a simple `erlang:list_to_binary/1`. When the\ntranslation modifier is used, the list can, however, contain characters that\ncannot be stored in one byte. The call to `erlang:list_to_binary/1` then fails.\nHowever, if the I/O server you want to communicate with is Unicode-aware, the\nreturned list can still be used directly:\n\n```erlang\n$ erl +pc unicode\nErlang R16B (erts-5.10.1) [source] [async-threads:0] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]\n\nEshell V5.10.1 (abort with ^G)\n1> io_lib:format(\"~ts~n\", [\"Γιούνικοντ\"]).\n[\"Γιούνικοντ\",\"\\n\"]\n2> io:put_chars(io_lib:format(\"~ts~n\", [\"Γιούνικοντ\"])).\nΓιούνικοντ\nok\n```\n\nThe Unicode string is returned as a Unicode list, which is recognized as such,\nas the Erlang shell uses the Unicode encoding (and is started with all Unicode\ncharacters considered printable). The Unicode list is valid input to function\n`io:put_chars/2`, so data can be output on any Unicode-capable device. If the\ndevice is a terminal, characters are output in format `\\x{`H...`}` if encoding\nis `latin1`. Otherwise in UTF-8 (for the non-interactive terminal: \"oldshell\" or\n\"noshell\") or whatever is suitable to show the character properly (for an\ninteractive terminal: the regular shell).\n\nSo, you can always send Unicode data to the\n[`standard_io`](`t:io:standard_io/0`) device. Files, however, accept only\nUnicode code points beyond ISO Latin-1 if `encoding` is set to something else\nthan `latin1`.","ref":"unicode_usage.html#formatted-i-o"},{"type":"extras","title":"Heuristic Identification of UTF-8 - Using Unicode in Erlang","doc":"While it is strongly encouraged that the encoding of characters in binary data\nis known before processing, that is not always possible. On a typical Linux\nsystem, there is a mix of UTF-8 and ISO Latin-1 text files, and there are seldom\nany BOMs in the files to identify them.\n\nUTF-8 is designed so that ISO Latin-1 characters with numbers beyond the 7-bit\nASCII range are seldom considered valid when decoded as UTF-8. Therefore one can\nusually use heuristics to determine if a file is in UTF-8 or if it is encoded in\nISO Latin-1 (one byte per character). The `m:unicode` module can be used to\ndetermine if data can be interpreted as UTF-8:\n\n```erlang\nheuristic_encoding_bin(Bin) when is_binary(Bin) ->\n    case unicode:characters_to_binary(Bin,utf8,utf8) of\n\tBin ->\n\t    utf8;\n\t_ ->\n\t    latin1\n    end.\n```\n\nIf you do not have a complete binary of the file content, you can instead chunk\nthrough the file and check part by part. The return-tuple\n`{incomplete,Decoded,Rest}` from function\n[`unicode:characters_to_binary/1,2,3`](`unicode:characters_to_binary/1`) comes\nin handy. The incomplete rest from one chunk of data read from the file is\nprepended to the next chunk and we therefore avoid the problem of character\nboundaries when reading chunks of bytes in UTF-8 encoding:\n\n```erlang\nheuristic_encoding_file(FileName) ->\n    {ok,F} = file:open(FileName,[read,binary]),\n    loop_through_file(F,<<>>,file:read(F,1024)).\n\nloop_through_file(_,<<>>,eof) ->\n    utf8;\nloop_through_file(_,_,eof) ->\n    latin1;\nloop_through_file(F,Acc,{ok,Bin}) when is_binary(Bin) ->\n    case unicode:characters_to_binary([Acc,Bin]) of\n\t{error,_,_} ->\n\t    latin1;\n\t{incomplete,_,Rest} ->\n\t    loop_through_file(F,Rest,file:read(F,1024));\n\tRes when is_binary(Res) ->\n\t    loop_through_file(F,<<>>,file:read(F,1024))\n    end.\n```\n\nAnother option is to try to read the whole file in UTF-8 encoding and see if it\nfails. Here we need to read the file using function `io:get_chars/3`, as we have\nto read characters with a code point > 255:\n\n```erlang\nheuristic_encoding_file2(FileName) ->\n    {ok,F} = file:open(FileName,[read,binary,{encoding,utf8}]),\n    loop_through_file2(F,io:get_chars(F,'',1024)).\n\nloop_through_file2(_,eof) ->\n    utf8;\nloop_through_file2(_,{error,_Err}) ->\n    latin1;\nloop_through_file2(F,Bin) when is_binary(Bin) ->\n    loop_through_file2(F,io:get_chars(F,'',1024)).\n```","ref":"unicode_usage.html#heuristic-identification-of-utf-8"},{"type":"extras","title":"Lists of UTF-8 Bytes - Using Unicode in Erlang","doc":"For various reasons, you can sometimes have a list of UTF-8 bytes.

There is no real remedy for this other than to be sure of which data is\nencoded in which format, and never convert UTF-8 data (possibly read byte by\nbyte from a file) into UTF-8 again.\n\nBy far the most common situation where this occurs, is when you get lists of\nUTF-8 instead of proper Unicode strings, and then convert them to UTF-8 in a\nbinary or on a file:\n\n```erlang\nwrong_thing_to_do() ->\n  {ok,Bin} = file:read_file(\"an_utf8_encoded_file.txt\"),\n  MyList = binary_to_list(Bin), %% Wrong!

It is easier\nto explain this by an example.\n\nLet's say that we would like to create the following URI and send it over the\nnetwork: `http://cities/örebro?foo bar`. This is not a valid URI as it contains\ncharacters that are not allowed in a URI such as \"ö\" and the space. We can\nverify this by parsing the URI:\n\n```erlang\n  1> uri_string:parse(\"http://cities/örebro?foo bar\").\n  {error,invalid_uri,\":\"}\n```\n\nThe URI parser tries all possible combinations to interpret the input and fails\nat the last attempt when it encounters the colon character `\":\"`. Note, that the\ninital fault occurs when the parser attempts to interpret the character `\"ö\"`\nand after a failure back-tracks to the point where it has another possible\nparsing alternative.\n\nThe proper way to solve this problem is to use `uri_string:recompose/1` with a\n[`uri_map()`](`t:uri_string:uri_map/0`) as input:\n\n```erlang\n  2> uri_string:recompose(#{scheme => \"http\", host => \"cities\", path => \"/örebro\",\n  query => \"foo bar\"}).\n  \"http://cities/%C3%B6rebro?foo%20bar\"\n```\n\nThe result is a valid URI where all the special characters are encoded as\ndefined by the standard.

The\nfollowing example shows how to handle an input URI that is not normalized and\ncontains multiple percent-encoded triplets. First, the input\n[`uri_string()`](`t:uri_string:uri_string/0`) is to be parsed into a\n[`uri_map()`](`t:uri_string:uri_map/0`). The parsing only splits the URI into\nits components without doing any decoding:\n\n```text\n    3> uri_string:parse(\"http://%6C%6Fcal%23host/%F6re%26bro%20\").\n    #{host => \"%6C%6Fcal%23host\",path => \"/%F6re%26bro%20\",\n      scheme => \"http\"}}\n```\n\nThe input is a valid URI but how can you decode those percent-encoded octets?\nYou can try to normalize the input with `uri_string:normalize/1`. The normalize\noperation decodes those percent-encoded triplets that correspond to a character\nin the unreserved set. Normalization is a safe, idempotent operation that\nconverts a URI into its canonical form:\n\n```erlang\n    4> uri_string:normalize(\"http://%6C%6Fcal%23host/%F6re%26bro%20\").\n    \"http://local%23host/%F6re%26bro%20\"\n    5> uri_string:normalize(\"http://%6C%6Fcal%23host/%F6re%26bro%20\", [return_map]).\n    #{host => \"local%23host\",path => \"/%F6re%26bro%20\",\n      scheme => \"http\"}\n```\n\nThere are still a few percent-encoded triplets left in the output. At this\npoint, when the URI is already parsed, it is safe to apply application specific\ndecoding on the remaining character triplets. Erlang/OTP provides a function,\n`uri_string:percent_decode/1` for raw percent decoding that you can use on the\nhost and path components, or on the whole map:\n\n```erlang\n    6> uri_string:percent_decode(\"local%23host\").\n    \"local#host\"\n    7> uri_string:percent_decode(\"/%F6re%26bro%20\").\n    {error,invalid_utf8,<<\"/öre&bro \">>}\n    8> uri_string:percent_decode(#{host => \"local%23host\",path => \"/%F6re%26bro%20\",\n    scheme => \"http\"}).\n    {error,{invalid,{path,{invalid_utf8,<<\"/öre&bro \">>}}}}\n```\n\nThe `host` was successfully decoded but the path contains at least one character\nwith non-UTF-8 encoding. In order to be able to decode this, you have to make\nassumptions about the encoding used in these triplets. The most obvious choice\nis _latin-1_, so you can try `uri_string:transcode/2`, to transcode the path to\nUTF-8 and run the percent-decode operation on the transcoded string:\n\n```erlang\n    9> uri_string:transcode(\"/%F6re%26bro%20\", [{in_encoding, latin1}]).\n    \"/%C3%B6re%26bro%20\"\n    10> uri_string:percent_decode(\"/%C3%B6re%26bro%20\").\n    \"/öre&bro \"\n```\n\nIt is important to emphasize that it is not safe to apply\n`uri_string:percent_decode/1` directly on an input URI:\n\n```erlang\n    11> uri_string:percent_decode(\"http://%6C%6Fcal%23host/%C3%B6re%26bro%20\").\n    \"http://local#host/öre&bro \"\n    12> uri_string:parse(\"http://local#host/öre&bro \").\n    {error,invalid_uri,\":\"}\n```\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> Percent-encoding is implemented in `uri_string:recompose/1` and it happens\n> when converting a [`uri_map()`](`t:uri_string:uri_map/0`) into a\n> [`uri_string()`](`t:uri_string:uri_string/0`).

The last step is\napplying `uri_string:recompose/1` that converts the intermediate structure into\na valid canonical URI string.\n\nNotice the order, the\n[`uri_string:normalize(URIMap, [return_map])`](`uri_string:normalize/2`) that we\nused many times in this user guide is a shortcut in the normalization process\nreturning the intermediate datastructure, and allowing us to inspect and apply\nfurther decoding on the remaining percent-encoded triplets.\n\n```text\n    13> uri_string:normalize(\"hTTp://LocalHost:80/%c3%B6rebro/a/../b\").\n    \"http://localhost/%C3%B6rebro/b\"\n    14> uri_string:normalize(\"hTTp://LocalHost:80/%c3%B6rebro/a/../b\", [return_map]).\n    #{host => \"localhost\",path => \"/%C3%B6rebro/b\",\n      scheme => \"http\"}\n```","ref":"uri_string_usage.html#normalization"},{"type":"extras","title":"Special considerations - Uniform Resource Identifiers","doc":"The current URI implementation provides support for producing and consuming\nstandard URIs.

This upgrade brings Erlang's regular expression capabilities\nmore in line with modern standards, particularly Perl, but also introduces several breaking\nchanges and differences in behavior compared to PCRE.\n\nA key philosophical difference is that **PCRE2 is much stricter about pattern syntax**. Invalid\nconstructs that PCRE might have ignored or treated as literal characters will now typically raise\ncompilation errors, similar to using Perl in strict mode.\n\nBelow is a summary of notable incompatibilities and behavioral changes:","ref":"re_incompat.html"},{"type":"extras","title":"Stricter Error Handling & Syntax Validation - PCRE2 Migration","doc":"* **Invalid Escapes:** Undocumented escape sequences (for example, `\\M`, `\\i`) are now treated\n  as errors.

PCRE might have treated these literally.\n  * **Invalid Character Ranges:** Ranges where the start point is logically after the end point,\n  or involving incompatible types (for example, `[\\d-a]`), are now errors. PCRE might have\n  interpreted this as matching a digit, a hyphen, or 'a' literally.\n  * **Invalid Backreferences:** Using a backreference to a non-existent capturing group (for\n  example, `\\8` when only 7 groups exist) is now treated as an error.\n  * **Invalid Control Characters (`\\cx`):** The `\\c` escape must be followed by a character that\n  maps to a valid control character (typically ASCII characters `@` through `_`, corresponding to\n  `\\x00` through `\\x1F`, and `?` for `\\x7F`).

However, the named Unicode sequence\n  `\\N{U+...}` *is* allowed (for example, `[\\N{U+0041}]` to match 'A').\n  * **Empty Group Names:** Defining capturing groups with empty names using `(?''...)` syntax is\n  no longer supported and will cause an error.","ref":"re_incompat.html#syntax-changes-requirements"},{"type":"extras","title":"Option Handling - PCRE2 Migration","doc":"* **Compile-Time vs. Run-Time Options:** Options affecting newline conventions (`{newline, _}`)\n  or backslash R behavior (`bsr_anycrlf`, `bsr_unicode`) only control pattern *compilation*.\n  If a pattern is pre-compiled using `re:compile/2`, passing incompatible options for these\n  settings later to `re:run/3`, `re:replace/4`, or `re:split/3` will result in an error.\n  If present, the options must match those used at compile time.","ref":"re_incompat.html#option-handling"},{"type":"extras","title":"Behavioral Changes & Feature Restrictions - PCRE2 Migration","doc":"* **`\\K` in Lookarounds:** The `\\K` escape (reset match start) cannot be used inside lookahead\n  `(?=...)`, `(?!...)` or lookbehind `(?<=...)`, `(?<!...)` assertions.\n  * **`\\K` in global match:** does no longer produce a duplicate match.\n  * **`(*COMMIT)` with `no_start_optimize`:** The interaction between the `(*COMMIT)` verb and\n  the `no_start_optimize` option may lead to different behavior than might be expected based on\n  previous versions or other regex engines.

When an\nassertion fails, an exception of type `error` is generated. The associated error\nterm has the form `{Macro, Info}`. `Macro` is the macro name, for example,\n`assertEqual`. `Info` is a list of tagged values, such as\n`[{module, M}, {line, L}, ...]`, which gives more information about the location\nand cause of the exception. All entries in the `Info` list are optional; do not\nrely programmatically on any of them being present.\n\nEach assert macro has a corresponding version with an extra argument, for adding\ncomments to assertions. These can for example be printed as part of error\nreports, to clarify the meaning of the check that failed. For example,\n`?assertEqual(0, fib(0), \"Fibonacci is defined for zero\")`.
