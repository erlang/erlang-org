However sessions\n  may be invalidated earlier due to the maximum limitation of the session cache\n  table.\n\n- **`session_cb = atom()  `** - Deprecated Since OTP-23.3 replaced by\n  `client_session_cb` and `server_session_cb`\n\n- **`client_session_cb = atom()  `** - Since OTP-23.3 Name client of\n  the session cache callback module that implements the `ssl_session_cache_api`\n  behavior. Defaults to `ssl_client_session_cache_db`.\n\n- **`server_session_cb = atom()  `** - Since OTP-23.3 Name of the\n  server session cache callback module that implements the\n  `ssl_session_cache_api` behavior. Defaults to `ssl_server_session_cache_db`.\n\n- **`session_cb_init_args = proplist:proplist()  `** - Deprecated Since\n  OTP-23.3 replaced by `client_session_cb_init_args` and\n  `server_session_cb_init_args`\n\n- **`client_session_cb_init_args = proplist:proplist()  `** - List of\n  extra user-defined arguments to the `init` function in the session cache\n  callback module. Defaults to `[]`.\n\n- **`server_session_cb_init_args = proplist:proplist()  `** - List of\n  extra user-defined arguments to the `init` function in the session cache\n  callback module. Defaults to `[]`.\n\n- **`session_cache_client_max = integer()  `  \n  **  \n  Limits the growth of the clients session cache, that is how many sessions\n  towards servers that are cached to be used by new client connections. If the\n  maximum number of sessions is reached, the current cache entries will be\n  invalidated regardless of their remaining lifetime. Defaults to 1000.\n  Recommended ssl-8.2.1 or later for this option to work as intended.\n\n- **`session_cache_server_max = integer()  `** - Limits the growth of\n  the servers session cache, that is how many client sessions are cached by the\n  server. If the maximum number of sessions is reached, the current cache\n  entries will be invalidated regardless of their remaining lifetime. Defaults\n  to 1000. Recommended ssl-8.2.1 or later for this option to work as intended.\n\n- **`ssl_pem_cache_clean = integer()  `** - Number of milliseconds\n  between PEM cache validations. Defaults to 2 minutes.\n\n  Note: The cache can be reloaded by calling `ssl:clear_pem_cache/0`.\n\n- **`bypass_pem_cache = boolean()  `** - Introduced in ssl-8.0.2.\n  Disables the PEM-cache. Can be used as a workaround for the PEM-cache\n  bottleneck before ssl-8.1.1. Defaults to false.\n\n- **`alert_timeout = integer()  `** - Number of milliseconds between\n  sending of a fatal alert and closing the connection. Waiting a little while\n  improves the peers chances to properly receiving the alert so it may shutdown\n  gracefully. Defaults to 5000 milliseconds.\n\n- **`internal_active_n = integer()  `** - For TLS connections this\n  value is used to handle the internal socket. As the implementation was changed\n  from an active once to an active N behavior (N = 100), for performance\n  reasons, this option exist for possible tweaking or restoring of the old\n  behavior (internal_active_n = 1) in unforeseen scenarios. The option will not\n  affect erlang distribution over TLS that will always run in active N mode.\n  Added in ssl-9.1 (OTP-21.2).\n\n- **`server_session_tickets_amount = integer()  `** - Number of session\n  tickets sent by the server. It must be greater than 0. Defaults to 3.\n\n- **`server_session_ticket_lifetime = integer()  `** - Lifetime of\n  session tickets sent by the server. Servers must not use any value greater\n  than 604800 seconds (7 days). Expired tickets are automatically removed.\n  Defaults to 7200 seconds (2 hours).\n\n- **`server_session_ticket_store_size = integer()  `** - Sets the\n  maximum size of the server session ticket store (stateful tickets). Defaults\n  to 1000. Size limit is enforced by dropping old tickets.\n\n- **`server_session_ticket_max_early_data = integer()  `** - Sets the\n  maximum size of the early data that the server accepts and also configures its\n  NewSessionTicket messages to include this same size limit in their\n  early_data_indication extension. Defaults to 16384. Size limit is enforced by\n  both client and server.\n\n- **`client_session_ticket_lifetime = integer()  `** - Lifetime of\n  session tickets in the client ticket store. Expired tickets are automatically\n  removed. Defaults to 7200 seconds (2 hours).\n\n- **`client_session_ticket_store_size = integer()  `** - Sets the\n  maximum size of the client session ticket store. Defaults to 1000.

For such a cipher suite to be chosen it must also be\n  supported by the client and probably the only shared cipher suite.\n\n  Captured TLS sessions encrypted with ephemeral cipher suites (DHE or ECDHE)\n  are not at risk for subsequent decryption due to this vulnerability.\n\n  As a workaround if default cipher suite configuration was used you can\n  configure the server to not use vulnerable suites with the ciphers option like\n  this:\n\n  `{ciphers, [Suite || Suite <- ssl:cipher_suites(), element(1,Suite) =/= rsa]}`\n\n  that is your code will look somethingh like this:\n\n  `ssl:listen(Port, [{ciphers, [Suite || Suite <- ssl:cipher_suites(), element(1,S) =/= rsa]} | Options]).`\n\n  Thanks to Hanno Böck, Juraj Somorovsky and Craig Young for reporting this\n  vulnerability.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14748","ref":"notes.html#fixed-bugs-and-malfunctions-148"},{"type":"extras","title":"Improvements and New Features - SSL Release Notes","doc":"- Create a little randomness in sending of session invalidation messages, to\n  mitigate load when whole table is invalidated.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-13490","ref":"notes.html#improvements-and-new-features-64"},{"type":"extras","title":"SSL 7.3.2 - SSL Release Notes","doc":"","ref":"notes.html#ssl-7-3-2"},{"type":"extras","title":"Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions - SSL Release Notes","doc":"- Correct cipher suites conversion and guard expression.

The\nprotocol provides data/message confidentiality (encryption), integrity (through\nmessage authentication code checks) and host verification (through certificate\npath validation).

DTLS is by default run over\nUDP/IP, which means that application data has no delivery guarantees. Other\ntransports, such as SCTP, may be supported in future releases.\n\nIf a client and a server wants to use an upgrade mechanism, such as defined by\nRFC 2817, to upgrade a regular TCP/IP connection to a TLS connection, this is\nsupported by the Erlang SSL application API.

A session ticket is an opaque data structure that is sent in the\npre_shared_key extension of a ClientHello, when a client attempts to resume a\nsession with keying material from a previous successful handshake.\n\nSession tickets can be stateful or stateless. A stateful session ticket is a\ndatabase reference (session ticket store) and used with stateful servers, while\na stateless ticket is a self-encrypted and self-authenticated data structure\nwith cryptographic keying material and state data, enabling session resumption\nwith stateless servers.\n\nThe choice between stateful or stateless depends on the server requirements as\nthe session tickets are opaque for the clients.

However, a module that implements the protocol-specific parts of the\nconnection setup is needed. The default distribution module is `inet_tcp_dist`\nin the Kernel application. When starting an Erlang node distributed,\n`net_kernel` uses this module to set up listen ports and connections.\n\nIn the SSL application, an extra distribution module, `inet_tls_dist`, can be\nused as an alternative. All distribution connections will use TLS and all\nparticipating Erlang nodes in a distributed system must use this distribution\nmodule.\n\nThe security level depends on the parameters provided to the TLS connection\nsetup. Erlang node cookies are however always used, as they can be used to\ndifferentiate between two different Erlang networks.\n\nTo set up Erlang distribution over TLS:\n\n- _Step 1:_ Build boot scripts including the SSL application.\n- _Step 2:_ Specify the distribution module for `net_kernel`.\n- _Step 3:_ Specify the security options and other SSL options.\n- _Step 4:_ Set up the environment to always use TLS.\n\nThe following sections describe these steps.","ref":"ssl_distribution.html"},{"type":"extras","title":"Building Boot Scripts Including the SSL Application - Erlang Distribution over TLS","doc":"Boot scripts are built using the `systools` utility in the SASL application.

The source for the script is found under the Erlang installation\ntop directory under `releases/ /start_clean.rel`.\n\nDo the following:\n\n- Copy that script to another location (and preferably another name).\n- Add the applications Crypto, Public Key, and SSL with their current version\n  numbers after the STDLIB application.\n\nThe following shows an example `.rel` file with TLS added:\n\n```erlang\n      {release, {\"OTP  APN 181 01\",\"R15A\"}, {erts, \"5.9\"},\n      [{kernel,\"2.15\"},\n      {stdlib,\"1.18\"},\n      {crypto, \"2.0.3\"},\n      {public_key, \"0.12\"},\n      {asn1, \"4.0\"},\n      {ssl, \"5.0\"}\n      ]}.\n```\n\nThe version numbers differ in your system. Whenever one of the applications\nincluded in the script is upgraded, change the script.\n\nDo the following:\n\n- Build the boot script.\n\n  Assuming the `.rel file` is stored in a file `start_ssl.rel` in the current\n  directory, a boot script can be built as follows:\n\n```text\n   1> systools:make_script(\"start_ssl\",[]).\n```\n\nThere is now a `start_ssl.boot` file in the current directory.\n\nDo the following:\n\n- Test the boot script. To do this, start Erlang with the `-boot` command-line\n  parameter specifying this boot script (with its full path, but without the\n  `.boot` suffix). In UNIX it can look as follows:\n\n```text\n$ erl -boot /home/me/ssl/start_ssl\nErlang (BEAM) emulator version 5.0\n\nEshell V5.0  (abort with ^G)\n1> whereis(ssl_manager).\n<0.41.0>\n```\n\nThe `whereis` function-call verifies that the SSL application is started.\n\nAs an alternative to building a bootscript, you can explicitly add the path to\nthe SSL `ebin` directory on the command line. This is done with command-line\noption `-pa`. This works as the SSL application does not need to be started for\nthe distribution to come up, as a clone of the SSL application is hooked into\nthe Kernel application. So, as long as the SSL application code can be reached,\nthe distribution starts. The `-pa` method is only recommended for testing\npurposes.\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> The clone of the SSL application must enable the use of the SSL code in such\n> an early bootstage as needed to set up the distribution. However, this makes\n> it impossible to soft upgrade the SSL application.","ref":"ssl_distribution.html#building-boot-scripts-including-the-ssl-application"},{"type":"extras","title":"Specifying Distribution Module for net_kernel - Erlang Distribution over TLS","doc":"The distribution module for TLS is named `inet_tls_dist` and is specified on the\ncommand line with option `-proto_dist`.
