The Secure Shell (SSH)\nProtocol is a protocol for secure remote login and other secure network services\nover an insecure network. See [ssh](ssh_app.md#supported) for details of\nsupported RFCs, versions, algorithms and unicode handling.\n\nWith the SSH application it is possible to start _clients_ and to start\n_daemons_ (servers).\n\nClients are started with `connect/2`, `connect/3` or `connect/4`. They open an\nencrypted connection on top of TCP/IP. In that encrypted connection one or more\nchannels could be opened with\n[ssh_connection:session_channel/2,4](`ssh_connection:session_channel/2`).\n\nEach channel is an isolated \"pipe\" between a client-side process and a\nserver-side process. Those process pairs could handle for example file transfers\n(sftp) or remote command execution (shell, exec and/or cli). If a custom shell\nis implemented, the user of the client could execute the special commands\nremotely. Note that the user is not necessarily a human but probably a system\ninterfacing the SSH app.\n\nA server-side subssystem (channel) server is requested by the client with\n`ssh_connection:subsystem/4`.\n\nA server (daemon) is started with [daemon/1](`daemon/2`), `daemon/2` or\n[daemon/3](`daemon/2`). Possible channel handlers (subsystems) are declared with\nthe [subsystem](`t:subsystem_daemon_option/0`) option when the daemon is\nstarted.\n\nTo just run a shell on a remote machine, there are functions that bundles the\nneeded three steps needed into one: [shell/1,2,3](`shell/1`). Similarly, to just\nopen an sftp (file transfer) connection to a remote machine, the simplest way is\nto use [ssh_sftp:start_channel/1,2,3](`ssh_sftp:start_channel/1`).\n\nTo write your own client channel handler, use the behaviour\n`m:ssh_client_channel`. For server channel handlers use `m:ssh_server_channel`\nbehaviour (replaces ssh_daemon_channel).\n\nBoth clients and daemons accept options that control the exact behaviour. Some\noptions are common to both. The three sets are called\n[Client Options](`t:client_options/0`), [Daemon Options](`t:daemon_options/0`)\nand [Common Options](`t:common_options/0`).\n\nThe descriptions of the options uses the\n[Erlang Type Language](`e:system:typespec.md`) with explaining text.\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> See also [SSH Application Reference](index.html) and [Examples](using_ssh.md) section.","ref":"ssh.html"},{"type":"module","title":"Keys and files - ssh","doc":"A number of objects must be present for the SSH application to work.

The\n  default is to ask the user with a question on stdio of whether to accept or\n  reject the new Host Key. See the option\n  [`user_dir`](`t:ssh_file:user_dir_common_option/0`) for specifying the path to\n  the file `known_hosts` where previously accepted Host Keys are recorded. See\n  also the option [key_cb](`t:key_cb_common_option/0`) for the general way to\n  handle keys.\n\n  The option can be given in three different forms as seen\n  [above](`t:accept_hosts/0`):\n\n  - The value is a `t:boolean/0`. The value `true` will make the client accept\n    any unknown Host Key without any user interaction. The value `false`\n    preserves the default behaviour of asking the user on stdio.\n  - An `t:accept_callback/0` will be called and the boolean return value `true`\n    will make the client accept the Host Key. A return value of `false` will\n    make the client to reject the Host Key and as a result the connection will\n    be closed. The arguments to the fun are:\n    - `PeerName` \\- a string with the name or address of the remote host.\n    - `FingerPrint` \\- the fingerprint of the Host Key as\n      `hostkey_fingerprint/1` calculates it.\n  - A tuple `{HashAlgoSpec, accept_callback}`. The `HashAlgoSpec` specifies\n    which hash algorithm shall be used to calculate the fingerprint used in the\n    call of the `t:accept_callback/0`. The `HashALgoSpec` is either an atom or a\n    list of atoms as the first argument in `hostkey_fingerprint/2`. If it is a\n    list of hash algorithm names, the `FingerPrint` argument in the\n    `t:accept_callback/0` will be a list of fingerprints in the same order as\n    the corresponding name in the `HashAlgoSpec` list.\n\n- **`user_interaction`** - If `false`, disables the client to connect to the\n  server if any user interaction is needed, such as accepting the server to be\n  added to the `known_hosts` file, or supplying a password.\n\n  Even if user interaction is allowed it can be suppressed by other options,\n  such as `silently_accept_hosts` and `password`. However, those options are not\n  always desirable to use from a security point of view.\n\n  Defaults to `true`.\n\n- **`save_accepted_host`** - If `true`, the client saves an accepted host key to\n  avoid the accept question the next time the same host is connected.

The _initial\nwindow size_ specifies how many bytes of channel data that can be sent to the\nchannel peer without adjusting the window.

The reason is the different environments and use cases that are not\nimmediately obvious.\n\nThis chapter aims at explaining the differences and giving a rationale for why\nErlang/OTP handles \"user\" as it does.","ref":"terminology.html#the-term-user"},{"type":"extras","title":"In OpenSSH - Terminology","doc":"Many have been in contact with the command 'ssh' on a Linux machine (or similar)\nto remotly log in on another machine. One types\n\n```text\nssh host\n```\n\nto log in on the machine named `host`. The command prompts for your password on\nthe remote `host` and then you can read, write and execute as your _user name_\nhas rights on the remote `host`. There are stronger variants with\npre-distributed keys or certificates, but that are for now just details in the\nauthentication process.\n\nYou could log in as the user `anotheruser` with\n\n```text\nssh anotheruser@host\n```\n\nand you will then be enabled to act as `anotheruser` on the `host` if authorized\ncorrectly.\n\nSo what does _\"your user name has rights\"_ mean? In a UNIX/Linux/etc context it\nis exactly as that context: The _user_ could read, write and execute programs\naccording to the OS rules. In addition, the user has a home directory (`$HOME`)\nand there is a `$HOME/.ssh/` directory with ssh-specific files.\n\n#### SSH password authentication\n\nWhen SSH tries to log in to a host, the ssh protocol communicates the user name\n(as a string) and a password. The remote ssh server checks that there is such a\nuser defined and that the provided password is acceptable.\n\nIf so, the user is authorized.\n\n#### SSH public key authentication\n\nThis is a stronger method where the ssh protocol brings the user name, the\nuser's public key and some cryptographic information which we could ignore here.\n\nThe ssh server on the remote host checks:\n\n- That the _user_ has a home directory,\n- that home directory contains a .ssh/ directory and\n- the .ssh/ directory contains the public key just received in the\n  `authorized_keys` file\n\nif so, the user is authorized.\n\n#### The SSH server on UNIX/Linux/etc after a successful authentication\n\nAfter a successful incoming authentication, a new process runs as the just\nauthenticated user.\n\nNext step is to start a service according to the ssh request. In case of a\nrequest of a shell, a new one is started which handles the OS-commands that\narrives from the client (that's \"you\").\n\nIn case of a sftp request, an sftp server is started in with the user's rights.\nSo it could read, write or delete files if allowed for that user.","ref":"terminology.html#in-openssh"},{"type":"extras","title":"In Erlang/OTP SSH - Terminology","doc":"For the Erlang/OTP SSH server the situation is different. The server executes in\nan Erlang process in the Erlang emulator which in turn executes in an OS\nprocess. The emulator does not try to change its user when authenticated over\nthe SSH protocol. So the remote user name is only for authentication purposes in\nthe Erlang/OTP SSH application.\n\n#### Password authentication in Erlang SSH\n\nThe Erlang/OTP SSH server checks the user name and password in the following\norder:\n\n1. If a [`pwdfun`](`m:ssh#option-pwdfun`) is defined, that one is called and the\n   returned boolean is the authentication result.\n1. Else, if the [`user_passwords`](`m:ssh#option-user_passwords`) option is\n   defined and the username and the password matches, the authentication is a\n   success.\n1. Else, if the option [`password`](`m:ssh#option-password`) is defined and\n   matches the password the authentication is a success. Note that the use of\n   this option is not recommended in non-test code.\n\n#### Public key authentication in Erlang SSH\n\nThe user name, public key and cryptographic data (a signature) that is sent by\nthe client are used as follows (some steps left out for clarity):\n\n1. A callback module is selected using the options\n   [`key_cb`](`t:ssh:key_cb_common_option/0`).\n1. The callback module is used to check that the provided public key is one of\n   the user's pre-stored. In case of the default callback module, the files\n   `authorized_keys` and `authorized_keys2` are searched in a directory found in\n   the following order:\n\n- If the option [`user_dir_fun`](`t:ssh_file:user_dir_fun_common_option/0`) is\n  defined, that fun is called and the returned directory is used,\n- Else, If the option [`user_dir`](`t:ssh_file:user_dir_common_option/0`) is\n  defined, that directory is used,\n- Else the subdirectory `.ssh` in the home directory of the user executing the\n  OS process of the Erlang emulator is used.\n\nIf the provided public key is not found, the authentication fails.\n\n1. Finally, if the provided public key is found, the signature provided by the\n   client is checked with the public key.\n\n#### The Erlang/OTP SSH server after a successful authentication\n\nAfter a successful authentication an _Erlang process_ is handling the service\nrequest from the remote ssh client. The rights of that process are those of the\nuser of the OS process running the Erlang emulator.\n\nIf a shell service request arrives to the server, an _Erlang shell_ is opened in\nthe server's emulator. The rights in that shell is independent of the just\nauthenticated user.\n\nIn case of an sftp request, an sftp server is started with the rights of the\nuser of the Erlang emulator's OS process. So with sftp the authenticated user\ndoes not influence the rights.\n\nSo after an authentication, the user name is not used anymore and has no\ninfluence.","ref":"terminology.html#in-erlang-otp-ssh"},{"type":"extras","title":"Configuration in SSH","doc":"<!--\n%CopyrightBegin%\n\nSPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0\n\nCopyright Ericsson AB 2023-2025.

The config-file has the following contents:\n\n```text\n$ cat ex2.config\n[\n {ssh, [{preferred_algorithms, [{cipher, ['aes192-ctr']},\n       \t\t\t        {public_key, ['ssh-rsa']},\n                                {kex, ['ecdh-sha2-nistp384']},\n                                {mac, ['hmac-sha1']}]}]}\n].\n```\n\nErlang is started with `ex2.config` as configuration and we check the default\nset of algorithms before starting ssh:\n\n```text\n$ erl -config ex2\nErlang/OTP 23 [RELEASE CANDIDATE 1] [erts-10.6.4] [source-96a0823109] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [ds:4:4:10] [async-threads:1] [hipe]\n\nEshell V10.6.4  (abort with ^G)\n1> ssh:default_algorithms().\n[{kex,['ecdh-sha2-nistp384','ecdh-sha2-nistp521',\n       'ecdh-sha2-nistp256','diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256',\n       'diffie-hellman-group16-sha512',\n       'diffie-hellman-group18-sha512',\n       'diffie-hellman-group14-sha256','curve25519-sha256',\n       'curve25519-sha256@libssh.org','curve448-sha512',\n       'diffie-hellman-group14-sha1',\n       'diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1']},\n {public_key,['ecdsa-sha2-nistp384','ecdsa-sha2-nistp521',\n              'ecdsa-sha2-nistp256','ssh-ed25519','ssh-ed448','ssh-rsa',\n              'rsa-sha2-256','rsa-sha2-512','ssh-dss']},\n {cipher,[{client2server,['chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com',\n                          'aes256-gcm@openssh.com','aes256-ctr','aes192-ctr',\n                          'aes128-gcm@openssh.com','aes128-ctr','aes256-cbc',\n                          'aes192-cbc','aes128-cbc','3des-cbc']},\n          {server2client,['chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com',\n                          'aes256-gcm@openssh.com','aes256-ctr','aes192-ctr',\n                          'aes128-gcm@openssh.com','aes128-ctr','aes256-cbc',\n                          'aes192-cbc','aes128-cbc','3des-cbc']}]},\n {mac,[{client2server,['hmac-sha2-256','hmac-sha2-512',\n                       'hmac-sha1']},\n       {server2client,['hmac-sha2-256','hmac-sha2-512',\n                       'hmac-sha1']}]},\n {compression,[{client2server,[none,'zlib@openssh.com',zlib]},\n               {server2client,[none,'zlib@openssh.com',zlib]}]}]\n```\n\nNote that the algorithms in the file `ex2.config` is not yet applied. They will\nbe when we start ssh:\n\n```erlang\n2> ssh:start().\nok\n3> ssh:default_algorithms().\n[{kex,['ecdh-sha2-nistp384']},\n {public_key,['ssh-rsa']},\n {cipher,[{client2server,['aes192-ctr']},\n          {server2client,['aes192-ctr']}]},\n {mac,[{client2server,['hmac-sha1']},\n       {server2client,['hmac-sha1']}]},\n {compression,[{client2server,[none,'zlib@openssh.com',zlib]},\n               {server2client,[none,'zlib@openssh.com',zlib]}]}]\n4>\n```\n\nWe see that the algorithm set is changed to the one in the `ex2.config`. Since\n`compression` is not specified in the file, the hard-coded default is still used\nfor that entry.\n\n#### Establishing a connection (ssh:connect et al) or starting a daemon (ssh:daemon)\n\nBoth when the client establishes a connection with ssh:connect or other\nfunctions, or a daemon is started with ssh:daemon, the option lists in the\nfunction calls are also used.\n\nIf a client is started (ssh:connect et al), the environment variable\n`client_options` is used. Similarly for a daemon the `server_options` variable\nis handled.\n\nIf any [preferred_algorithms](`t:ssh:preferred_algorithms_common_option/0`) is\npresent, the one with the highest level is used, that is, the `Option` list\nparameter has the highest priority. Then the\n[modify_algorithms](`t:ssh:modify_algorithms_common_option/0`) on all levels in\norder starting with level 0 are applied.\n\nWe continue the example above by connecting to a server and modifying the `kex`\nalgorithm set. We remove the only one (`'ecdh-sha2-nistp384'`) and add\n`'curve25519-sha256@libssh.org'` by appending it to the now empty list:\n\n```erlang\n4> {ok,C} = ssh:connect(loopback, 22,\n                        [{modify_algorithms,\n                                 [{rm,\n                                     [ {kex,['ecdh-sha2-nistp384']} ]\n\t\t\t\t  },\n                                  {append,\n\t\t\t             [ {kex,['curve25519-sha256@libssh.org']} ]\n\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t ]\n\t                 }\n                        ]).\n{ok,>0.118.0>}\n```\n\nWe check which algorithms are negotiated by the client and the server, and note\nthat the (only) `kex` algorithm `'curve25519-sha256@libssh.org'` was selected:\n\n```erlang\n5> ssh:connection_info(C, algorithms).\n{algorithms,[{kex,'curve25519-sha256@libssh.org'},\n             {hkey,'ssh-rsa'},\n             {send_mac,'hmac-sha1'},\n             {recv_mac,'hmac-sha1'},\n             {encrypt,'aes192-ctr'},\n             {decrypt,'aes192-ctr'},\n             {compress,none},\n             {decompress,none},\n             {send_ext_info,false},\n             {recv_ext_info,true}]}\n```\n\n#### Example of modify_algorithms handling\n\nWe will now check if the\n[modify_algorithms](`t:ssh:modify_algorithms_common_option/0`) on a lower level\nis applied to a\n[preferred_algorithms](`t:ssh:preferred_algorithms_common_option/0`) on a higher\nlevel. We will do that by enabling the `ssh-dss` algorithm that is supported,\nbut not in the default set.\n\nThe config file `ex3.config` has the contents:\n\n```erlang\n[\n {ssh, [{modify_algorithms,\n         [ {prepend, [{public_key, ['ssh-dss']}]} ]\n        }]}\n].\n```\n\nA newly started erlang shell shows that no `'ssh-dss'` is present in the\n`public_key` entry:\n\n```erlang\n1> proplists:get_value(public_key, ssh:default_algorithms()).\n['ecdsa-sha2-nistp384','ecdsa-sha2-nistp521',\n 'ecdsa-sha2-nistp256','ssh-ed25519','ssh-ed448',\n 'rsa-sha2-256','rsa-sha2-512','ssh-rsa']\n2>\n```\n\nA call to `ssh:connect/3` removes all algorithms but one of each type:\n\n```erlang\n2> ssh:start().\nok\n3> {ok,C} = ssh:connect(loopback, 22,\n                        [{preferred_algorithms,\n                         [{public_key, ['ecdsa-sha2-nistp256']},\n\t\t\t  {kex, ['ecdh-sha2-nistp256']},\n\t\t          {cipher, ['chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com']},\n\t\t\t  {mac, ['hmac-sha2-256']},\n\t\t\t  {compression, [none]}\n\t\t\t  ]}\n\t\t\t ]).\n{ok,<0.101.0>}\n4> ssh:connection_info(C,algorithms).\n{algorithms,[{kex,'ecdh-sha2-nistp256'},\n             {hkey,'ssh-dss'},\n             {send_mac,'chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com'},\n             {recv_mac,'chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com'},\n             {encrypt,'chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com'},\n             {decrypt,'chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com'},\n             {compress,none},\n             {decompress,none},\n             {send_ext_info,false},\n             {recv_ext_info,true}]}\n5>\n```\n\nBut `'ssh-dss'` is selected although the call inserted _only_\n`'ecdsa-sha2-nistp256'` as acceptable.\n\nThis example showed that we could augment the set of algorithms with a\nconfig-file without the need to change the actual call.\n\nFor demonstration purposes we used `prepend` instead of `append`. This forces\nthe negotiation to select `ssh-dss` since the the full list of public key\nalgorithms was `['ssh-dss','ecdsa-sha2-nistp256']`. Normally it is safer to\nappend a non-default algorithm.","ref":"configurations.html#algorithm-configuration"},{"type":"extras","title":"Configuring algorithms in SSH","doc":"<!--\n%CopyrightBegin%\n\nSPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0\n\nCopyright Ericsson AB 2023-2025.

See [RFC 4253](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253), \"The Secure\nShell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol\" for details.\n\nThe negotiation is simple: both peers sends their list of supported alghorithms\nto the other part. The first algorithm on the client's list that also in on the\nserver's list is selected. So it is the client's ordering of the list that\ngives the priority for the algorithms.\n\nThere are five lists exchanged in the connection setup. Three of them are also\ndivided in two directions, to and from the server.\n\nThe lists are (named as in the SSH application's options):\n\n- **`kex`** - Key exchange\n\n  An algorithm is selected for computing a secret encryption key. Among examples\n  are: the old nowadays week `'diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1'` and the very\n  strong and modern `'ecdh-sha2-nistp512'`.\n\n- **`public_key`** - Server host key\n\n  The asymmetric encryption algorithm used in the server's private-public host\n  key pair. Examples include the well-known RSA `'ssh-rsa'` and elliptic curve\n  `'ecdsa-sha2-nistp521'`.\n\n- **`cipher`** - Symmetric cipher algorithm used for the payload encryption.\n  This algorithm will use the key calculated in the kex phase (together with\n  other info) to generate the actual key used. Examples are tripple-DES\n  `'3des-cbc'` and one of many AES variants `'aes192-ctr'`.\n\n  This list is actually two - one for each direction server-to-client and\n  client-to-server. Therefore it is possible but rare to have different\n  algorithms in the two directions in one connection.\n\n- **`mac`** - Message authentication code\n\n  \"Check sum\" of each message sent between the peers. Examples are SHA\n  `'hmac-sha1'` and SHA2 `'hmac-sha2-512'`.\n\n  This list is also divided into two for the both directions\n\n- **`compression`** - If and how to compress the message.

In the User's Guide the chapter\n[Configuring algorithms in SSH](configure_algos.md) describes the options for\nenabling or disabling algorithms -\n[preferred_algorithms](`t:ssh:preferred_algorithms_common_option/0`) and\n[modify_algorithms](`t:ssh:modify_algorithms_common_option/0`).","ref":"hardening.html#algorithm-selection"},{"type":"extras","title":"Re-keying - Hardening","doc":"In the setup of the SSH connection a secret cipher key is generated by\nco-operation of the client and the server. Keeping this key secret is crucial\nfor keeping the communication secret. As time passes and encrypted messages are\nexchanged, the probability that a listener could guess that key increases.\n\nThe SSH protocol therefore has a special operation defined - _key\nre-negotiation_ or _re-keying_. Any side (client or server) could initiate the\nre-keying and the result is a new cipher key. The result is that the\neves-dropper has to restart its evil and dirty craftmanship.\n\nSee the option [rekey_limit](`t:ssh:rekey_limit_common_option/0`) for a\ndescription.","ref":"hardening.html#re-keying"},{"type":"extras","title":"Hardening of the SSH protocol - both daemons and clients - Hardening","doc":"","ref":"hardening.html#hardening-of-the-ssh-protocol-both-daemons-and-clients"},{"type":"extras","title":"Disabling shell and exec in a daemon - Hardening","doc":"A daemon has two services for evaluating tasks on behalf of a remote client.

The\noptions [exec](`t:ssh:exec_daemon_option/0`) and\n[shell](`t:ssh:shell_daemon_option/0`) are enabled per default but could be set\nto `disabled` if not needed.
