This makes the Windows Erlang terminal experience identical to that of Unix.\n\nThe re-write brings with it a number of bug fixes and feature additions:\n\n-- The TTY is now reset when Erlang exits, fixing zsh to not break when terminating an Erlang session.\n\n-- standard_error now uses the same unicode mode as standard_io.\n\n-- Hitting backspace when searching the shell history with an empty search string no longer breaks the shell.\n\n-- Tab expansion now works on remote nodes started using the JCL interface.\n\n-- It is now possible to configure the shell slogan and the session slogans (that is the texts that appear when you start an Erlang shell). See the kernel documentation for more details.\n\n-- Added shell:start_interactive for starting the interactive shell from a non-interactive Erlang session (for example an escript).\n\n-- On Windows, when starting in detached mode the standard handler are now set to nul devices instead of being unset.\n\n-- Standard I/O now always defaults to unicode mode if supported.

This makes the Windows Erlang terminal experience identical to that of Unix.\n\nThe re-write brings with it a number of bug fixes and feature additions:\n\n-- The TTY is now reset when Erlang exits, fixing zsh to not break when terminating an Erlang session.\n\n-- standard_error now uses the same unicode mode as standard_io.\n\n-- Hitting backspace when searching the shell history with an empty search string no longer breaks the shell.\n\n-- Tab expansion now works on remote nodes started using the JCL interface.\n\n-- It is now possible to configure the shell slogan and the session slogans (that is the texts that appear when you start an Erlang shell). See the kernel documentation for more details.\n\n-- Added shell:start_interactive for starting the interactive shell from a non-interactive Erlang session (for example an escript).\n\n-- On Windows, when starting in detached mode the standard handler are now set to nul devices instead of being unset.\n\n-- Standard I/O now always defaults to unicode mode if supported. Previously the default was latin1 if the runtime system had been started with -oldshell or -noshell (for example in an escript). To send raw bytes over standard out, one now explicitly has to specify io:setopts(standard_io, [{encoding, latin1}]).\n\n"
