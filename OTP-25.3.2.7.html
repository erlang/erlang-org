        release_note: "If the external term format encoding of an argument list part of a distributed spawn operation was faulty, the newly spawned remote process could misbehave. The misbehavior included hanging or interpret an incoming message as an argument list to use. This was very unlikely to happen unless using an alternate implementation of the distribution protocol which made a faulty encoding of the argument list. The child process will now detect this error and terminate before executing the user specified code.\n\n"

        release_note: "On Apple Silicon Macs running macOS Sonoma, the runtime system with the JIT enabled would crash. Therefore, the configure script will by default now disable the JIT on Macs with Apple Silicon. When building for earlier versions of macOS, the JIT can be explicitly enabled by passing --enable-jit to the configure script.\n\n"

        release_note: "Fix bugs where if the body of a matchspec would return a map with a variable ('$1', '$_' etc) as one of the keys or values and the variable was not an immidiate, the term would not be copied to the receiving processes heap. This would later corrupt the term in the table as the GC could place move markers in it, which in turn would cause the VM to crash.\n\nBug has been present for since OTP 17.0.\n\n"
