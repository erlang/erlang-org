        release_note: "The call `gen_tcp:send/2` could hang indefinitely despite having set the\n`send_timeout` option for the following unfortunate combination of\ncircumstances:\n\n- The socket has to be in passive mode.\n- All output buffers had to be filled util the `high_watermark` was hit,\n  causing the `gen_tcp:send/2` operation to block.\n- While the send operation was blocked, a `gen_tcp:recv/2,3` call had to be\n  done from a different process. It had to block, waiting for data for a while\n  before completing the operation, and the received packet had to fill at\n  least 75% of the receive buffer.\n\nUnder these circumstances he information that a send operation was waiting got\nlost, so the send operation that blocked in the first placed would never\nreturn. The data it had would be sent, though, and send operations from other\nprocesses, still work.\n\nThis bug has been fixed."
