        release_note: "Fixed bug in erlang:list_to_ref/1 when called with a reference created by a remote note. Function list_to_ref/1 is intended for debugging and not to be used in application programs. Bug exist since OTP 20.0.\n\n"

This bug has existed since ERTS version 5.5.2 (OTP R11).\n\nThis bug was also unknowingly fixed in ERTS version 10.0 (OTP 21.0) due to a new ERTS internal implementation of signaling between processes.\n\n"
