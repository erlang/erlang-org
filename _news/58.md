 FlowForwarding.org has announced the availability of LINC, an Erlang based open source soft switch implementing the 1.2 version of the OpenFlow standard. The LINC switch has now been released as commercial friendly open source through the FlowForwarding.org community website, encouraging users and vendors to use LINC and contribute to its development. The initial LINC implementation focuses on correctness and feature compliance. Through an abstraction layer, specialized network hardware drivers can be easily interfaced to LINC. It has been implemented by using the power and flexibility of the Erlang programming language and software environment. Erlang allows for rapid industrial strength implementations, a key requirement for developing and deploying an evolving technology such as OpenFlow.
