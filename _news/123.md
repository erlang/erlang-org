# OTP 21

Erlang/OTP 21 is a new major release with new features, improvements as well as incompatibilities.

## Potential Incompatibilities
* All Corba applications are now moved from the OTP repository
* A new Corba repository will be created https://github.com/erlang
* New applications ftp and tftp, moved from inets
* ssl no longer supports 3_DES cipher suites or RSA-key exchange cipher suites by default
* erlang:monitor on a primitive node (erl_interface, jinterface, etc) will no longer fail with badarg exception. Instead a monitor will be created, but it will only supervise the connection to the node.

##  Highlights

###  Erts:
* Enhanced IO scalability
* Support for usage of distribution controller processes for alternative transports, routing etc
* compact instructions on 64bit systems for code below 4GB 20% less memory for loaded code
* Rewrite of the efile-driver with NIFs and "Dirty schedulers" resulting in faster file operations
* non-smp VM removed
* link and monitor optimized for scalability
* os:getenv/putenv now work on thread-safe emulation. No longer in sync with libc getenv(3). Manual synchronization will be needed.

### Compiler:
* Misc compiler optimizations including contributions from the Elixir team resulting in 10% improvements in benchmarks
* "Tuple calls" have been removed from the run-time system.
* Code such as `f({ok, Val}) -> {ok, Val}` is now automatically rewritten to `f({ok, Val} = Tuple) -> Tuple.` this reduces code size, execution time, and removed GC pressure.
* More information in stacktrace from a number of operators
* `erlang:get_stacktrace/0` deprecated to be replaced with `try ... catch C:R:Stacktrace -> ...`
* Creation of small maps with literal keys optimized.
* A new predefined macro ``OTP_RELEASE`` and preprocessor directives ``-if`` and ``-elif``

### Security:
* DTLS is now supported in the SSL application
* Enhanced support for distribution over TLS
* "unsecure" ciphers removed from defaults in SSL and SSH.
* A new option value defined to facilitate implementing exec servers. Old option kept for compatibility, but now gives errors on stderror.

### Standard libraries:
* New API for logging, logger
* New uri_string module for parsing URIs according to "The standard"
* New function lists:search(list,fun/1) -> {ok, Value} | false
* Changed default behaviour of .erlang loading. escript, erlc, dialyzer and typer no longer load an .erlang at all.
