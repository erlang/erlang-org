## OTP 25.3

Erlang/OTP 25.3 is the third and final maintenance patch package for OTP 25, with mostly bug fixes as well as improvements.

Below are some highlights of the release:

### Highlight:

Support for fully asynchronous distributed signaling
where send operations *never* block. This functionality
is by default disabled and can be enabled per process.
For more information see the documentation of
process_flag(async_dist, Bool).



The Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository,
