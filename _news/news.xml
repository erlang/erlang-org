    <title>OTP 23.2 Release</title>
    <lead>The second maintenance patch package for OTP 23</lead>
    <twitter-status>OTP-23.2 has been released</twitter-status>
    <content><div class="markdown-body"> <p>Erlang/OTP 23.2 is the second maintenance patch release for OTP 23, with mostly bug fixes as well as a few improvements.</p> <p>A few of the changes and highlights are:</p> <h3>SSL</h3> <p>Handle extraneous certs in certificate chains as well as chains that are incomplete but can be reconstructed or unordered chains. The cert and certfile options will now accept a list of certificates so that the user may specify the chain explicitly.</p> <h3>Potential incompatibility</h3> <h4>stdlib</h4> <p>Improved the API and documentation of the uri_string module. Added a new chapter to the Users Guide about Uniform Resource Identifiers and their handling with the new API. Added two new API functions: uri_string:allowed_characters/0 and uri_string:percent_decode/1.</p> <p>This change has been marked as potentially incompatible as uri_string:normalize/2 used to decode percent-encoded character triplets that corresponded to characters not in the reserved set. After this change, uri_string:normalize/2 will only decode those percent-encoded triplets that correspond to characters in the unreserved set (ALPHA / DIGIT / &quot;-&quot; / &quot;.&quot; / &quot;_&quot; / &quot;~&quot;).</p> <p>A full list of bug fixes and improvements in the <a href="https://erlang.org/download/OTP-23.2.README" rel="nofollow">readme</a>.</p> <h4>Download and documentation</h4> <p>Online documentation can be browsed here:<br /> <a href="https://erlang.org/documentation/doc-11.1.4/doc" rel="nofollow">https://erlang.org/documentation/doc-11.1.4/doc</a></p> <p>Pre-built versions for Windows can be fetched here:<br /> <a href="https://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_23.2.exe" rel="nofollow">https://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_23.2.exe</a><br /> <a href="https://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_23.2.exe" rel="nofollow">https://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_23.2.exe</a></p> <p>The Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository:<br /> <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp">https://github.com/erlang/otp</a></p> </div> </content>

It was also introduced in OTP 23.0 and corrected in OTP 23.1 The vulnerability is registered as CVE-2020-25623.<br /> The vulnerability is only exposed if the http server (httpd) in the inets application is used. The vulnerability makes it possible to read arbitrary files which the Erlang system has read access to with for example a specially prepared http request.</p> <h3>General build issues</h3> <p>Adjust /bin/sh to /system/bin/sh in scripts when installing on Android.<br /> Changes in build system to make it build for macOS 11.0 with Apple Silicon. Also corrected execution of match specs to work on Apple Silicon.</p> <h3>Full list of bug fixes and improvements in the readme.</h3> <p><a href="http://erlang.org/download/OTP-23.1.README" rel="nofollow">http://erlang.org/download/OTP-23.1.README</a></p> <h4>Download and doc</h4> <p>Pre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:<br /> <a href="http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_23.1.exe" rel="nofollow">http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_23.1.exe</a><br /> <a href="http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_23.1.exe" rel="nofollow">http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_23.1.exe</a></p> <p>Online documentation can be browsed here:<br /> <a href="http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-11.1/doc" rel="nofollow">http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-11.1/doc</a><br /> The Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository,<br /> <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp">https://github.com/erlang/otp</a></p> </div> </content>

    <title>Erlang OTP 23.0 Release Candidate 1</title>
    <lead>First release candidate is now available for testing!</lead>
    <twitter-status/>
    <content><div class="markdown-body"> <h2>OTP 23 Release Candidate 1</h2> <p>This is the first of three planned release candidates before the OTP 23 release.<br /> The intention with this release is to get feedback from our users. <strong>All feedback is welcome</strong>, even if it is only to say that it works for you.</p> <p>Erlang/OTP 23 is a new major release with new features, improvements as well as a few incompatibilities.</p> <h3>Potential Incompatibilities</h3> <ul> <li>SSL: <ul> <li>Support for SSL 3.0 is completely removed.</li> <li>TLS 1.3 is added to the list of default supported versions.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>erl_interface</code>: Removed the deprecated parts of <code>erl_interface</code><br /> (<code>erl_interface.h</code> and essentially all C functions with prefix <code>erl_</code>).</li> <li>The deprecated <code>erlang:get_stacktrace/0</code> BIF now returns an empty list instead of a stacktrace.<br /> <code>erlang:get_stacktrace/0</code> is scheduled for removal in OTP 24.</li> <li>...</li> </ul> <h3>Highlights</h3> <ul> <li>A new module <code>erpc</code> in kernel which implements an enhanced subset of the operations provided by the <code>rpc</code> module. Enhanced in the sense that it makes it possible to distinguish between returned value, raised exceptions and other errors. <code>erpc</code> also has better performance and scalability than the original <code>rpc</code> implementation. This by utilizing the newly introduced <code>spawn_request()</code> BIF. Also the <code>rpc</code> module benefits from these improvements by utilizing <code>erpc</code> when possible.</li> <li>Scalability and performance Improvements plus new functionality regarding distributed spawn operations.</li> <li>In binary matching, the size of the segment to be matched is now allowed to be a guard expression (EEP-52)</li> <li>When matching with maps the keys can now be guard expressions (EEP-52).</li> <li>ssh: support for TCP/IP port forwarding, a.k.a tunneling a.k.a as tcp-forward/direct-tcp is implemented. In the OpenSSH client, this corresponds to the options -L and -R.</li> <li>Allow underscores in numeric literals to improve readability. Examples: <code>123_456_789</code>, <code>16#1234_ABCD</code>.</li> <li>New functions in the shell for displaying documentation for Erlang modules, functions and types. The<br /> functions are: <ul> <li><code>h/1,2,3</code> -- Print the documentation for a <code>Module:Function/Arity</code>.</li> <li><code>ht/1,2,3</code> -- Print the type documentation for a <code>Module:Type/Arity</code>.<br /> The embedded documentation is created as docchunks (EEP 48) when building the Erlang/OTP documentation.</li> </ul> </li> <li>kernel: The module <code>pg</code> with a new implementation of distributed named process groups is introduced. The old module <code>pg2</code> is deprecated and scheduled for removal in OTP 24.</li> <li>Our tool chain for building the Windows packages is upgraded with new C++ compiler, Java compiler, OpenSSL libraries and wxWidgets versions. We are now using WSL (the Linux Subsystem for Windows when building) which makes it easier to handle the build environment.</li> <li>...</li> </ul> <p>For more details see<br /> <a href="http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_23.0-rc1.readme" rel="nofollow">http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_23.0-rc1.readme</a></p> <p>Pre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:<br /> <a href="http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_23.0-rc1.exe" rel="nofollow">http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_23.0-rc1.exe</a><br /> <a href="http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_23.0-rc1.exe" rel="nofollow">http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_23.0-rc1.exe</a></p> <p>Online documentation can be browsed here:<br /> <a href="http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-11.0-rc1/doc" rel="nofollow">http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-11.0-rc1/doc</a><br /> The Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository,<br /> <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp">https://github.com/erlang/otp</a></p> </div> </content>

    <title>Erlang OTP 22.1 is released</title>
    <lead>Erlang/OTP 22.1 is the first service release for the 22 major release with new features, improvements as well as bugfixes</lead>
    <twitter-status/>
    <content><h2>Potential Incompatibilities</h2> <ul> <li>Mnesia: Transactions with sticky locks could with async_asym transactions be committed in the wrong order, since asym transactions are spawned on the remote nodes. To fix this bug the communication protocol between mnesia nodes had to be updated, thus mnesia will no longer be able to connect to nodes earlier than mnesia-4.14 ,first realeased in OTP-19.0.</li> <li>Stdlib: Debugging of time-outs in gen_statem has been improved. Starting a time-out is now logged in sys:log and sys:trace. Running time-outs are visible in server crash logs, and with sys:get_status. Due to this system events {start_timer, Action, State} and {insert_timout, Event, State} have been added, which may surprise tools that rely on the format of these events. New features: The EventContent of a running time-out can be updated with {TimeoutType, update, NewEventContent}. Running time-outs can be cancelled with {TimeoutType, cancel} which is more readable than using Time = infinity.<span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">{rel, Name, Vsn, RelApps, Opts}</span>.</li> </ul> <h2>Highlights</h2> <h3>Compiler:</h3> <ul> <li>erlc can now automatically use a compile server to avoid starting an Erlang system for each file to be compiled in a multi-file project. See the documentation for how to enable it.</li> </ul> <h3>Standard libraries:</h3> <ul> <li>SSL: Basic support for TLS 1.3 Client for experimental use. For more information see the Standards Compliance chapter of the User&#39;s Guide.</li> <li>crypto: The Message Authentication Codes (MAC) CMAC, HMAC and Poly1305 are unified into common functions in the New Crypto API. See the manual for CRYPTO.<span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;"> cipher_info/1</span>&nbsp;functions returns maps with information about the hash or cipher in the argument.</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>For more details see<br /> <a href="http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.1.readme">http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.1.readme</a></p> <p>Pre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:<br /> <a href="http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_22.1.exe">http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_22.1.exe</a><br /> <a href="http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_22.1.exe">http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_22.1.exe</a></p> <p>Online documentation can be browsed here:<br /> <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/search/">http://erlang.org/doc/search/</a></p> <p>The source tarball can be fetched here:<br /> <a href="http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.1.tar.gz" rel="nofollow">http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.1.tar.gz</a><br /> The documentation can be fetched here:<br /> <a href="http://erlang.org/download/otp_doc_html_22.1.tar.gz" rel="nofollow">http://erlang.org/download/otp_doc_html_22.1.tar.gz</a><br /> The man pages can be fetched here:<br /> <a href="http://erlang.org/download/otp_doc_man_22.1.tar.gz" rel="nofollow">http://erlang.org/download/otp_doc_man_22.1.tar.gz</a></p> <p>The Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp">https://github.com/erlang/otp</a></p> <p><a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-22.1">OTP-22.1</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Thank you for all your contributions!</p> </content>

The increase in speed will vary depending on the type of code being cover-compiled, as an example&nbsp;the compiler test suite runs more than twice as fast with the new Cover.</li> <li>SSL now uses the new logger API, including log levels and verbose debug logging.</li> </ul> <p>For more details see<br /> <a href="http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.0-rc1.readme">http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.0-rc1.readme</a></p> <p>Pre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:<br /> <a href="http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_22.0-rc1.exe">http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_22.0-rc1.exe</a><br /> <a href="http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_22.0-rc1.exe">http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_22.0-rc1.exe</a></p> <p>Online documentation can be browsed here:<br /> <a href="http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-11.0-rc1/doc">http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-11.0-rc1/doc</a></p> <p>The Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp">https://github.com/erlang/otp</a></p> <p><a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-22.0-rc1">OTP-22.0-rc1</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Thank you for all your contributions!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </content>

This is now changed so that only atoms actually containing unicode characters are encoded with the UTF8 tags while other atoms are encoded <code>ATOM_EXT</code> just as before.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Here are some of the most important news in OTP 20:</p> <h2>Potential Incompatibilities</h2> <ul> <li> <p>ERTS:</p> <ul> <li>The non SMP Erlang VM is deprecated and not built by default</li> <li>Remove deprecated <code>erlang:hash/2</code></li> <li>erlang:statistics/1 with scheduler_wall_time now also includes info about dirty CPU schedulers.</li> <li>The new purge strategy introduced in OTP 19.1 is mandatory and slightly incompatible for processes holding funs<br /> see <code>erlang:check_process_code/3</code>.</li> <li>The NIF library reload is not supported anymore.</li> <li>Atoms can now contain arbitrary unicode characters which means that the <code>DFLAG_UTF8_ATOMS</code> capability in the distribution protocol must be supported if an OTP 20 node should accept the connection with another node or library. Third party libraries which uses the distribution protocol need to be updated with this.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Asn1: Deprecated module and functions removed (<code>asn1rt</code>, <code>asn1ct:encode/3</code> and <code>decode/3</code>)</p> </li> <li> <p>Ssh: client only option in a call to start a daemon will now fail</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Highlights</h2> <h3>Erts:</h3> <ul> <li>Dirty schedulers enabled and supported on VM with SMP support.</li> <li>support for &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; BIFs and &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; GC.</li> <li>erlang:garbage_collect/2 for control of minor or major GC</li> <li>Erlang literals are no longer copied when sending messages.</li> <li>Improved performance for large ETS tables, &gt;256 entries (except ordered_set)</li> <li>erlang:system_info/1 atom_count and atom_limit</li> <li>Reduced memory pressure by converting sub-binaries to heap-binaries during GC</li> <li>enif_select, map an external event to message</li> <li>Improvements of timers internally in the VM resulting in reduced memory consumption and more efficient administration for timers</li> </ul> <h3>Compiler:</h3> <ul> <li>Code generation for complicated guards is improved.</li> <li>Warnings for repeated identical map keys. <code>#{&#39;a&#39;=&gt;1, &#39;b&#39;=&gt;2, &#39;a&#39;=&gt;3}</code> will warn for the repeated key <code>a</code>.</li> <li>By default there is now a warning when <code>export_all</code> is used.

    <title>Erlang/OTP 19.3 has been released</title>
    <lead>Erlang/OTP 19.3 is the third service release for the 19 release track</lead>
    <twitter-status>Erlang/OTP 19.3 has been released</twitter-status>
    <content><p>Some highlights for 19.3</p> <ul> <li><strong>crypto, ssh</strong>: The implementation of the key exchange algorithms diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha* are optimized, up to a factor of 11 for the slowest ( = biggest and safest) group size.</li> <li><strong>dialyzer</strong>: The peak memory consumption is reduced.<br /> Analyzing modules with binary construction with huge strings is now much faster.</li> <li><strong>erts</strong>: A received SIGTERM signal to beam will generate a &#39;stop&#39; message to the init process and terminate the Erlang VM nicely. This is equivalent to calling init:stop/0.</li> <li><strong>kernel</strong>: The functions in the &#39;file&#39; module that take a list of paths (e.g. file:path_consult/2) will now continue to search in the path if the path contains something that is not a directory.<br /> Two OTP processes that are known to receive many messages are &#39;rex&#39; (used by &#39;rpc&#39;) and &#39;error_logger&#39;. Those processes will now store unprocessed messages outside the process heap, this will improve their capability to handle large message queues.</li> <li><strong>public_key:</strong> New function pkix_verify_hostname/2,3 Implements certificate hostname checking. See the manual and RFC 6125.</li> <li><strong>public_key, ssh</strong>: The ssh host key fingerprint generation now also takes a list of algorithms and returns a list of corresponding fingerprints. See public_key:ssh_hostkey_fingerprint/2 and the option silently_accept_hosts in ssh:connect.</li> <li><strong>ssl</strong>: Move PEM cache to a dedicated process, to avoid making the SSL manager process a bottleneck. This improves scalability of TLS connections.</li> <li><strong>stdlib</strong>: filename:safe_relative_path/1 to sanitize a relative path has been added.</li> <li>Thanks to more than 20 different contributors</li> </ul> <p>You can find the README and the full listing of changes for this service release at<br /> <a href="http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_19.3.readme">http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_19.3.readme</a><br /> The Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository,<br /> <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp">https://github.com/erlang/otp</a> with tag OTP-19.3</p> <p>Please report any new issues via Erlang/OTPs public issue tracker</p> <p><a href="https://bugs.erlang.org">https://bugs.erlang.org</a><br /> <br /> We want to thank all of those who sent us patches, suggestions and bug reports!</p> <p>Thank you!</p> <p>The Erlang/OTP Team at Ericsson</p> </content>

    <title>Erlang/OTP 19.2 has been released</title>
    <lead>Erlang/OTP 19.2 is the second service release for the 19 release track.</lead>
    <twitter-status>Erlang/OTP 19.2 has been released</twitter-status>
    <content><p>Some highlights for 19.2</p> <ul> <li>STDLIB: The new behaviour gen_statem has been improved with 3 new&nbsp;features: the possibility to use old style non-proxy timeouts&nbsp;for gen_statem:call/2,3, state entry code, and state timeouts. These are backwards compatible. Minor code and&nbsp;documentation improvements has been performed including a&nbsp;borderline semantics correction of timeout zero handling.</li> <li>SSL: Experimental version of DTLS. It is runnable but not complete&nbsp;and cannot be considered reliable for production usage. To use&nbsp;DTLS add the option {protocol, dtls} to ssl:connect and ssl:listen.</li> <li>SSH: Extended the option silently_accept_hosts for ssh:connect to&nbsp;make it possible for the client to check the SSH host key&nbsp;fingerprint string. Se the reference manual for SSH.</li> <li>~40 contributions since the previous service release OTP 19.1</li> </ul> <p>You can find the README and the full listing of changes for this service release at</p> <p>&nbsp; http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_19.2.readme<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> The source distribution and binary distributions for Windows can be<br /> downloaded from</p> <p>&nbsp; http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_19.2.tar.gz<br /> &nbsp; http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_win32_19.2.exe<br /> &nbsp; http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_win64_19.2.exe<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Note: To unpack the TAR archive you need a GNU TAR compatible program.</p> <p>For installation instructions please consult the README file that is part&nbsp;of the distribution.</p> <p>The Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang<br /> repository, https://github.com/erlang/otp with tag OTP-19.2</p> <p>The on-line documentation can be found at: http://www.erlang.org/doc/<br /> You can also download the complete HTML documentation or the Unix manual files</p> <p>&nbsp; http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_doc_html_19.2.tar.gz<br /> &nbsp; http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_doc_man_19.2.tar.gz<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Please report any new issues via Erlang/OTPs public issue tracker&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;https://bugs.erlang.org<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> We want to thank all of those who sent us patches, suggestions and bug reports!</p> <p>Thank you!</p> <p>The Erlang/OTP Team at Ericsson</p> </content>

Later, a separate organisation was created within Ericsson - the OTP unit. Its aim was to commercialise and stabilise the implementation of Erlang, its libraries, tools and documentation.

Erlang/OTP was released as open source to encourage innovation and to spread the use of Erlang. The Open Source release was thus well tested and stable.</span></p> <p class="p2" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;"><span class="s1" style="box-sizing: border-box;"><b style="box-sizing: border-box;">What has happened during the 17 years?</b></span></p> <p class="p1" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;"><span class="s1" style="box-sizing: border-box;">&quot;Looking back, it was a beneficial decision for both Ericsson and the Open Source community,&rdquo; says Kenneth Lundin, head of Erlang/OTP, who is one of the original staff members.</span></p> <p class="p1" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;"><span class="s1" style="box-sizing: border-box;">The characteristics of Erlang and OTP - fault tolerance, massive concurrency, scalable distribution and ease of software development - have found applications in many other innovative areas. In the mid 2000s, the introduction of support for multicore (Symmetric multiprocessing, SMP) gave Erlang/OTP a major boost in popularity.&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="p1" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;"><span class="s1" style="box-sizing: border-box;">We are now seeing products developed in applications as diverse as banking, network supervision, gaming, cloud services, databases, messaging and Internet of Things to name but a few.</span></p> <p class="p3" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="p4" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;"><span class="s1" style="box-sizing: border-box;"><b style="box-sizing: border-box;">Where is Erlang going?</b></span></p> <p class="p4" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;"><span class="s1" style="box-sizing: border-box;">Erlang and OTP nowadays witness an increasing popularity across industries, used by companies such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Bet365 and Machine Zone. &quot;It is exciting to see that what started as a small project an a software research laboratory has grown into the basis of commercial successes around the world,&rdquo; says Mike Williams, one of the co-inventors.</span></p> <p class="p4" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;">In 2015, Erlang/OTP 18.0 was released under a less restrictive and OSI-approved Apache License 2.0. Behind the license change was the Industrial Erlang User Group, a group of enterprise users of Erlang/OTP collaborating with Ericsson in securing the future health, well being and commercial success of the Erlang outside of Ericsson.</p> <p class="p4" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="p4" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;">Bruce Yinhe</p> <p class="p4" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;">community-manager@erlang.org</p> </content>

    <title>Announcing Erlang Issue Tracker bugs.erlang.org</title>
    <lead>We are happy to announce the issue tracker for Erlang/OTP (http://bugs.erlang.org). It allows you to report bugs, suggest improvements and new features.</lead>

    <content><div style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;">We are happy to announce the issue tracker for Erlang/OTP (http://bugs.erlang.org). Our intention is that the issue tracker replaces the erlang-bugs mailing list, in order to make it easier for the community to report bugs, suggest improvements and new features. You can start using the issue tracker today.</div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;">&nbsp;</div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;">The issue tracker for Erlang/OTP is a step towards improving and formalising the process of community contributions, a goal which is actively worked on by the Industrial Erlang User Group. The IEUG is working with Ericsson to improve libraries, tool chains, middle-ware and contributions while spreading awareness and increasing user adoption.</div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;">&nbsp;</div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">FAQ</strong></div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;">&nbsp;</div> <div style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">1.

This includes a new API for&nbsp;<br style="box-sizing: border-box;" /> time, as well as &quot;time warp&quot; modes which alters the behavior when system time changes. You are strongly encouraged to use the new API instead of the old API based on&nbsp;<span style="box-sizing: border-box;">erlang</span>:now/0.&nbsp;<span style="box-sizing: border-box;">erlang</span>:now/0 has been deprecated since it is a scalability bottleneck.&nbsp;<br style="box-sizing: border-box;" /> For more information see the Time and Time Correction chapter of the ERTS User&#39;s Guide.

    <title>R15B01 released</title>
    <lead>Erlang/OTP R15B01 has been released </lead>
    <twitter-status/>
    <content><p> Erlang/OTP R15B01 has been released ahead of schedule on April 3:rd. It is the first service release.</p> <p> <br /> See the release notes in the <a href="http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_R15B01.readme">Read me</a></p> <p> Download the new release from the <a href="http://www.erlang.org/download.html">Downloads page</a></p> <p> <strong>Highlights:<br /> </strong></p> <p> &nbsp;</p> <ul> <li> Added erlang:statistics(scheduler_wall_time) to ensure correct determination of scheduler utilization. Measuring scheduler utilization is strongly preferred over CPU utilization, since CPU utilization gives very poor indications of actual scheduler/vm usage.</li> <li> Changed ssh implementation to use the public_key application for all public key handling. This is also a first step for enabling a callback API for supplying public keys and handling keys protected with password phrases. Additionally the test suites where improved so that they do not copy the users keys to test server directories as this is a security liability. Also ipv6 and file access issues found in the process has been fixed.</li> <li> When an escript ends now all printout to standard output and standard error gets out on the terminal. This bug has been corrected by changing the behaviour of erlang:halt/0,1, which should fix the same problem for other escript-like applications, i.e. that data stored in the output port driver buffers got lost when printing on a TTY and exiting through erlang:halt/0,1. The BIF:s erlang:halt/0,1 has gotten improved semantics and there is a new BIF erlang:halt/2 to accomplish something like the old semantics. See the documentation.</li> <li> The DTrace source patch from Scott Lystig Fritchie is integrated in the source tree. Using an emulator with dtrace probe is still not supported for production use, but may be a valuable debugging tool. Configure with --with-dynamic-trace=dtrace (or --with-dynamic-trace=systemtap) to create a build with dtrace probes enabled. See runtime_tools for documentation and examples</li> <li> Added Torbjörn Törnkvists LDAP client as a new application called eldap.</li> <li> Added options for the ssh client to support user keys files that are password protected.</li> </ul> </content>

    <title>LINC switch opensourced</title>
    <lead>FlowForwarding.org announces LINC, the free, Erlang based industry supported, OpenFlow soft-switch supporting OpenFlow 1.2! </lead>
    <twitter-status/>
    <content><p> FlowForwarding.org has announced the availability of LINC, an Erlang based open source soft switch implementing the 1.2 version of the OpenFlow standard. The LINC switch has now been released as commercial friendly open source through the FlowForwarding.org community website, encouraging users and vendors to use LINC and contribute to its development. The initial LINC implementation focuses on correctness and feature compliance. Through an abstraction layer, specialized network hardware drivers can be easily interfaced to LINC. It has been implemented by using the power and flexibility of the Erlang programming language and software environment. Erlang allows for rapid industrial strength implementations, a key requirement for developing and deploying an evolving technology such as OpenFlow.

    <content><div style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"> To encourage a welcoming, inclusive climate for communication within the erlang.org community, the Erlang/OTP team, together with members of the community, has released a new code of conduct, available at <a href="http://www.erlang.org/download/erlang_org_code_of_conduct.txt">http://www.erlang.org/download/erlang_org_code_of_conduct.txt</a>. This code of conduct lays out a guideline of how to communicate within the erlang.org community in a way we hope is easy to read, help mutual understanding and avoid flames. The erlang.org community is by definition all communication in or around erlang.org, including but not limited to the erlang.org mailing lists or Github discussions.</div> <div style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"> &nbsp;</div> <div style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"> This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.</div> <div style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"> &nbsp;</div> <div style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"> <a href="http://www.erlang.org/download/erlang_org_code_of_conduct.txt">http://www.erlang.org/download/erlang_org_code_of_conduct.txt</a></div></content>

    <content><h2> Erlang/OTP 18.0-rc1 is available for testing.</h2> <p> &nbsp;</p> <p> This is an alpha release, which will be followed by a planned beta release in May and a final OTP 18.0 product release in June 2015.</p> <p> Between the alpha and beta and final release there will be new updates of the master branch with corrections and minor new features. Occasionally there might be new tags which we in that case will communicate and ask you to test.</p> <p> Erlang/OTP 18.0 is a new major release with new features, quite a few (characteristics) improvements, as well as a few incompatibilities.&nbsp;</p> <p> See the Release Notes and the documentation for more details.</p> <p> We would like to ask you to build and test the alpha release and send us your feedback as soon as possible, so that we can make the necessary corrections before OTP 18.0-rc2 and OTP 18.0, respectively.</p> <p> The release contains many changes; thus, some unexpected incompatibilities or issues may have slipped through our tests. Please try to build and run your current products/applications and let us know about any problems.</p> <p> <strong>IMPORTANT INFO when building your own code with this OTP release</strong></p> <p> Since erlang:now is deprecated your build might stop if you are using &quot;warnings as errors&quot;.</p> <p> To let the build through you can turn of warnings for deprecated functions by setting an environment variable like this:</p> <p> export ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS=nowarn_deprecated_function</p> <p> Some highlights of the release are:</p> <ul> <li> dialyzer: The -dialyzer() attribute can be used for suppressing warnings in a module by specifying functions or warning options. It can also be used for requesting warnings in a module.</li> <li> erts: The time functionality has been extended. This includes a new API for time, as well as &quot;time warp&quot; modes which alters the behavior when system time changes. You are strongly encouraged to use the new API instead of the old API based on erlang:now/0. erlang:now/0 has been deprecated since it will always be a scalability bottleneck. For more information see the Time and Time Correction chapter of the ERTS User&#39;s Guide. Here is a link&nbsp;<a href="http://www.erlang.org/documentation/doc-7.0-rc1/erts-7.0/doc/html/time_correction.html">http://www.erlang.org/documentation/doc-7.0-rc1/erts-7.0/doc/html/time_correction.html</a></li> <li> &nbsp;</li> <li> erts: Beside the API changes and time warp modes a lot of scalability and performance improvements regarding time management has been made. Examples are: <br /> <ul> <li> scheduler specific timer wheels,</li> <li> scheduler specific BIF timer management,</li> <li> parallel retrieval of monotonic time and system time on OS:es that support it.</li> </ul> </li> <li> erts: The previously introduced &quot;eager check I/O&quot; feature is now enabled by default.</li> <li> erts/compiler: enhanced support for maps. Big maps new uses a HAMT (Hash Array Mapped Trie) representation internally which makes them more efficient. There is now also support for variables as map keys. &nbsp;</li> <li> ssl: Remove default support for SSL-3.0 and added padding check for TLS-1.0 due to the Poodle vulnerability.</li> <li> ssl: Remove default support for RC4 cipher suites, as they are consider too weak.</li> <li> stdlib: Allow maps for supervisor flags and child specs</li> </ul> <p> &nbsp;</p> <p> You can find the Release Notes with more detailed info at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.erlang.org/download/otp18rc1_relnotes.pdf">http://www.erlang.org/download/otp18rc1_relnotes.pdf</a></p> <p> You find the source code at github.com in the official Erlang repository.</p> <p> Git tag OTP-18.0-rc1</p> <p> <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/tree/OTP-18.0-rc1">https://github.com/erlang/otp/tree/OTP-18.0-rc1<br /> </a></p> <p> You can also read the documentation on-line here: (see the Release Notes mentioned above for release notes which are not updated in the doc, but the new functionality is)</p> <p> <a href="http://www.erlang.org/documentation/doc-7.0-rc1/doc/">http://www.erlang.org/documentation/doc-7.0-rc1/doc/<br /> </a></p> <p> We also want to thank those that sent us patches, suggestions and bug reports.</p> <p> The Erlang/OTP Team at Ericsson</p> </content>

    <lead> Erlang/OTP R16B03-1 has been released! See the Readme file and the Documentation for more details. </lead>
    <twitter-status/>
    <content><p> OTP R16B03-1 is a service release which corrects a few issues found in the R16B03 release. The corrections are:</p> <ul> <li> The ODBC application was missing in the prebuilt Windows installers</li> <li> 3 corrections in the SSL application: <ul> <li> Add missing validation of the server_name_indication option and test for its explicit use.</li> <li> Elliptic curve selection in server mode now properly selects a curve suggested by the client, if possible.</li> <li> The server did not indicate support for secure renegotiation during TLS extension handling.</li> </ul> </li> <li> In the syntax tools application a bug was introduced which broke reverting of local funs. This is now corrected (thanks to Anthony Ramine)</li> <li> wx - Solved a problem which caused the debugger to crash when closing a window. Fixed static linking on Mac.</li> <li> xmerl - Fixed a problem in the SAX-parser when the header of the next document was appearing in the buffer when using the xmerl_sax_parser:stream/2 function.</li> </ul> </content>

    <title>Erlang/OTP 17.0-rc2 has been released</title>
    <lead>Erlang/OTP 17.0-rc2 has been released. This is a beta release before the 17.0 product release. </lead>
    <twitter-status/>
    <content><h3> Erlang/OTP 17.0-rc2 has been released.</h3> <p> This is a beta release, which will be followed by the final OTP 17.0 product release in the beginning of April.</p> <p> Between this beta and the final release there will be new updates of the master branch with corrections and minor new features. Occasionally there might be new tags which we in that case will communicate and ask you to test.</p> <p> Erlang/OTP 17.0 is a new major release with new features, quite a few (characteristics) improvements, as well as some incompatibilities. See the README file and the documentation for more details.</p> <p> We would like to ask you to download and test the beta release and send us your feedback as soon as possible, so that we can make the necessary corrections before OTP 17.0.</p> <p> The release contains many changes and a few potential incompatibilities. Please try to build and run your current products/applications and let us know about any problems.</p> <p> One known, but previously insufficiently documented incompatibility that we would like to highlight is:</p> <p> OTP-11719 == erts == </p> <p> <strong>The default encoding of Erlang files has been changed from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8. The encoding of XML files has also been changed to UTF-8.</strong></p> <p> Please verify that your source code compiles with Erlang/OTP 17. If your (ISO-8559-1 / Latin-1 encoded) source code files contain characters that are outside of the bit 7-bit ASCII character set, you will receive a compiler error similar to the following:</p> <pre>tst.erl:1: cannot parse file, giving up tst.erl:1: no module definition tst.erl:1: cannot translate from UTF-8 </pre> <p> In this case, you need to apply one of the following alternatives to each (impacted) file:</p> <p> Alternative 1: Encode the file in UTF-8 (instead of Latin-1). If the file is going to be compiled with both OTP 17 and previous versions, insert a comment stating the encoding at the beginning of the file:</p> <pre> %% -*- coding: utf-8 -*- </pre> <p> Alternative 2: Leave the file encoded as Latin-1 and insert a comment stating the encoding at the beginning of the file:</p> <pre> %% -*- coding: latin-1 -*- </pre> <p> For detailed information, <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/unicode_usage.html">see the STDLIB User&#39;s Guide, 2 Using Unicode in Erlang</a></p> <p> The 17.0 release contains many changes; thus, some unexpected incompatibilities or issues may have slipped through our tests. Please try to build and run your current products/applications and let us know about any problems.</p> <p> Note! The new datatype MAP is not properly documented yet but the EEP 43 https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0043.html will provide a good start. Also note that it is a limited implementation of maps implemented so far:</p> <ul> <li> no variable keys are allowed</li> <li> native code can not be generated for modules using maps</li> </ul> <p> Some other highlights of the release are:</p> <ul> <li> Erlang/OTP has been ported to the realtime operating system OSE.</li> <li> Maps, a new dictionary data type (experimental)</li> <li> A more natural mapping from ASN.1 OCTET STRING and BIT STRING to Erlang types, and other ASN.1 improvements and optimizations</li> <li> The {active, N} socket option for TCP, UDP, and SCTP</li> <li> A new (optional) scheduler utilization balancing mechanism</li> <li> Migration of memory carriers has been enabled by default on all ERTS internal memory allocators</li> <li> Increased garbage collection tenure rate</li> <li> Experimental &quot;dirty schedulers&quot; functionality</li> <li> Funs can now be given names</li> <li> Miscellaneous unicode support enhancements</li> <li> A new, semantic version scheme for OTP and its applications</li> </ul> <p> You can find the README file with more detailed info at <a href="http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_17.0-rc2.readme">http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_17.0-rc2.readme</a></p> <p> You can download the full source distribution from <a href="http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_17.0-rc2.tar.gz">http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_17.0-rc2.tar.gz</a></p> <p> Note: To unpack the TAR archive you need a GNU TAR compatible program.

It can for example be used for pre-allocation of all memory that the runtime system should be able to use. It is enabled by passing the +MMscs (size in MB) command line argument. For more information see the documentation of the +MMsco, +MMscrfsd, +MMscrpm, +MMscs, +MMusac, and, +Mlpm command line arguments in the erts_alloc(3) documentation.</li> <li style="margin-left: 15px;"> The LDAP client (eldap application) now supports the start_tls operation.

Apart from<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;reducing contention this also ensures that memory allocators<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;always create memory segments on the local NUMA node on a<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;NUMA system.</p> <p> OTP-9632 &nbsp;An ERTS internal, generic, many to one, lock-free queue for<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;communication between threads has been introduced. The many<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to one scenario is very common in ERTS, so it can be used in<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a lot of places in the future. Currently it is used by<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;scheduling of certain jobs, and the async thread pool, but<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;more uses are planned for the future.</p> <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Drivers using the driver_async functionality are not<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;automatically locked to the system anymore, and can be<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;unloaded as any dynamically linked in driver.</p> <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scheduling of ready async jobs is now also interleaved in<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;between other jobs. Previously all ready async jobs were<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;performed at once.</p> <p> OTP-9631 &nbsp;The ERTS internal system block functionality has been<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;replaced by new functionality for blocking the system. The<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;old system block functionality had contention issues and<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;complexity issues. The new functionality piggy-backs on<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;thread progress tracking functionality needed by newly<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;introduced lock-free synchronization in the runtime system.<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the functionality for blocking the system isn&#39;t used,<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;there is more or less no overhead at all. This since the<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;functionality for tracking thread progress is there and<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;needed anyway.</p> <p> ... and much much more.</p> <p> This is not a full release of R15 but rather a pre-release. Feel free to try our R15A release and get back to us&nbsp;with your findings.</p> <p> Your feedback is important to us and highly welcomed.</p> <p> Regards,</p> <p> The OTP Team</p> </content>

    <twitter-status/>
    <content><p> Erlang/OTP R13B03 has been released. R13B03 is a service release for R13B. There are mostly error corrections, but also some new functionality. Some highlights in the R13B03 release are:</p> <ul> <li> <a href="/doc/man/erl_nif.html">Native Implemented Functions (NIFs)</a> still experimental but very useful. Feedback is welcome.</li> <li> Beginning with this release we will maintain (and update on a daily basis) a GIT repository <a href="http://github.com/erlang/otp">on GitHub</a>. The intention is that this will make it easier for users to contribute with bugfixes and new functionality and also easier for us to receive the contributions.</li> <li> The documentation is built in a new way using xsltproc and Apache FOP. The layout is changed both in HTML and PDF versions. This is the first step, more changes and improvements will come in the following releases.</li> <li> A completely new erlang.org web site (this one) is also on its way but slightly delayed. Will be launched really soon now.</li> </ul> <p> Download the new release from the <a href="/download">download page</a>.</p> </content>

    <title>Erlang/OTP 17.0-rc1 has been released</title>
    <lead> The first release candidate for the next major Erlang/OTP release 17.0 is released </lead>
    <twitter-status/>
    <content><h3> Erlang/OTP 17.0-rc1 has been released.</h3> <p> This is an alpha release, which will be followed by a planned beta release about a month later and a final OTP 17.0 product release in the end of March, 2014.</p> <p> Between the alpha and beta and final release there will be new updates of the master branch with corrections and minor new features. Occasionally there might be new tags which we in that case will communicate and ask you to test.</p> <p> Erlang/OTP 17.0 is a new major release with new features, quite a few (characteristics) improvements, as well as some incompatibilities. See the README file and the documentation for more details.</p> <p> We would like to ask you to download and test the alpha release and send us your feedback as soon as possible, so that we can make the necessary corrections before OTP 17.0-rc2 and OTP 17.0, respectively.</p> <p> The release contains many changes; thus, some unexpected incompatibilities or issues may have slipped through our tests. Please try to build and run your current products/applications and let us know about any problems.</p> <p> Note! The new datatype MAP is not properly documented yet but the EEP 43 https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0043.html will provide a good start. Also note that it is a limited implementation of maps implemented so far:</p> <ul> <li> no variable keys are allowed</li> <li> native code can not be generated for modules using maps</li> </ul> <p> Some other highlights of the release are:</p> <ul> <li> Maps, a new dictionary data type (experimental)</li> <li> A more natural mapping from ASN.1 OCTET STRING and BIT STRING to Erlang types, and other ASN.1 improvements and optimizations</li> <li> The {active, N} socket option for TCP, UDP, and SCTP</li> <li> A new (optional) scheduler utilization balancing mechanism</li> <li> Migration of memory carriers has been enabled by default on all ERTS internal memory allocators</li> <li> Increased garbage collection tenure rate</li> <li> Experimental &quot;dirty schedulers&quot; functionality</li> <li> Funs can now be given names</li> <li> Miscellaneous unicode support enhancements</li> <li> A new, semantic version scheme for OTP and its applications</li> </ul> <p> You can find the README file with more detailed info at <a href="http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_17.0-rc1.readme">http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_17.0-rc1.readme</a></p> <p> You can download the full source distribution from <a href="http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_17.0-rc1.tar.gz">http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_17.0-rc1.tar.gz</a></p> <p> Note: To unpack the TAR archive you need a GNU TAR compatible program.

    <lead>We are improving the contents of erlang.org and need input from the community. This is your chance to get your Erlang code examples published. </lead>
    <twitter-status/>
    <content><p> We are aware that parts of erlang.org need improvement. For example <a href="http://www.erlang.org/article/tag/examples">http://www.erlang.org/article/tag/examples</a> and <a href="http://www.erlang.org/course/course.html">http://www.erlang.org/course/course.html</a> are outdated. We would like to see a number of small code examples for beginners. The purpose of these examples is to provide an attractive and useful introduction for people who are interested in adopting the Erlang programming language.&nbsp;</p> <p> Please send your input to <a href="mailto:community-manager@erlang.org">community-manager@erlang.org</a>. We would like to call for help from the community since OTP team does not have too much time and it is not possible to submit pull requests for editorial of erlang.org as of now.&nbsp;</p> <p> Any other suggestions for erlang.org are always welcome.</p></content>
