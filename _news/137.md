Erlang/OTP 22.3 is the last planned patch package for the 22 major release with new features, improvements and bugfixes. Below follows some highlights.

### Highlights
* ssl/public_key: * Implementation of the key and initialization vector
 update feature, and general hardening of TLS 1.3.
 There are cryptographic limits on the amount of
 plaintext which can be safely encrypted under a given set of keys.
 This change enforces those limits by triggering
 automatic key updates on TLS 1.3 connections.
* Add support for TLS 1.3 Session Tickets (stateful and
 stateless). This allows session resumption using keying
 material from a previous successful handshake.
* Add support for key exchange with Edward curves and
 PSS-RSA padding in signature verification.
* erts: * A socket "registry" has been added making it possible to list current open sockets.
* Add a "full featured" version of getifaddrs in the net module.
* ssh: * The new functions ssh:set_sock_opts/2 and ssh:get_sock_opts/2 sets and reads option values for
 the underlying TCP stream.
* Changes to the internal api of the experimental `ssh_dbg` tool.
* common_test: The ct_property_test has now a report function for
 results of stateful testing.
* stdlib: * Implement uri_string:resolve/{2,3} that can be used to
 resolve a URI reference against a base URI.
* In gen_statem it is now possible to change the callback
 module for a running server. See gen_statem's
 documentation for `change_callback_module`,
`push_callback_module`, and `pop_callback_module`.
