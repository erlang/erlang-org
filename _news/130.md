The Erlang Workshop aims to bring together the open source, academic, and industrial communities of Erlang, to discuss technologies and languages related to Erlang. The Erlang model of concurrent programming has been widely emulated, for example by Akka in Scala, and even new programming languages were designed atop of the Erlang VM, such as Elixir. Therefore we would like to broaden the scope of the workshop to include systems like those mentioned above. For more info see [http://erlang.org/workshop/2019/](http://erlang.org/workshop/2019/)
