 We are aware that parts of erlang.org need improvement. For example [https://www.erlang.org/article/tag/examples](https://www.erlang.org/article/tag/examples) and [https://www.erlang.org/course/course.html](https://www.erlang.org/course/course.html) are outdated. We would like to see a number of small code examples for beginners. The purpose of these examples is to provide an attractive and useful introduction for people who are interested in adopting the Erlang programming language. 

 Please send your input to [community-manager@erlang.org](mailto:community-manager@erlang.org). We would like to call for help from the community since OTP team does not have too much time and it is not possible to submit pull requests for editorial of erlang.org as of now. 

 Any other suggestions for erlang.org are always welcome.
