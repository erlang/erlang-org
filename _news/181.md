## OTP 28.1

Erlang/OTP 28.1 is the first maintenance patch package for OTP 28, with mostly bug fixes as well as improvements.


### Potential incompatibilities:

* The internal `inet_dns_tsig` and `inet_res` modules have been fixed to TSIG
  verify the correct timestamp.
  In the process two undocumented error code atoms have been corrected to
  `notauth` and `notzone` to adhere to the DNS RFCs. Code that relied on the
  previous incorrect values may have to be corrected.

## HIGHLIGHTS

* A User's Guide to `dbg` is now available in the documentation.
* Support for quantum crypto signature algorithm ML-DSA and key exchange algorithm ML-KEM (ssl, public_key and crypto if built and linked with OpenSSL 3.5).
* Support for ML-DSA and ML-KEM provided by OpenSSL 3.5 (crypto if built and linked with OpenSSL 3.5).
