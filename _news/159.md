## OTP 25.2

Erlang/OTP 25.2 is the second maintenance patch package for OTP 25, with mostly bug fixes as well as improvements.

Below are some highlights of the release:

### Potential incompatibilities:
- The inet:setopts/2 {reuseaddr, true} option will now be
ignored on Windows unless the socket is an UDP socket.
For more information see the documentation of the
reuseaddr option part of the documentation of
inet:setopts/2. Prior to OTP 25 the {reuseaddr, true} option was
ignored for all sockets on Windows, but as of OTP 25.0
this was changed so that it was not ignored for any
sockets.
