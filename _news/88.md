Erlang/OTP 18.1 is a service release on the 18 track with mostly bug fixes, but is does contain a number of new features and characteristics improvements as well.

 Some highlights of the release are:
* ssl: Add possibility to downgrade an SSL/TLS connection to a tcp connection, and give back the socket control to a user process.
* ssh: The following new key exchange algorithms are implemented:'ecdh-sha2-nistp256', 'ecdh-sha2-nistp384', 'ecdh-sha2-nistp521','diffie-hellman-group14-sha1', 'diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1' and 'diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256'. This raises the security level considerably.
* kernel,stdlib,sasl: A mechanism for limiting the amount of text that the built-in error logger events will produce has been introduced. It is useful for limiting both the size of log files and the CPU time used to produce them. 
 This mechanism is experimental in the sense that it may be changed based on feedback. See config parameter error_logger_format_depth in the Kernel application.
