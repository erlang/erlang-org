Some highlights of the release are:
 * compiler, stdlib: * New preprocessor macros **?FUNCTION_NAME, ?FUNCTION_ARITY**
* New preprocessor directives -error(Term) and -warning(Term) to cause a compilation error or warning, respectively.
* **gen_statem** a new state machine behavior
* **mnesia_ext**: plugin of external storage solutions to mnesia
* **crypto**: uses EVP interface in OpenSSL resulting in generally better performance and support for HW acceleration
* **ssh**: performance improvements, uses the new gen_statem behavior
* **ssl**: enhanced error log messages
* **dialyzer**: the support for maps is very much extended both the type specification syntax and the type analysis.
* **erts**: * erlang:open_port(spawn, ...) 3-5 times faster
* tracing, extensive improvements (scalability, speed, match specifications on send/receive, support for lttng, ...)
* dirty schedulers improved
* per process configurable handling of message_queue
* fast loading of multiple modules
* max_heap_size process flag
* **erts/kernel:*** `Experimental support for Unix Domain Sockets`
`Example:``gen_udp:open(0, [{ifaddr,{local,"/tmp/socket"}}])`
* and much more ....
