Some highlights for 19.2
* STDLIB: The new behaviour gen_statem has been improved with 3 new features: the possibility to use old style non-proxy timeouts for gen_statem:call/2,3, state entry code, and state timeouts. These are backwards compatible. Minor code and documentation improvements has been performed including a borderline semantics correction of timeout zero handling.
* SSL: Experimental version of DTLS. It is runnable but not complete and cannot be considered reliable for production usage. To use DTLS add the option {protocol, dtls} to ssl:connect and ssl:listen.
* SSH: Extended the option silently_accept_hosts for ssh:connect to make it possible for the client to check the SSH host key fingerprint string. Se the reference manual for SSH.
* ~40 contributions since the previous service release OTP 19.1
