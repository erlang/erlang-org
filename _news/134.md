We have migrated our email-list to a new server, and during the move we accidentally sent out a email to everyone saying that you have been unsubscribed from the email-list.

This is not true, and you are still subscribed to all the list you where subscribed to before this happened.

This move might be accompanied by a small delay in email traffic due to MX propagation delays.

We do apologize for the inconvenience!
