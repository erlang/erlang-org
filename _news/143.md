Erlang/OTP 23.2 is the second maintenance patch release for OTP 23, with mostly bug fixes as well as a few improvements.

A few of the changes and highlights are:

### SSL

Handle extraneous certs in certificate chains as well as chains that are incomplete but can be reconstructed or unordered chains. The cert and certfile options will now accept a list of certificates so that the user may specify the chain explicitly.

### Potential incompatibility

#### stdlib

Improved the API and documentation of the uri_string module. Added a new chapter to the Users Guide about Uniform Resource Identifiers and their handling with the new API. Added two new API functions: uri_string:allowed_characters/0 and uri_string:percent_decode/1.

This change has been marked as potentially incompatible as uri_string:normalize/2 used to decode percent-encoded character triplets that corresponded to characters not in the reserved set. After this change, uri_string:normalize/2 will only decode those percent-encoded triplets that correspond to characters in the unreserved set (ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~").
