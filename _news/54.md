 To encourage a welcoming, inclusive climate for communication within the erlang.org community, the Erlang/OTP team, together with members of the community, has released a new code of conduct, available at </download/erlang_org_code_of_conduct.txt>. This code of conduct lays out a guideline of how to communicate within the erlang.org community in a way we hope is easy to read, help mutual understanding and avoid flames. The erlang.org community is by definition all communication in or around erlang.org, including but not limited to the erlang.org mailing lists or Github discussions.   This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.  </download/erlang_org_code_of_conduct.txt>
