 Erlang/OTP17.1 is a service release on the 17 track with mostly bug fixes, but is does contain a number of new features and characteristics improvements as well. 

 Some highlights of the release are:
* crypto: Add aes_cfb8 cypher to crypto:block_encrypt and block_decrypt.
* diameter: Add result code counters for CEA, DWA, and DPA.
* erts: The following built in functions in the erlang and binary modules now bump an appropriate amount 
 of reductions and yield when out of reductions:
 binary_to_list/1, binary_to_list/3, bitstring_to_list/1, list_to_binary/1, 
 iolist_to_binary/1, list_to_bitstring/1, binary:list_to_bin/1
* hipe: Handle Maps instructions get_map_elements, put_map_assoc, 
 put_map_exact in the HiPE native code compiler.
* mnesia: The time for inserting locks for a transaction with large 
 number of locks is reduced significantly.
* ssh: Option max_sessions added to ssh:daemon/{2,3}.
* stdlib: Add maps:get/3 to maps module. The function will return the 
 supplied default value if the key does not exist in the map.
