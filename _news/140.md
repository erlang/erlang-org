## OTP 23

Erlang/OTP 23 is a new major release with new features, improvements as well as a few incompatibilities.

### Potential Incompatibilities
* **SSL**: * Support for SSL 3.0 is completely removed.
* TLS 1.3 is added to the list of default supported versions.
* `erl_interface`: Removed the deprecated parts of `erl_interface` (`erl_interface.h` and essentially all C functions with prefix `erl_`).
* The deprecated `erlang:get_stacktrace/0` BIF now returns an empty list instead of a stacktrace. `erlang:get_stacktrace/0` is scheduled for removal in OTP 24.

### Improvements and new features
* **ssh**:
* OpenSSH 6.5 introduced a new file representation of keys called `openssh-key-v1`. This is now supported with the exception of handling encrypted keys.
* Algorithm configuration could now be done in a .config file. This is useful for example to enable an algorithm that is disabled by default without need to change the code.
* **SSL**:
* Support for the middlebox compatibility mode makes the TLS 1.3 handshake look more like a TLS 1.2 handshake and increases the chance of successfully establishing TLS 1.3 connections through legacy middleboxes.
* Add support for key exchange with Edward curves and PSS-RSA padding in signature verification
* The possibility to run Erlang distribution without relying on EPMD has been extended. To achieve this a couple of new options to the inet distribution has been added.
* `-dist_listen false` Setup the distribution channel, but do not listen for incoming connection.
* `-erl_epmd_port Port` Configure a default port that the built-in EPMD client should return.
* A first EXPERIMENTAL `socket` backend to
`gen_tcp` and `inet` has been implemented. `gen_udp` and `gen_sctp` will follow.
 Putting `{inet_backend, socket}` as first option to `listen()` or `connect()` makes it easy to try this for existing code
* A new module `erpc` in kernel which implements an enhanced subset of the operations provided by the `rpc` module. Enhanced in the sense that it makes it possible to distinguish between returned value, raised exceptions and other errors. `erpc` also has better performance and scalability than the original `rpc` implementation. This by utilizing the newly introduced `spawn_request()` BIF. Also the `rpc` module benefits from these improvements by utilizing `erpc` when possible.
* Scalability and performance Improvements plus new functionality regarding distributed spawn operations.
* In binary matching, the size of the segment to be matched is now allowed to be a guard expression (EEP-52)
* When matching with maps the keys can now be guard expressions (EEP-52).
* ssh: support for TCP/IP port forwarding, a.k.a tunnelling a.k.a as tcp-forward/direct-tcp is implemented. In the OpenSSH client, this corresponds to the options -L and -R.
* Allow underscores in numeric literals to improve readability. Examples: `123_456_789`, `16#1234_ABCD`.
* New functions in the shell for displaying documentation for Erlang modules, functions and types. The
 functions are:
* `h/1,2,3` -- Print the documentation for a `Module:Function/Arity`.
* `ht/1,2,3` -- Print the type documentation for a `Module:Type/Arity`.
 The embedded documentation is created as docchunks (EEP 48) when building the Erlang/OTP documentation.
* **kernel**: The module `pg` with a new implementation of distributed named process groups is introduced. The old module `pg2` is deprecated and scheduled for removal in OTP 24.
* Our tool chain for building the Windows packages is upgraded with new C++ compiler, Java compiler, OpenSSL libraries and wxWidgets versions. We are now using WSL (the Linux Subsystem for Windows when building) which makes it easier to handle the build environment.
