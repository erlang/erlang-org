 ## OTP 23 Release Candidate 1
 
This is the first of three planned release candidates before the OTP 23 release.
 The intention with this release is to get feedback from our users. **All feedback is welcome**, even if it is only to say that it works for you.
 
Erlang/OTP 23 is a new major release with new features, improvements as well as a few incompatibilities.
 ### Potential Incompatibilities
 * SSL: * Support for SSL 3.0 is completely removed.
* TLS 1.3 is added to the list of default supported versions.
* `erl_interface`: Removed the deprecated parts of `erl_interface`
 (`erl_interface.h` and essentially all C functions with prefix `erl_`).
* The deprecated `erlang:get_stacktrace/0` BIF now returns an empty list instead of a stacktrace.
 `erlang:get_stacktrace/0` is scheduled for removal in OTP 24.
* ...
 ### Highlights
 * A new module `erpc` in kernel which implements an enhanced subset of the operations provided by the `rpc` module. Enhanced in the sense that it makes it possible to distinguish between returned value, raised exceptions and other errors. `erpc` also has better performance and scalability than the original `rpc` implementation. This by utilizing the newly introduced `spawn_request()` BIF. Also the `rpc` module benefits from these improvements by utilizing `erpc` when possible.
* Scalability and performance Improvements plus new functionality regarding distributed spawn operations.
* In binary matching, the size of the segment to be matched is now allowed to be a guard expression (EEP-52)
* When matching with maps the keys can now be guard expressions (EEP-52).
* ssh: support for TCP/IP port forwarding, a.k.a tunneling a.k.a as tcp-forward/direct-tcp is implemented. In the OpenSSH client, this corresponds to the options -L and -R.
* Allow underscores in numeric literals to improve readability. Examples: `123_456_789`, `16#1234_ABCD`.
* New functions in the shell for displaying documentation for Erlang modules, functions and types. The
 functions are: * `h/1,2,3` -- Print the documentation for a `Module:Function/Arity`.
* `ht/1,2,3` -- Print the type documentation for a `Module:Type/Arity`.
 The embedded documentation is created as docchunks (EEP 48) when building the Erlang/OTP documentation.
* kernel: The module `pg` with a new implementation of distributed named process groups is introduced. The old module `pg2` is deprecated and scheduled for removal in OTP 24.
* Our tool chain for building the Windows packages is upgraded with new C++ compiler, Java compiler, OpenSSL libraries and wxWidgets versions. We are now using WSL (the Linux Subsystem for Windows when building) which makes it easier to handle the build environment.
* ...
