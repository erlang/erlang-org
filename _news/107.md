Some highlights of the release are:
* erts: Improved dirty scheduler support. A purge of a module will not have to wait for completion of all ongoing dirty NIF calls.
* erts: Improved accuracy of timeouts on MacOS X.
* kernel: Add `net_kernel:setopts/2` and `net_kernel:getopts/2` to control options for distribution sockets in runtime.
* asn1: Compiling multiple ASN.1 modules in the same directory with parallel make (make -j) should now be safe.
* httpd: support for PUT and DELETE in mod_esi
* ~30 contributions since 19.0
