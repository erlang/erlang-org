# OTP 21.2

Erlang/OTP 21.2 is the second service release for the 21st major release with, improvements as well as a few features!

## Highlights

SSH:
* Public key methods: ssh-ed25519 and ssh-ed448 added. Requires OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later as cryptolib under the OTP application

SSL:
* ssl now uses active n internally to boost performance. Old active once behaviour can be restored by setting a application variable.

ERTS, Kernel:
* New counters and atomics modules supplies access to highly efficient operations on mutable fixed word sized variables.
* New module persistent_term!. Lookups are in constant time! No copying the terms!
* New pollset made to handle sockets that use {active, true} or {active, N}. Polled by a normal scheduler!
* No more ONESHOT mechanism overhead on fds! Only on Linux and BSD
