 Erlang/OTP R13B03 has been released. R13B03 is a service release for R13B. There are mostly error corrections, but also some new functionality. Some highlights in the R13B03 release are:
* [Native Implemented Functions (NIFs)](/doc/man/erl_nif.html) still experimental but very useful. Feedback is welcome.
* Beginning with this release we will maintain (and update on a daily basis) a GIT repository [on GitHub](http://github.com/erlang/otp). The intention is that this will make it easier for users to contribute with bugfixes and new functionality and also easier for us to receive the contributions.
* The documentation is built in a new way using xsltproc and Apache FOP. The layout is changed both in HTML and PDF versions. This is the first step, more changes and improvements will come in the following releases.
* A completely new erlang.org web site (this one) is also on its way but slightly delayed. Will be launched really soon now.
