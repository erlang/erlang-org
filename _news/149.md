# OTP 24.1 

Erlang/OTP 24.1 is the first maintenance patch release for OTP 24, with mostly
bug fixes as well as a few improvements.

Below are some highlights of the release:

## Highlights

- **OTP**: [The Efficiency Guide](https://erlang.org/doc/efficiency_guide/users_guide.html) has been extended with a chapter about maps.

- **Stdlib**: Most output functions in the `io` module now print extra
    error information when provided with invalid arguments.
    The functions are: `io:format`, `io:fwrite`, `io:put_chars`,
    `io:nl` and `io:write`.

- **Erts**: `init:stop()` no longer unloads loaded code before
    terminating the runtime system. On systems with slow
    CPUs (such as Raspberry PI Zero), that can
    significantly speed up termination of the runtime system.
