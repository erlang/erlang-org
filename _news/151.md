Hello!

We are pleased to announce the launch of the new erlang.org website!

The design and content are roughly the same as the old website. The most notable changes are:

* The blog is moved
  * <https://www.erlang.org/blog>
* New downloads page with all patches
  * <https://www.erlang.org/downloads>
  * <https://www.erlang.org/downloads/24>
  * <https://www.erlang.org/patches/OTP-24.1>
* The documentation has integrated full-text search by [algolia]
  * <https://www.erlang.org/doc/>
  * Try searching for "lists", "erlang error" or "records"
* Updated and "flattened" docs for more versions
  * <https://www.erlang.org/docs/23/>
  * <https://www.erlang.org/docs/17/>

Some things from the old site has been removed:

* bugs.erlang.org has been removed and now redirects to <https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues>
* <https://www.erlang.org/erldoc> and <https://www.erlang.org/doc/search> have been replaced by algolia search
* The events section has been removed

The new website is built using Erlang + Jekyll + Bootstrap and the code is available here: <https://github.com/erlang/erlang-org/>

Please report any problems that you find as issues on <https://github.com/erlang/erlang-org>.

Lukas and the Erlang/OTP team
