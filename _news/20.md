 Erlang/OTP R15B has been released as planned on December 14:th 2011.

 See the release notes in the [readme file](https://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_R15B.readme).

 Download the new release from the [download page](https://erlang.org/download.html).

**Highlights:
**
* Line number and filename information are now included in exception backtraces. This information will be pretty-printed in the shell and used in crash reports etc. In practice it will be much easier to find where something failed.
* The driver interface has been changed to enable 64-bit aware drivers. Most importantly the return types for ErlDrvEntry callbacks 'call' and 'control' has been changed which require drivers to be changed.
* New in this release is the support for 64 bit  Windows. The self extracting installer can be found [here](https://www.erlang.org/download/otp_win64_R15B.exe).
* CommonTest hooks are now in a final supported version.
* There is a new GUI tool in the observer application which integrates pman, etop, appmon and tv into one tool. The tool does also contain functions for activating tracing in an easy way.
* The Erlang distribution can now be run over the new SSL implementation.
