## OTP 25.1

Erlang/OTP 25.1 is the first maintenance patch package for OTP 25, with mostly bug fixes as well as quite many small improvements.

Below are some highlights of the release:

### crypto:
- Crypto is now considered to be usable with the OpenSSL
  3.0 cryptolib for production code.
  ENGINE and FIPS are not yet fully functional.

- Changed the behaviour of the engine load/unload
    functions


### ssl:
- A vulnerability has been discovered and corrected. It
  is registered as CVE-2022-37026 "Client Authentication
  Bypass". Corrections have been released on the
  supported tracks with patches 23.3.4.15, 24.3.4.2, and
  25.0.2. The vulnerability might also exist in older OTP
  versions. We recommend that impacted users upgrade to
  one of these versions or later on the respective
  tracks. OTP 25.1 would be an even better choice.
  Impacted are those who are running an `ssl/tls/dtls`
  server using the `ssl` application either directly or
  indirectly via other applications. For example via
  `inets` (`httpd`), `cowboy`, etc. Note that the vulnerability
  only affects servers that request client certification,
  that is sets the option `{verify, verify_peer}`.
