EEP 57: Extending the syntax of patterns with alternative matches
----

Abstract
========

Currently Erlang only supports a single match in expression when defining a
pattern match in case, receive expressions, function clauses, lambdas,
try-of, and try-catch, the generators in list and bit-string comprehensions,
and function arguments.

This proposal extends the syntax to allow multiple alternative matches to
share the same body or to be matched against a right hand side expression.

Specification
=============

Currently, a match in a case, receive, try-of expression looks similar to
this syntax:

```erlang
case I of
  1 -> less_than_three;
  2 -> less_than_three;
  3 -> less_than_ten;
  _ -> other
end.
```

This should be changed to allow:

```erlang
case I of
  1 | 2 -> less_than_three;
  3     -> less_than_ten;
  _     -> other
end.
```

Similarly, a function or an expression match looks like:

```erlang
foo(1) -> ok;
foo(2) -> ok;
foo(N) -> other.
```

More generally, a pattern in a case, receive, try-of expression, lambda,
or a pattern match, should be extended from the following:

```erlang
case Expr of
    Pattern1 [when GuardSeq1] ->
        Body1;
    ...;
    PatternN [when GuardSeqN] ->
        BodyN
end

receive
    Pattern1 [when GuardSeq1] ->
        Body1;
    ...;
    PatternN [when GuardSeqN] ->
        BodyN
after ExprT ->
    BodyT
end

try Exp [of
    Pattern1 [when GuardSeq1] ->
        Body1;
    ...;
    PatternN [when GuardSeqN] ->
        BodyN
    ]
catch
    Class1:ExceptionPattern1[:Stacktrace] [when ExceptionGuardSeq1] ->
        ExceptionBody1;
    ...;
    ClassN:ExceptionPatternN[:Stacktrace] [when ExceptionGuardSeqN] ->
        ExceptionBodyN
end

Res = ExprF(Expr1,...,ExprN)
```

to support the following syntax:

```erlang
case Expr of
    Pattern1A |
    Pattern1B |
    ...
    Pattern1N [when GuardSeq1] ->
        Body1;
    ...;
    PatternNA |
    PatternNB |
    ...
    PatternNN [when GuardSeqN] ->
        BodyN
end

receive
    Pattern1A |
    Pattern1B |
    ...
    Pattern1N [when GuardSeq1] ->
        Body1;
    ...;
    PatternNA |
    PatternNB |
    ...
    PatternNN [when GuardSeqN] ->
        BodyN
after ExprT ->
    BodyT
end

try Exp [of
    Pattern1A |
    Pattern1B |
    ...
    Pattern1N [when GuardSeq1] ->
        Body1;
    ...;
    PatternNA |
    PatternNB |
    ...
    PatternNN [when GuardSeqN] ->
        BodyN
    ]
catch
    Class1:ExceptionPattern1A|
           ExceptionPattern2A| ...
           ExceptionPatternNA[:StackTrace] [when ExceptionGuard1A] ->
        ExceptionBodyE1;
    ClassN:ExceptionPattern1N|
           ExceptionPattern2N| ...
           ExceptionPatternNN[:StackTrace] [when ExceptionGuardNN] ->
        ExceptionBodyEN
end

Res1 | Res2 | ... | ResN =
  ExprF(Expr1, Expr2, ... , ExprN)

ExprF1(Expr1A1 | Expr1A2 | ... | Expr1AN, ...,
       Expr1N1 | Expr1N2 | ... | Expr1NN) [when GuardSeq1] -> Body1;
ExprFN(ExprNA1 | ExprNA2 | ... | ExprNAN, ...,
       ExprNN1 | ExprNN2 | ... | ExprNNN) [when GuardSeq1] -> Body1
```

A variable can only be used in the guards if its bound in all alternative
patterns. That is, the following is allowed:

```erlang
case X of
    {A, 0} | {0, A} when A > 0 -> ok
end

{A, 1} | {A, 2} = foo()

bar({A, 1} | {A, 2}) -> true
```

and the following is not allowed:

```erlang
case X of
    {A, 0} |
    {0, B} when B > 0 -> ok
end

{A, 1} | {B, 2} = foo()

bar({A, 1} | {B, 2}) -> true
```

The cases shown above would produce a compilation error in the form:

```erlang
Error: alternative patterns must have the same variables defined
```

In cases when the use of `|` becomes ambiguous, such as when using
in combination with cons in lists, the precedence is given to the
legacy cons syntax, and parenthesis can be used to disambiguate the
alternative match expressions:

```erlang
case X of
  [3 | T]     -> {ok, T};
  [1 | 2 | T] -> error;   % Compiler error: ambiguous use of pipe symbol
  [(1|2) | T] ->
    % Alternative matches, of lists' head being 1 or 2
    {ok, T}
end

[(1|2) | T] = check_head_version(L)
```

Choice of a Delimiter for Alternative Patterns
----------------------------------------------

In this specification we propose to use the pipe `|` symbol as the
delimiter of alternative patters for the following reasons:

1. It is already used for a similar reason in type specs
   (e.g. `-spec f(foo|bar) -> ok.`), and this natural choice of the
   delimiter would be consistent.
2. It is familiar as the "or" condition to people coming from other
   languages.

A possible alternative would be to use the `;` delimiter, which
presently has a similar meaning as the `or` condition separating terms
in guards, "if" expressions, and list comprehensions.

However, the semicolon (`;`) could create confusion in identifying
the end of the pattern in a statement or in separating expressions. E.g.:

```erlang
case Expr of
  a ->
    true = foo();  % <-- is this the end of the body or a syntax error
                   %     which should be a comma, with the body
                   %     returning 'b'?

  b;               % <-- is this the alternative pattern or a pattern
                   %     with a missing body?
  C when is_integer(C) ->
    false
end
```

Additionally, `;` is used to separate clauses in if, case, receive,
try-of-catch, fun and functions.  This would potentially create more
confusion if it's selected as the delimiter of alternative patterns.

Another possible alternative would be to allow to skip bodies in the
if, case, recieve, try-of and fun expressions:

```erlang
case Expr of
  a ->
  b ->
  c ->
    true;
  _ ->
    false
end
```

However, the application of the same principle for representing
alternative patterns in matching returns of function calls would cause
more confusion:

```erlang
a -> b -> c = foo()
```

Nested Alternative Patterns
---------------------------

There are two approaches of dealing with the alternative patters:

1. Permitting only the top-level alternation (e.g.
   `Expr1 | Expr2 | ... | ExprN`)
2. Permitting unlimited nesting
   (e.g. `{a|{b|c, d}} | e | {f|g, [(h|i), (j|k) | [(l|m)]]}`)

While supporting the nested patterns is desirable, depending on the
complexity of implementation, the unlimited nesting may be decided
not to be supported.  More specifically, it may turn out that the
complexity of implementing nested patterns by the compiler outweighs
the benefits of this feature.

Overlapping Patterns
--------------------

In cases when alternative patterns overlap, the natural left-to-right
evaluation order would be used similar to the order of patterns in
a `case` statement. E.g.

```erlang
{a, X} | {X, b} = foo()
```

This example would be equivalent to:

```erlang
case foo() of
  Term = {a, X} -> Term;
  Term = {X, b} -> Term;
  Term -> error({badmatch, Term})
end
```

Rationale
=========

Implementation of this proposal would lead to a more
convenient way to code redundant matching clauses, and
would eliminate code duplication.

Example of where this could be useful can be found in
many places in the existing OTP code. E.g. ssl_logger.erl:

```erlang
case logger:compare_levels(Level, debug) of
    lt ->
        ?LOG_DEBUG(#{direction => Direction,
                     protocol => Protocol,
                     message => Message},
                   #{domain => [otp,ssl,Protocol]});
    eq ->
        ?LOG_DEBUG(#{direction => Direction,
                     protocol => Protocol,
                     message => Message},
                   #{domain => [otp,ssl,Protocol]});
    _ ->
        ok
end.

case logger:compare_levels(Level, notice) of
    lt ->
        ?LOG_NOTICE(Report);
    eq ->
        ?LOG_NOTICE(Report);
    _ ->
        ok
end.
```

Additionally, this syntax extension leads to consistency between
function spec definitions and their implementations:

```erlang
-spec f(foo|bar) -> ok.
f(foo|bar) -> ok.
```

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

Any code that uses the legacy implementation of the case and receive
expressions will continue to work as it does today and produce
the same results.

Reference Implementation
========================

As an implementation suggestion, the AST can be rewritten by to duplicate
the alternative patterns containing the pipe, so the case of
``X of lt | gt -> ok end`` becomes ``case X of lt -> ok; gt -> ok end``.
For match expressions, it could rewrite ``lt | gt = compare(A, B)``
to a case statement ``case compare(A, B) of lt -> lt; gt -> gt end``,
and nested alternative patterns could use guards for rewriting matching,
e.g.:function argument matches ``foo(lt | gt, a | b) -> true`` would become:

```erlang
foo(lt | gt, a | b) -> true
```

becomes:

```erlang
foo(A, B) ->
  case A of
    _ when A =:= lt; A =:= gt ->
    case B of
      _ when B =:= a; B =:= b ->
            . . .
      end
  end
```

Rewriting alternative patterns in list comprehensions by the compiler
presents an additional challenge.  Implementations suggestions include
the following:

```erlang
[X || {a,X} | {b,X} <- L]
```

becomes:

```erlang
[case I of
    {a, X} | {b, X} -> X
 end
 || I <- L,
 case I of
    {a, _} | {b, _} -> true;
    _               -> false
 end
]
```

or:

```erlang
[X || {X} <-
    [case Item of
         {a,X0} | {b,X0} ->
             {X0}; % Set of matched variables
         _ ->
             nomatch
     end || Item <- L]]
```
