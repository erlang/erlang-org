        release_note: "The possibility of choosing a handler process for an incoming Diameter request with a configured MFA was documented in OTP 20.0, but counters (with {traffic_counters, true}) were not incremented when this process was on a remote node. Counters are now incremented on the node that configures the transport in question.\n\nIntroduced in OTP 21.3.\n\n"

      OTP-16459:
        type: " --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---"
        release_note: "Transport options differing from those passed to diameter:add_transport/2 were used in several situations: when starting a transport process after connect_timer expiry after an initial connection attempt has failed, when starting a transport process after a connection has been accepted, when sending events, when returning options in diameter:service_info/2, and possibly more. In particular, the following configuration options to diameter:add_transport/2 were dropped: avp_dictionaries, incoming_maxlen, spawn_opt, strict_mbit.\n\nMoreover, any service options mistakenly passed to diameter:add_transport/2 were interpreted as such, instead of being ignored as the documentation states, with the consequence that outgoing and incoming requests saw different values of some options, some were always taken from transport options, and others from service options.\n\ndiameter:add_transport/2 must be called in new code for the fix to have effect.\n\nIntroduced in OTP 20.1.\n\n"
