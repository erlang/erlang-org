        release_note: "The documentation of statistics(run_queue) erroneously stated that it returns the total length of all normal run queues when it is the total length of all normal and dirty CPU run queues that is returned. The documentation has been updated to reflect the actual behavior.\n\n"

        release_note: "Two bugs in the ERTS internal thread wakeup functionality have been fixed. These bugs mainly hit when all threads in the system tried to go to sleep. When the bugs were triggered, certain operations were delayed until a thread woke up due to some other reason. Most important operations effected were code loading, persistent term updates, and memory deallocation.\n\n"

      OTP-16856:
        type: " --- Improvements and New Features ---"
        release_note: "As of OTP 22, the allocator specific memory carrier pools were replaced by a node global carrier pool. This unfortunately caused substantial memory fragmentation in some cases due to long lived data being spread into carriers used by allocators mainly handling short lived data.\n\nA new command line argument +M<S>cp has been introduced with which one can enable the old behavior as well as configuring other behaviors for the carrier pools. In order to configure the old behavior, with allocator specific carrier pools for all allocators, pass +Mucp : (including the colon character) as a command line argument to erl when starting the Erlang system.\n\nThe default configuration for carrier pools will be changed to +Mucp : some time in the future, but not in this patch.\n\n"
