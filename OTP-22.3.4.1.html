      OTP-16639:
        type: " --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---"
        release_note: "The functionality utilized by BIFs for temporary disabling of garbage collection while yielding could cause system task queues to become inconsistent on a process executing such a BIF. Process system tasks are for example utilized when purging code, garbage collecting literal data, and when issuing an ordinary garbage collection from another process.\n\nThe bug does not trigger frequently. Multiple code purges in direct sequence makes it more likely that this bug is triggered. In the cases observed, this has resulted in a hanging code purge operation.\n\n"
