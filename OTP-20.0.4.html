As a result, VM internal timer data structures could become inconsistent when using 1024 schedulers on the system. Note that systems with less than 1024 schedulers are not effected by this bug.\n\nThis bug was introduced in ERTS version 7.0 (OTP 18.0).\n\n"

        release_note: "Automatic cleanup of a BIF timer, when the owner process terminated, could race with the timeout of the timer. This could cause the VM internal data structures to become inconsistent which very likely caused a VM crash.\n\nThis bug was introduced in ERTS version 9.0 (OTP 20.0).\n\n"
