Printouts made with io:format/2 and ct:pal/2 will now get special characters escaped automatically. Common Test will not attempt to escape characters printed with ct:log/2 since it is assumed that the user may want to print html tagged data using this function. A new function, ct:log/5, has been added, which offers optional escaping of characters. The latter function may also be used to print text to the log without headers and CSS class wrapping (analogue to io:format/2).\n\n"
