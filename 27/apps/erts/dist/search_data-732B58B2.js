One valid `Item`\n  exists in combination with the `time_offset Type`, namely the atom\n  `clock_service`. Notice that the atom `clock_service` is _not_ the registered\n  name of a process. In this case it serves as an identifier of the runtime\n  system internal clock service at current runtime system instance.\n\n  The monitor is triggered when the time offset is changed. This either if the\n  time offset value is changed, or if the offset is changed from preliminary to\n  final during\n  [finalization of the time offset](#system_flag_time_offset) when the\n  [single time warp mode](time_correction.md#single-time-warp-mode) is used.\n  When a change from preliminary to final time offset is made, the monitor is\n  triggered once regardless of whether the time offset value was changed or not.\n\n  If the runtime system is in\n  [multi time warp mode](time_correction.md#multi-time-warp-mode), the time\n  offset is changed when the runtime system detects that the\n  [OS system time](time_correction.md#os-system-time) has changed. The runtime\n  system does, however, not detect this immediately when it occurs. A task\n  checking the time offset is scheduled to execute at least once a minute, so\n  under normal operation this is to be detected within a minute, but during\n  heavy load it can take longer time.\n\n  The monitor is _not_ automatically removed after it has been triggered. That\n  is, repeated changes of the time offset trigger the monitor repeatedly.\n\n  When the monitor is triggered a `'CHANGE'` message is sent to the monitoring\n  process. A `'CHANGE'` message has the following pattern:\n\n  ```erlang\n  {'CHANGE', MonitorRef, Type, Item, NewTimeOffset}\n  ```\n\n  where `MonitorRef`, `Type`, and `Item` are the same as described above, and\n  `NewTimeOffset` is the new time offset.\n\n  When the `'CHANGE'` message has been received you are guaranteed not to\n  retrieve the old time offset when calling\n  `erlang:time_offset/0`. Notice that you can observe the\n  change of the time offset when calling `erlang:time_offset/0` before you get\n  the `'CHANGE'` message.\n\n  Available since OTP 18.0.\n\nMaking several calls to `monitor/2` for the same `Item` and/or\n`Type` is not an error; it results in as many independent monitoring instances.\n\nThe monitor functionality is expected to be extended.

That is, the returned reference can be used for\n  sending messages to the calling process. See also `alias/0`. The `UnaliasOpt`\n  determines how the alias should be deactivated.\n\n  - **`explicit_unalias`** - Only an explicit call to `unalias/1` will\n    deactivate the alias.\n\n  - **`demonitor`** - The alias will be automatically deactivated when the\n    monitor is removed. This either via an explicit call to `demonitor/1` or\n    when it is automatically removed at the same time as a `'DOWN'` message is\n    delivered due to the monitor.

If found, that\n  driver is started. A driver runs in the Erlang work space, which means that it\n  is linked with the Erlang runtime system.\n\n  For external programs, `PATH` is searched (or an equivalent method is used to\n  find programs, depending on the OS). This is done by invoking the shell on\n  certain platforms. The first space-separated token of the command is\n  considered as the name of the executable (or driver). This (among other\n  things) makes this option unsuitable for running programs with spaces in\n  filenames or directory names. If spaces in executable filenames are desired,\n  use `{spawn_executable, Command}` instead.\n\n  > #### Warning {: .warning }\n  >\n  > On Unix systems, arguments are passed to a new operating system process as\n  > an array of strings but on Windows it is up to the child process to parse\n  > them and some Windows programs may apply their own rules, which are\n  > inconsistent with the standard C runtime `argv` parsing.\n  >\n  > This is particularly troublesome when invoking `.bat`, `.cmd`, or `.com`\n  > files as these run implicitly through `cmd.exe`, whose argument parsing is\n  > vulnerable to malicious input and can be used to run arbitrary shell\n  > commands.\n  >\n  > Therefore, if you are running on Windows and you execute batch files or\n  > `.com` applications, you must not pass untrusted input as arguments to the\n  > program. This affects both `spawn` and `spawn_executable`.\n\n- **`{spawn_executable, FileName}`** - Works like `{spawn, FileName}`, but only\n  runs external executables. `FileName` in its whole is used as the name of the\n  executable, including any spaces. If arguments are to be passed, the\n  `PortSettings` `args` and `arg0` can be used.\n\n  The shell is usually not invoked to start the program, it is executed\n  directly. `PATH` (or equivalent) is not searched. To find a program in `PATH`\n  to execute, use `os:find_executable/1`.\n\n  Only if a shell script or `.bat` file is executed, the appropriate command\n  interpreter is invoked implicitly, but there is still no command-argument\n  expansion or implicit `PATH` search.\n\n  If `FileName` cannot be run, an error exception is raised, with the POSIX\n  error code as the reason. The error reason can differ between OSs. Typically\n  the error `enoent` is raised when an attempt is made to run a program that is\n  not found and `eacces` is raised when the specified file is not executable.\n\n- **`{spawn_driver, Command}`** - Works like `{spawn, Command}`, but demands the\n  first (space-separated) token of the command to be the name of a loaded\n  driver. If no driver with that name is loaded, a `badarg` error is raised.\n\n- **`{fd, In, Out}`** - Allows an Erlang process to access any currently opened\n  file descriptors used by Erlang. The file descriptor `In` can be used for\n  standard input, and the file descriptor `Out` for standard output. It is only\n  used for various servers in the Erlang OS (`shell` and `user`). Hence, its use\n  is limited.\n\n`PortSettings` is a list of settings for the port. The valid settings are as\nfollows:\n\n- **`{packet, N}`** - Messages are preceded by their length, sent in `N` bytes,\n  with the most significant byte first. The valid values for `N` are 1, 2,\n  and 4.\n\n- **`stream`** - Output messages are sent without packet lengths. A user-defined\n  protocol must be used between the Erlang process and the external object.\n\n- **`{line, L}`** - Messages are delivered on a per line basis. Each line\n  (delimited by the OS-dependent newline sequence) is delivered in a single\n  message. The message data format is `{Flag, Line}`, where `Flag` is `eol` or\n  `noeol`, and `Line` is the data delivered (without the newline sequence).\n\n  `L` specifies the maximum line length in bytes. Lines longer than this are\n  delivered in more than one message, with `Flag` set to `noeol` for all but the\n  last message. If end of file is encountered anywhere else than immediately\n  following a newline sequence, the last line is also delivered with `Flag` set\n  to `noeol`. Otherwise lines are delivered with `Flag` set to `eol`.\n\n  The `{packet, N}` and `{line, L}` settings are mutually exclusive.\n\n- **`{cd, Dir}`** - Only valid for `{spawn, Command}` and\n  `{spawn_executable, FileName}`. The external program starts using `Dir` as its\n  working directory. `Dir` must be a string.\n\n- **`{env, Env}`** - Only valid for `{spawn, Command}`, and `{spawn_executable, FileName}`.\n  The environment of the started process is extended using the environment\n  specifications in `Env`.\n\n  `Env` is to be a list of tuples `{Name, Val}`, where `Name` is a `t:os:env_var_name/0`\n  representing the name of an environment variable, and `Val` is a `t:os:env_var_name/0`\n  representing the value it is to have in the spawned port process. Both `Name` and `Val` must\n  be strings.\n\n  If `Val` is set to the atom `false` or the empty string (that is `\"\"` or `[]`), open_port\n  will consider those variables unset just as if `os:unsetenv/1` had been called.\n\n  For information about encoding requirements, see documentation of the types\n  for `Name` and `Val`.\n\n- **`{args, [ string() | binary() ]}`** - Only valid for\n  `{spawn_executable, FileName}` and specifies arguments to the executable. Each\n  argument is specified as a separate string and (on Unix) eventually ends up as\n  one element each in the argument vector. On other platforms, a similar\n  behavior is mimicked.\n\n  The arguments are not expanded by the shell before they are supplied to the\n  executable. Most notably this means that file wildcard expansion does not\n  occur. To expand wildcards for the arguments, use `filelib:wildcard/1`. Notice\n  that even if the program is a Unix shell script, meaning that the shell\n  ultimately is invoked, wildcard expansion does not occur, and the script is\n  provided with the untouched arguments. On Windows, wildcard expansion is\n  always up to the program itself, therefore this is not an issue.\n\n  The executable name (also known as `argv[0]`) is not to be specified in this\n  list. The proper executable name is automatically used as `argv[0]`, where\n  applicable.\n\n  If you explicitly want to set the program name in the argument vector, option\n  `arg0` can be used.\n\n- **`{arg0, string() | binary()}`** - Only valid for\n  `{spawn_executable, FileName}` and explicitly specifies the program name\n  argument when running an executable. This can in some circumstances, on some\n  OSs, be desirable. How the program responds to this is highly system-dependent\n  and no specific effect is guaranteed.\n\n- **`exit_status`** - Only valid for `{spawn, Command}`, where `Command` refers\n  to an external program, and for `{spawn_executable, FileName}`.\n\n  When the external process connected to the port exits, a message of the form\n  `{Port,{exit_status,Status}}` is sent to the connected process, where `Status`\n  is the exit status of the external process. If the program aborts on Unix, the\n  same convention is used as the shells do (that is, 128+signal).\n\n  If option `eof` is specified also, the messages `eof` and `exit_status` appear\n  in an unspecified order.\n\n- **`use_stdio`** - Only valid for `{spawn, Command}` and\n  `{spawn_executable, FileName}`. It allows the standard input and output (file\n  descriptors 0 and 1) of the spawned (Unix) process for communication with\n  Erlang.\n\n- **`nouse_stdio`** - The opposite of `use_stdio`. It uses file descriptors 3\n  and 4 for communication with Erlang.\n\n- **`stderr_to_stdout`** - Affects ports to external programs. The executed\n  program gets its standard error file redirected to its standard output file.\n  `stderr_to_stdout` and `nouse_stdio` are mutually exclusive.\n\n- **`overlapped_io`** - Affects ports to external programs on Windows only. The\n  standard input and standard output handles of the port program are, if this\n  option is supplied, opened with flag `FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED`, so that the port\n  program can (and must) do overlapped I/O on its standard handles. This is not\n  normally the case for simple port programs, but an option of value for the\n  experienced Windows programmer. _On all other platforms, this option is\n  silently discarded._\n\n- **`in`** - The port can only be used for input.\n\n- **`out`** - The port can only be used for output.\n\n- **`binary`** - All I/O from the port is binary data objects as opposed to\n  lists of bytes.\n\n- **`eof`** - The port is not closed at the end of the file and does not produce\n  an exit signal. Instead, it remains open and a `{Port, eof}` message is sent\n  to the process holding the port.\n\n- **`hide`** - When running on Windows, suppresses creation of a new console\n  window when spawning the port program. (This option has no effect on other\n  platforms.)\n\n- **`{parallelism, Boolean}`** - [](){: #open_port_parallelism } Sets scheduler\n  hint for port parallelism. If set to `true`, the virtual machine schedules\n  port tasks; when doing so, it improves parallelism in the system. If set to\n  `false`, the virtual machine tries to perform port tasks immediately,\n  improving latency at the expense of parallelism. The default can be set at\n  system startup by passing command-line argument [`+spp`](erl_cmd.md#%2Bspp) to\n  [erl](erl_cmd.md).\n\n- **`{busy_limits_port, {Low, High} | disabled}`** - Sets limits that will be\n  used for controlling the busy state of the port.\n\n  When the ports internal output queue size becomes larger than or equal to\n  `High` bytes, it enters the busy state. When it becomes less than `Low` bytes\n  it leaves the busy state. When the port is in the busy state, processes\n  sending commands to it will be suspended until the port leaves the busy state.\n  Commands are in this context either `Port ! {Owner, {command, Data}}` or\n  `port_command/[2,3]`.\n\n  The `Low` limit is automatically adjusted to the same as `High` if it is set\n  larger then `High`. Valid range of values for `Low` and `High` is\n  `[1, (1 bsl (8*erlang:system_info(wordsize)))-2]`. If the atom `disabled` is\n  passed, the port will never enter the busy state.\n\n  The defaults are `Low = 4096` and `High = 8192`.\n\n  _Note_ that this option is only valid when spawning an executable (port\n  program) by opening the spawn driver and when opening the `fd` driver. This\n  option will cause a failure with a `badarg` exception when opening other\n  drivers.\n\n- **`{busy_limits_msgq, {Low, High} | disabled}`** - Sets limits that will be\n  used for controlling the busy state of the port message queue.\n\n  When the ports message queue size becomes larger than or equal to `High` bytes\n  it enters the busy state. When it becomes less than `Low` bytes it leaves the\n  busy state. When the port message queue is in the busy state, processes\n  sending commands to it will be suspended until the port message queue leaves\n  the busy state. Commands are in this context either\n  `Port ! {Owner, {command, Data}}` or `port_command/[2,3]`.\n\n  The `Low` limit is automatically adjusted to the same as `High` if it is set\n  larger then `High`. Valid range of values for `Low` and `High` is\n  `[1, (1 bsl (8*erlang:system_info(wordsize)))-2]`. If the atom `disabled` is\n  passed, the port message queue will never enter the busy state.\n\n  _Note_ that if the driver statically has disabled the use of this feature, a\n  failure with a `badarg` exception will be raised unless this option also is\n  set to `disable` or not passed at all.\n\n  The defaults are `Low = 4096` and `High = 8192` unless the driver itself does\n  modifications of these values.\n\n  _Note_ that the driver might fail if it also adjust these limits by itself and\n  you have disabled this feature.\n\n  The spawn driver (used when spawning an executable) and the `fd` driver do not\n  disable this feature and do not adjust these limits by themselves.\n\n  For more information see the documentation\n  [`erl_drv_busy_msgq_limits()`](erl_driver.md#erl_drv_busy_msgq_limits).\n\nDefault is `stream` for all port types and `use_stdio` for spawned ports.\n\nFailure: if the port cannot be opened, the exit reason is `badarg`,\n`system_limit`, or the POSIX error code that most closely describes the error,\nor `einval` if no POSIX code is appropriate:\n\n- **`badarg`** - Bad input arguments to `open_port`.\n\n- **`system_limit`** - All available ports in the Erlang emulator are in use.\n\n- **`enomem`** - Not enough memory to create the port.\n\n- **`eagain`** - No more available OS processes.\n\n- **`enametoolong`** - Too long external command.\n\n- **`emfile`** - No more available file descriptors (for the OS process that the\n  Erlang emulator runs in).\n\n- **`enfile`** - Full file table (for the entire OS).\n\n- **`eacces`** - `Command` specified in `{spawn_executable, Command}` does not\n  point out an executable file.\n\n- **`enoent`** - `FileName` specified in `{spawn_executable, FileName}` does not\n  point out an existing file.\n\nDuring use of a port opened using `{spawn, Name}`, `{spawn_driver, Name}`, or\n`{spawn_executable, Name}`, errors arising when sending messages to it are\nreported to the owning process using signals of the form\n`{'EXIT', Port, PosixCode}`.

The default system default is `false`. It can be changed by either the\n    option [\\+hmaxib](erl_cmd.md#%2Bhmaxib) in [erl](erl_cmd.md), or\n    [`erlang:system_flag(max_heap_size, MaxHeapSize)`](#system_flag_max_heap_size).\n  \n  The heap size of a process is quite hard to predict, especially the amount of\n  memory that is used during the garbage collection. When contemplating using this\n  option, it is recommended to first run it in production with `kill` set to\n  `false` and inspect the log events to see what the normal peak sizes of the\n  processes in the system is and then tune the value accordingly.\n  \n- ```erlang\n  process_flag(message_queue_data, message_queue_data())\n  ```\n  {: #process_flag_message_queue_data }\n  \n  Determines how messages in the message queue are stored, as follows:\n  \n  - **`off_heap`** - _All_ messages in the message queue will be stored outside\n    the process heap. This implies that _no_ messages in the message queue will be\n    part of a garbage collection of the process.\n  \n  - **`on_heap`** - All messages in the message queue will eventually be placed on\n    the process heap. They can, however, be temporarily stored off the heap. This\n    is how messages have always been stored up until ERTS 8.0.\n  \n  The default value of the `message_queue_data` process flag is determined by the\n  command-line argument [`+hmqd`](erl_cmd.md#%2Bhmqd) in [erl](erl_cmd.md).\n  \n  If the process may potentially accumulate a large number of messages in its\n  queue it is recommended to set the flag value to `off_heap`. This is due to the\n  fact that the garbage collection of a process that has a large number of\n  messages stored on the heap can become extremely expensive and the process can\n  consume large amounts of memory. The performance of the actual message passing\n  is, however, generally better when the flag value is `on_heap`.\n  \n  Changing the flag value causes any existing messages to be moved. The move\n  operation is initiated, but not necessarily completed, by the time the function\n  returns.\n  \n- ```erlang\n  process_flag(priority, priority_level())\n  ```\n  {: #process_flag_priority }\n  \n  Sets the process priority. `Level` is an atom. Four priority levels exist:\n  `low`, `normal`, `high`, and `max`. Default is `normal`.\n  \n  > #### Note {: .info }\n  >\n  > Priority level `max` is reserved for internal use in the Erlang runtime\n  > system, and is _not_ to be used by others.\n  \n  Internally in each priority level, processes are scheduled in a round robin\n  fashion.\n  \n  Execution of processes on priority `normal` and `low` are interleaved. Processes\n  on priority `low` are selected for execution less frequently than processes on\n  priority `normal`.\n  \n  When runnable processes on priority `high` exist, no processes on priority `low`\n  or `normal` are selected for execution. Notice however that this does _not_ mean\n  that no processes on priority `low` or `normal` can run when processes are\n  running on priority `high`. When using multiple schedulers, more processes can\n  be running in parallel than processes on priority `high`. That is, a `low` and a\n  `high` priority process can execute at the same time.\n  \n  When runnable processes on priority `max` exist, no processes on priority `low`,\n  `normal`, or `high` are selected for execution. As with priority `high`,\n  processes on lower priorities can execute in parallel with processes on priority\n  `max`.\n  \n  Scheduling is pre-emptive. Regardless of priority, a process is pre-empted when\n  it has consumed more than a certain number of reductions since the last time it\n  was selected for execution.\n  \n  > #### Note {: .info }\n  >\n  > Do not depend on the scheduling to remain exactly as it is today. Scheduling\n  > is likely to be changed in a future release to use available processor cores\n  > better.\n  \n  There is _no_ automatic mechanism for avoiding priority inversion, such as\n  priority inheritance or priority ceilings. When using priorities, take this into\n  account and handle such scenarios by yourself.\n  \n  Making calls from a `high` priority process into code that you has no control\n  over can cause the `high` priority process to wait for a process with lower\n  priority. That is, effectively decreasing the priority of the `high` priority\n  process during the call. Even if this is not the case with one version of the\n  code that you have no control over, it can be the case in a future version of\n  it. This can, for example, occur if a `high` priority process triggers code\n  loading, as the code server runs on priority `normal`.\n  \n  Other priorities than `normal` are normally not needed. When other priorities\n  are used, use them with care, _especially_ priority `high`. A process on\n  priority `high` is only to perform work for short periods. Busy looping for long\n  periods in a `high` priority process causes most likely problems, as important\n  OTP servers run on priority `normal`.\n  \n- ```erlang\n  process_flag(save_calls, 0..10000)\n  ```\n  \n  `N` must be an integer in the interval 0..10000. If `N` > 0, call saving is made\n  active for the process.

Setting the number to zero disables the general collection\n  algorithm, that is, all live data is copied at every garbage collection.\n\n  A few cases when it can be useful to change `fullsweep_after`:\n\n  - If binaries that are no longer used are to be thrown away as soon as\n    possible. (Set `Number` to zero.)\n  - A process that mostly have short-lived data is fullsweeped seldom or never,\n    that is, the old heap contains mostly garbage. To ensure a fullsweep\n    occasionally, set `Number` to a suitable value, such as 10 or 20.\n  - In embedded systems with a limited amount of RAM and no virtual memory, you\n    might want to preserve memory by setting `Number` to zero.

Setting this value higher than the system\n  default can speed up some processes because less garbage collection is done.\n  However, setting a too high value can waste memory and slow down the system\n  because of worse data locality.

It is designed to be as lightweight as\n  possible, but some overhead exists when this is enabled. Microstate accounting\n  is meant to be a profiling tool to help finding performance bottlenecks. To\n  `start`/`stop`/`reset` microstate accounting, use system flag\n  [`microstate_accounting`](#system_flag_microstate_accounting).\n\n  [`statistics(microstate_accounting)`](`statistics/1`) returns a list of maps\n  representing some of the OS threads within ERTS. Each map contains `type` and\n  `id` fields that can be used to identify what thread it is, and also a counters\n  field that contains data about how much time has been spent in the various\n  states.\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```erlang\n  > erlang:statistics(microstate_accounting).\n  [#{counters => #{aux => 1899182914,\n                   check_io => 2605863602,\n                   emulator => 45731880463,\n                   gc => 1512206910,\n                   other => 5421338456,\n                   port => 221631,\n                   sleep => 5150294100},\n     id => 1,\n     type => scheduler}|...]\n  ```\n\n  The time unit is the same as returned by `os:perf_counter/0`. So, to convert it\n  to milliseconds, you can do something like this:\n\n  ```erlang\n  lists:map(\n    fun(#{ counters := Cnt } = M) ->\n           MsCnt = maps:map(fun(_K, PerfCount) ->\n                                      erlang:convert_time_unit(PerfCount, perf_counter, 1000)\n                             end, Cnt),\n           M#{ counters := MsCnt }\n    end, erlang:statistics(microstate_accounting)).\n  ```\n\n  Notice that these values are not guaranteed to be the exact time spent in each\n  state. This is because of various optimisation done to keep the overhead as\n  small as possible.\n\n  `MSAcc_Thread_Type`s:\n\n  - **`scheduler`** - The main execution threads that do most of the work. See\n    [erl +S](erl_cmd.md#%2BS) for more details.\n\n  - **`dirty_cpu_scheduler`** - The threads for long running cpu intensive work.\n    See [erl +SDcpu](erl_cmd.md#%2BSDcpu) for more details.\n\n  - **`dirty_io_scheduler`** - The threads for long running I/O work. See\n    [erl +SDio](erl_cmd.md#%2BSDio) for more details.\n\n  - **`async`** - Async threads are used by various linked-in drivers (mainly the\n    file drivers) do offload non-CPU intensive work. See\n    [erl +A](erl_cmd.md#async_thread_pool_size) for more details.\n\n  - **`aux`** - Takes care of any work that is not specifically assigned to a\n    scheduler.\n\n  - **`poll`** - Does the IO polling for the emulator. See\n    [erl +IOt](erl_cmd.md#%2BIOt) for more details.\n\n  The following `MSAcc_Thread_State`s are available. All states are exclusive,\n  meaning that a thread cannot be in two states at once. So, if you add the\n  numbers of all counters in a thread, you get the total runtime for that thread.\n\n  - **`aux`** - Time spent handling auxiliary jobs.\n\n  - **`check_io`** - Time spent checking for new I/O events.\n\n  - **`emulator`** - Time spent executing Erlang processes.\n\n  - **`gc`** - Time spent doing garbage collection. When extra states are enabled\n    this is the time spent doing non-fullsweep garbage collections.\n\n  - **`other`** - Time spent doing unaccounted things.\n\n  - **`port`** - Time spent executing ports.\n\n  - **`sleep`** - Time spent sleeping.\n\n  More fine-grained `MSAcc_Thread_State`s can be added through configure (such as\n  `./configure --with-microstate-accounting=extra`). Enabling these states causes\n  performance degradation when microstate accounting is turned off and increases\n  the overhead when it is turned on.\n\n  - **`alloc`** - Time spent managing memory. Without extra states this time is\n    spread out over all other states.\n\n  - **`bif`** - Time spent in BIFs. Without extra states this time is part of the\n    `emulator` state.\n\n  - **`busy_wait`** - Time spent busy waiting. This is also the state where a\n    scheduler no longer reports that it is active when using\n    [`statistics(scheduler_wall_time)`](#statistics_scheduler_wall_time).\n    So, if you add all other states but this and sleep, and then divide that by\n    all time in the thread, you should get something very similar to the\n    `scheduler_wall_time` fraction. Without extra states this time is part of the\n    `other` state.\n\n  - **`ets`** - Time spent executing ETS BIFs. Without extra states this time is\n    part of the `emulator` state.\n\n  - **`gc_full`** - Time spent doing fullsweep garbage collection. Without extra\n    states this time is part of the `gc` state.\n\n  - **`nif`** - Time spent in NIFs. Without extra states this time is part of the\n    `emulator` state.\n\n  - **`send`** - Time spent sending messages (processes only). Without extra\n    states this time is part of the `emulator` state.\n\n  - **`timers`** - Time spent managing timers.

The time unit returned is undefined and can be\n  subject to change between releases, OSs, and system restarts.\n  `scheduler_wall_time` is only to be used to calculate relative values for\n  scheduler utilization.

You are recommended to use a much\n  smaller value for `Disable` length than `Enable` length in order not to be\n  flooded with `long_message_queue` monitor messages.\n\n- **`{long_schedule, Time}`** - If a process or port in the system runs\n  uninterrupted for at least `Time` wall clock milliseconds, a message\n  `{monitor, PidOrPort, long_schedule, Info}` is sent to `MonitorPid`.\n  `PidOrPort` is the process or port that was running. `Info` is a list of\n  two-element tuples describing the event.\n\n  If a `t:pid/0`, the tuples `{timeout, Millis}`, `{in, Location}`, and\n  `{out, Location}` are present, where `Location` is either an MFA\n  (`{Module, Function, Arity}`) describing the function where the process was\n  scheduled in/out, or the atom `undefined`.\n\n  If a `t:port/0`, the tuples `{timeout, Millis}` and `{port_op,Op}` are\n  present. `Op` is one of `proc_sig`, `timeout`, `input`, `output`, `event`, or\n  `dist_cmd`, depending on which driver callback was executing.\n\n  `proc_sig` is an internal operation and is never to appear, while the others\n  represent the corresponding driver callbacks `timeout`, `ready_input`,\n  `ready_output`, `event`, and `outputv` (when the port is used by\n  distribution). Value `Millis` in tuple `timeout` informs about the\n  uninterrupted execution time of the process or port, which always is equal to\n  or higher than the `Time` value supplied when starting the trace. New tuples\n  can be added to the `Info` list in a future release. The order of the tuples\n  in the list can be changed at any time without prior notice.\n\n  This can be used to detect problems with NIFs or drivers that take too long to\n  execute. 1 ms is considered a good maximum time for a driver callback or a\n  NIF. However, a time-sharing system is usually to consider everything < 100 ms\n  as \"possible\" and fairly \"normal\". However, longer schedule times can indicate\n  swapping or a misbehaving NIF/driver. Misbehaving NIFs and drivers can cause\n  bad resource utilization and bad overall system performance.\n\n- **`{large_heap, Size}`** - If a garbage collection in the system results in\n  the allocated size of a heap being at least `Size` words, a message\n  `{monitor, GcPid, large_heap, Info}` is sent to `MonitorPid`. `GcPid` and\n  `Info` are the same as for `long_gc` earlier, except that the tuple tagged\n  with `timeout` is not present.\n\n  The monitor message is sent if the sum of the sizes of all memory blocks\n  allocated for all heap generations after a garbage collection is equal to or\n  higher than `Size`.\n\n  When a process is killed by\n  [`max_heap_size`](#process_flag_max_heap_size), it is killed before\n  the garbage collection is complete and thus no large heap message is sent.\n\n- **`busy_port`** - If a process in the system gets suspended because it sends\n  to a busy port, a message `{monitor, SusPid, busy_port, Port}` is sent to\n  `MonitorPid`. `SusPid` is the pid that got suspended when sending to `Port`.\n\n- **`busy_dist_port`[](){: #busy_dist_port } **  \n   If a process in the system gets suspended because it sends to a process on a remote\n  node whose inter-node communication was handled by a busy port, a message `{monitor, SusPid, busy_dist_port, Port}`\n  is sent to `MonitorPid`. `SusPid` is the pid that got suspended when sending through\n  the inter-node communication port `Port`.\n\nReturns the previous system monitor settings just like\n[`erlang:system_monitor/0`](`system_monitor/0`).\n\nThe arguments to [`system_monitor/2`](`system_monitor/2`) specifies how all\nsystem monitoring on the node should be done, not how it should be changed. This\nmeans only one process at a time (`MonitorPid`) can be the receiver of system\nmonitor messages. Also, the way to clear a specific monitor option is to not\ninclude it in the list `Options`. All system monitoring will, however, be\ncleared if the process identified by `MonitorPid` terminates.\n\nThere are no special option values (like zero) to clear an option. Some of the\noptions have a unspecified minimum value. Lower values will be adjusted to the\nminimum value. For example, it is currently not possible to monitor all garbage\ncollections with `{long_gc, 0}`.\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> If a monitoring process gets so large that it itself starts to cause system\n> monitor messages when garbage collecting, the messages enlarge the process\n> message queue and probably make the problem worse.\n>\n> Keep the monitoring process neat and do not set the system monitor limits too\n> tight.\n\nFailures:\n\n- **`badarg`** - If `MonitorPid` does not exist.\n\n- **`badarg`** - If `MonitorPid` is not a local process.","ref":"erlang.html#system_monitor/2"},{"type":"type","title":"erlang.system_monitor_option/0","doc":"","ref":"erlang.html#t:system_monitor_option/0"},{"type":"function","title":"erlang.system_profile/0","doc":"Returns the current system profiling settings set by\n[`erlang:system_profile/2`](`system_profile/2`) as `{ProfilerPid, Options}`, or\n`undefined` if there are no settings.

This since such identifiers refer to a specific node by node name\n  and creation.\n\n  Node name and creation of a runtime system instance change when the\n  distribution is started or stopped. The distribution is started when the\n  runtime system is started using the [`-name`](erl_cmd.md#name) or\n  [`-sname`](erl_cmd.md#sname) command line arguments. Note that the actual\n  start of the distribution happens after other code in the startup phase has\n  begun executing. The distribution can also be started by calling\n  `net_kernel:start/2` and stopped by calling\n  [`net_kernel:stop/1`](`net_kernel:stop/0`) if it has not been started via the\n  command line.\n\n  The decoding of a term encoded with the `local` option, using for example\n  [`binary_to_term()`](`term_to_binary/1`), will try to verify that the term\n  actually was encoded by the same runtime system instance, and will in the vast\n  majority of cases fail if the encoding was performed by another runtime system\n  instance. You should however _not_ trust that this verification will work in\n  all cases. You _should_ make sure to _only_ decode terms encoded with the\n  `local` option on the same Erlang runtime system instance as the one that\n  encoded the terms.\n\n  Since it is only the runtime system that encoded a term using the `local`\n  option that can decode it, the local encoding is typically pieced together\n  with something else to produce a reply to where the `local` encoding\n  originates from. If a term encoded using the `local` option is stripped of its\n  leading version number, it can be added as part of a larger term (for example\n  as an element in a tuple) when encoding on the external term format using, for\n  example, [ei](`e:erl_interface:ei.md`). In the `ei` case, you would strip it\n  of the version number using\n  [`ei_decode_version()`](`e:erl_interface:ei.md#ei_decode_version`) and then\n  add the remaining local encoding to what you are encoding using for example\n  [`ei_x_append_buf()`](`e:erl_interface:ei.md#ei_x_append_buf`).\n\n  A good example of when you want to use the `local` option, is when you want to\n  make a request from a process to a port [driver](erl_driver.md) and utilize\n  the\n  [selective receive optimization](`e:system:eff_guide_processes.md#receiving-messages`)\n  when receiving the reply. In this scenario you want to create a reference,\n  serialize the reference on the external term format using the `local` option,\n  pass this to the driver in the request, and then wait for the reply message in\n  a selective receive matching on the reference. The driver should send the\n  reply using either\n  [`erl_drv_output_term()`](erl_driver.md#erl_drv_output_term) or\n  [`erl_drv_send_term()`](erl_driver.md#erl_drv_send_term) using the term type\n  [`ERL_DRV_EXT2TERM`](erl_driver.md#ERL_DRV_EXT2TERM) for the, in the request,\n  previously received reference on the external term format. Note that you\n  should not strip the leading version number from the local encoding when using\n  the term type `ERL_DRV_EXT2TERM` of this functionality. If you in this example\n  do not encode the reference using the `local` option, and the distribution is\n  started or stopped while the request is ongoing, the process that made the\n  request will hang indefinitely since the reference in the reply message will\n  never match.\n\n  This option cannot be combined with the `deterministic` option.\n\n  For more information see the [`LOCAL_EXT`](erl_ext_dist.md#local_ext) tag in\n  the documentation of the external term format.\n\nSee also `binary_to_term/1`.","ref":"erlang.html#term_to_binary/2"},{"type":"function","title":"erlang.term_to_iovec/1","doc":"Returns the encoding of `Term` according to the Erlang external term format as\n`t:ext_iovec/0`.\n\nThis function produce the same encoding as `term_to_binary/1`, but with another\nreturn type.

When a persistent term is updated or deleted, a\nglobal garbage collection pass is run to scan all processes for the deleted\nterm, and to copy it into each process that still uses it. Therefore,\n`persistent_term` is suitable for storing Erlang terms that are frequently\naccessed but never or infrequently updated.\n\n> #### Warning {: .warning }\n>\n> Persistent terms is an advanced feature and is not a general replacement for\n> ETS tables. Before using persistent terms, make sure to fully understand the\n> consequence to system performance when updating or deleting persistent terms.\n\nTerm lookup (using `get/1`) is done in constant time and without taking any\nlocks, and the term is **not** copied to the heap (as is the case with terms\nstored in ETS tables).\n\nStoring or updating a term (using `put/2`) is proportional to the number of\nalready created persistent terms because the hash table holding the keys will be\ncopied. In addition, the term itself will be copied.\n\nWhen a (complex) term is deleted (using `erase/1`) or replaced by another (using\n`put/2`), a global garbage collection is initiated. It works like this:\n\n- All processes in the system will be scheduled to run a scan of their heaps for\n  the term that has been deleted. While such scan is relatively light-weight, if\n  there are many processes, the system can become less responsive until all\n  processes have scanned their heaps.\n- If the deleted term (or any part of it) is still used by a process, that\n  process will do a major (fullsweep) garbage collection and copy the term into\n  the process. However, at most two processes at a time will be scheduled to do\n  that kind of garbage collection.\n\nDeletion of atoms and other terms that fit in one machine word is specially\noptimized to avoid doing a global GC. It is still not recommended to update\npersistent terms with such values too frequently because the hash table holding\nthe keys is copied every time a persistent term is updated.\n\nSome examples are suitable uses for persistent terms are:\n\n- Storing of configuration data that must be easily accessible by all processes.\n- Storing of references for NIF resources.\n- Storing of references for efficient counters.\n- Storing an atom to indicate a logging level or whether debugging is turned on.","ref":"persistent_term.html"},{"type":"module","title":"Storing Huge Persistent Terms - persistent_term","doc":"The current implementation of persistent terms uses the literal\n[allocator](erts_alloc.md) also used for literals (constant terms) in BEAM code.\nBy default, 1 GB of virtual address space is reserved for literals in BEAM code\nand persistent terms.

The execution time for storing a persistent term is proportional to the\nnumber of already existing terms.\n\nUpdating a persistent term with the same value as it already has is specially\noptimized to do nothing quickly; thus, there is no need compare the old and new\nvalues and avoid calling `put/2` if the values are equal.\n\nWhen atoms or other terms that fit in one machine word are deleted, no global GC\nis needed. Therefore, persistent terms that have atoms as their values can be\nupdated more frequently, but note that updating such persistent terms is still\nmuch more expensive than reading them.\n\nUpdating or deleting a persistent term will trigger a global GC if the term does\nnot fit in one machine word. Processes will be scheduled as usual, but all\nprocesses will be made runnable at once, which will make the system less\nresponsive until all processes have run and scanned their heaps for the deleted\nterms. One way to minimize the effects on responsiveness could be to minimize\nthe number of processes on the node before updating or deleting a persistent\nterm. It would also be wise to avoid updating terms when the system is at peak\nload.\n\nAvoid storing a retrieved persistent term in a process if that persistent term\ncould be deleted or updated in the future. If a process holds a reference to a\npersistent term when the term is deleted, the process will be garbage collected\nand the term copied to the process.\n\nAvoid updating or deleting more than one persistent term at a time. Each deleted\nterm will trigger its own global GC. That means that deleting N terms will make\nthe system less responsive N times longer than deleting a single persistent\nterm.

The effect on\n  other applications that expects that a fully connected network is maintained\n  may vary, but they might misbehave in very subtle hard to detect ways during\n  such a partitioning.\n\n  In order to prevent such issues, we have introduced a _prevent overlapping\n  partitions_ fix which can be enabled using the\n  [`prevent_overlapping_partitions`](`e:kernel:kernel_app.md#prevent_overlapping_partitions`)\n  `kernel(6)` parameter. When this fix has been enabled, `global` will actively\n  disconnect from nodes that reports that they have lost connections to other\n  nodes. This will cause fully connected partitions to form instead of leaving\n  the network in a state with overlapping partitions. Note that this fix _has_\n  to be enabled on _all_ nodes in the network in order to work properly.

It is introduced in order to provide a lightweight mechanism that\n  can prevent late replies after timeout or connection loss. For more\n  information, see EEP 53 and the documentation of the new\n  [`alias/1`](`erlang:alias/1`) BIF and the new options to the\n  [`monitor/3`](`erlang:monitor/3`) BIF.\n\n  The `call` operation in the framework used by `gen_server`, `gen_statem`, and\n  `gen_event` has been updated to utilize alias in order to prevent late\n  responses. The `gen_statem` behavior still use a proxy process in the\n  distributed case, since it has always prevented late replies and aliases won't\n  work against pre OTP 24 nodes. The proxy process can be removed in OTP 26.\n\n  The alias feature also made it possible to introduce new functions similar to\n  the [`erpc:receive_response()`](`erpc:receive_response/2`) function in the gen\n  behaviors, so the new functions\n  [`gen_server:receive_response()`](`gen_server:receive_response/2`),\n  [`gen_statem:receive_response()`](`gen_statem:receive_response/2`),\n  [`gen_event:receive_response()`](`gen_event:receive_response/2`) have also\n  been introduced.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-16718 Aux Id: PR-2735\n\n- Accept 64-bit process identifiers from external nodes.

The JIT-compiler is\n  enabled by default on most x86 64-bit platforms that have a C++ compiler that\n  can compile C++17.

This was the default behavior between OTP 17 and\n  OTP 21, but changed to use a node global carrier pool as of OTP 22.0. Usage of\n  the node global carrier pool proved troublesome since it had a tendency to\n  spread long lived blocks into allocators with normally short lived blocks\n  causing increased memory fragmentation. The node global carrier pool behavior\n  as well as other behaviors can be configured using the\n  [`+M cp`](erts_alloc.md#M_cp) command line argument.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-16898 Aux Id: OTP-16856\n\n- New functions have been added to the `maps` module: `merge_with/3`,\n  `intersect/2`, `intersect_with/3`, `filtermap/2`, `from_keys/2`, and\n  `maps:foreach/2`.\n\n  `maps:merge_with/3` is the same as `merge/2` but takes an extra fun that is\n  used to combine items with the same key.\n\n  `maps:intersect/2` computes the intersection of two maps.\n\n  `maps:intersect_with/3` is the same as `intersect/2` but takes an extra fun\n  that is used to combine intersecting items.\n\n  `maps:filtermap/2` allows filtering and mapping of a map in a single pass.\n\n  `maps:from_keys/2` constructs a map from a list of keys and a single value and\n  can be used to optimize sets operations such as from_list/1, filter/2,\n  intersection/2, and subtract/2.\n\n  `maps:foreach/2` allows iteration over a map without returning any value.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-16936 Aux Id: ERL-1367\n\n- Change `escript`s to output any errors or warnings to standard error instead\n  of standard out.\n\n  \\*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \\***\n\n  Own Id: OTP-16945\n\n- A new erl parameter for specifying a file descriptor with configuration data\n  has been added.

This is accomplished by always printing the\n  number using scientific notation if it is so large that the integer part could\n  be rounded.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-16980 Aux Id: ERL-1308\n\n- The `erlang:monitor_node/2` BIF will now fail with a `notalive` exception if\n  distribution has not been started on the current node; it used to fail with a\n  `badarg` exception.\n\n  \\*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \\***\n\n  Own Id: OTP-16987\n\n- Accept references up to a size of 160-bits from remote nodes.

The main benefit of this is that reference counted\n  binaries can be referred to directly instead of copied into a new binary.\n\n  The default Erlang distribution over TCP will always utilize this. Alternate\n  distribution implementations utilizing a port as distribution controller will\n  utilize this if the driver implements the [`outputv`](driver_entry.md#outputv)\n  callback. Alternate Erlang distribution implementations utilizing a process as\n  distribution controller will utilize this if I/O vectors are utilized by the\n  functionality that processes the data returned from\n  [`erlang:dist_ctrl_get_data()`](`erlang:dist_ctrl_get_data/1`).\n\n  The return type for data returned by\n  [`erlang:dist_ctrl_get_data()`](`erlang:dist_ctrl_get_data/1`) has been\n  changed from `t:iodata/0` to `iovec()`. Note that `iovec()` data is valid\n  `t:iodata/0` so old implementations using `erlang:dist_ctrl_get_data()` do not\n  need to be changed, but may benefit from being changed depending on usage\n  scenario.\n\n  The new BIFs [`term_to_iovec/1`](`erlang:term_to_iovec/1`) and\n  [`term_to_iovec/2`](`erlang:term_to_iovec/2`) have been introduced.

To achieve this a couple of new options to the inet distribution has\n  been added.\n\n  - **\\-dist_listen false** - Setup the distribution channel, but do not listen\n    for incoming connection. This is useful when you want to use the current\n    node to interact with another node on the same machine without it joining\n    the entire cluster.\n\n  - **\\-erl_epmd_port Port** - Configure a default port that the built-in EPMD\n    client should return. This allows the local node to know the port to connect\n    to for any other node in the cluster.\n\n  The `erl_epmd` callback API has also been extended to allow returning `-1` as\n  the creation which means that a random creation will be created by the node.\n\n  In addition a new callback function called `listen_port_please` has been added\n  that allows the callback to return which listen port the distribution should\n  use. This can be used instead of `inet_dist_listen_min/max` if the listen port\n  is to be fetched from an external service.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-16250\n\n- On systems without `closefrom()`, such as Linux, iterating over all possible\n  file descriptors and calling `close()` for each is inefficient.

This is problematic\n  for all applications expecting a fully connected network to be provided, such\n  as for example `mnesia`, but also for `global` itself. A network of\n  overlapping partitions might cause the internal state of `global` to become\n  inconsistent. Such an inconsistency can remain even after such partitions have\n  been brought together to form a fully connected network again. The effect on\n  other applications that expects that a fully connected network is maintained\n  may vary, but they might misbehave in very subtle hard to detect ways during\n  such a partitioning.\n\n  In order to prevent such issues, we have introduced a _prevent overlapping\n  partitions_ fix which can be enabled using the\n  `prevent_overlapping_partitions` `kernel(6)` parameter. When this fix has been\n  enabled, `global` will actively disconnect from nodes that reports that they\n  have lost connections to other nodes. This will cause fully connected\n  partitions to form instead of leaving the network in a state with overlapping\n  partitions. Note that this fix _has_ to be enabled on _all_ nodes in the\n  network in order to work properly. Since this quite substantially changes the\n  behavior, this fix is currently disabled by default.

These counters\n  can cause scalability problems (especially on big NUMA systems). This change\n  adds an implementation of a decentralized counter and modifies the\n  implementation of ETS so that ETS tables of type `ordered_set` with\n  `write_concurrency` enabled use the decentralized counter.

Thus it is no longer possible to start the\n  statistics with\n  `rpc:call(Node, erlang, system_flag, [scheduler_wall_time, true])` since it\n  will be turned off directly afterwards when the rpc process dies.\n\n  \\*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \\***\n\n  Own Id: OTP-11694\n\n- A new logging API is added to Erlang/OTP, see the `m:logger` manual page, and\n  section [Logging](`e:kernel:logger_chapter.md`) in the Kernel User's Guide.\n\n  Calls to `error_logger` are automatically redirected to the new API, and\n  legacy error logger event handlers can still be used. It is, however,\n  recommended to use the Logger API directly when writing new code.\n\n  Notice the following potential incompatibilities:\n\n  - Kernel configuration parameters `error_logger` still works, but is overruled\n    if the default handler's output destination is configured with Kernel\n    configuration parameter `logger`.\n\n    In general, parameters for configuring error logger are overwritten by new\n    parameters for configuring Logger.\n\n  - The concept of SASL error logging is deprecated, meaning that by default the\n    SASL application does not affect which log events are logged.\n\n    By default, supervisor reports and crash reports are logged by the default\n    Logger handler started by Kernel, and end up at the same destination\n    (terminal or file) as other standard log event from Erlang/OTP.\n\n    Progress reports are not logged by default, but can be enabled by setting\n    the primary log level to info, for example with the Kernel configuration\n    parameter `logger_level`.\n\n    To obtain backwards compatibility with the SASL error logging functionality\n    from earlier releases, set Kernel configuration parameter\n    `logger_sasl_compatible` to `true`. This prevents the default Logger handler\n    from logging any supervisor-, crash-, or progress reports. Instead, SASL\n    adds a separate Logger handler during application start, which takes care of\n    these log events. The SASL configuration parameters `sasl_error_logger` and\n    `sasl_errlog_type` specify the destination (terminal or file) and severity\n    level to log for these events.\n\n  Since Logger is new in Erlang/OTP 21.0, we do reserve the right to introduce\n  changes to the Logger API and functionality in patches following this release.\n  These changes might or might not be backwards compatible with the initial\n  version.\n\n  \\*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \\***\n\n  Own Id: OTP-13295\n\n- `gen_sctp:connect_init/4` or rather connect in `inet_drv.c` for SCTP has been\n  fixed to not check the write file descriptor for writeability after a connect,\n  since for SCTP (SOCK_SEQPACKET) that property does not seem to be any kind of\n  indicator for when a connect has finished. This fixes connects that the OS\n  returned as \"in progress\" that was misinterpreted by `gen_sctp:connect_init`\n  as failed.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-13760 Aux Id: PR-1592\n\n- The file driver has been rewritten as a NIF, decreasing the latency of file\n  operations. Notable incompatibilities are:\n\n  - The `use_threads` option for `file:sendfile/5` no longer has any effect; we\n    either use non-blocking `sendfile(2)` or fall back to `file:read` \\+\n    `gen_tcp:send`.\n  - The file-specific DTrace probes have been removed. The same effect can be\n    achieved with normal tracing together with the `nif__entry`/`nif__return`\n    probes to track scheduling.\n\n  \\*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \\***\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14256\n\n- The I/O polling functionality of erts has been re-written to better make use\n  of the OSs polling mechanisms. This change means that erts will now always\n  prefer to use a kernel-polling mechanism if possible. Also all of the I/O\n  polling has been moved to dedicated threads instead of being placed in the\n  scheduler loops.\n\n  As a result of this, the `erl` options `+K` and `+secio` have been removed. It\n  is still possible to disable kernel-poll, but it has to be done at compile\n  time through the configure option `--disable-kernel-poll`.\n\n  The new `erl` options [`+IOt`](erl_cmd.md#%2BIOt) and\n  [`+IOp`](erl_cmd.md#%2BIOp) can be used to change how many IO poll threads and\n  poll sets that erts should use. See their respective documentation for more\n  details.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14346\n\n- Truly asynchronous auto-connect. Earlier, when `erlang:send` was aimed toward\n  an unconnected node, the function would not return until the connection setup\n  had completed (or failed). Now the function returns directly after the message\n  has been enqueued and the connection setup started.\n\n  The same applies to all distributed operations that may trigger auto-connect,\n  i.e. `'!'`, `send`, `link`, `monitor`, `monitor_node`, [`exit/2`](`exit/2`)\n  and `group_leader`.\n\n  The interface for all these functions are unchanged as they do not return\n  connection failures. The only exception is `erlang:monitor` where a _possible\n  incompatibility_ is introduced: An attempt to monitor a process on a primitive\n  node (such as erl_interface or jinterface), where remote process monitoring is\n  not implemented, will no longer fail with `badarg` exception. Instead a\n  monitor will be created, but it will only supervise the connection to the\n  node.\n\n  \\*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \\***\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14370\n\n- Changed the default behaviour of `.erlang` loading: `.erlang` is no longer\n  loaded from the current directory. `c:erlangrc(PathList)` can be used to\n  search and load an `.erlang` file from user specified directories.\n\n  `escript`, `erlc`, `dialyzer` and `typer` no longer load an `.erlang` at all.\n\n  \\*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \\***\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14439\n\n- New functionality for implementation of alternative carriers for the Erlang\n  distribution has been introduced. This mainly consists of support for usage of\n  distribution controller processes (previously only ports could be used as\n  distribution controllers). For more information see\n  [ERTS User's Guide ➜ How to implement an Alternative Carrier for the Erlang Distribution ➜ Distribution Module](alt_dist.md#distribution-module).\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14459\n\n- Add support for the lcc compiler and in extension the Elbrus 2000 platform.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14492\n\n- Support for \"tuple calls\" have been removed from the run-time system. Tuple\n  calls was an undocumented and unsupported feature which allowed the module\n  argument for an apply operation to be a tuple: `Var = dict:new(), Var:size()`.\n  This \"feature\" frequently caused confusion, especially when such call failed.\n  The stacktrace would point out functions that don't exist in the source code.\n\n  For legacy code that need to use parameterized modules or tuple calls for some\n  other reason, there is a new compiler option called `tuple_calls`. When this\n  option is given, the compiler will generate extra code that emulates the old\n  behavior for calls where the module is a variable.\n\n  \\*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \\***\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14497\n\n- Creation of small maps with literal keys has been optimized to be faster and\n  potentially use less memory. The keys are combined into a literal key tuple\n  which is put into the literal pool. The key tuple can be shared between many\n  instances of maps having the same keys.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14502\n\n- When an exception is thrown, include the arguments of the call in the\n  stacktrace for BIFs `band`, `bor`, `bsl`, `bsr`, `bxor`, `div`, `rem` and the\n  operators `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`.\n\n  \\*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \\***\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14508\n\n- The non-smp emulators have been removed. This means that the configure options\n  `--disable-threads` and `--enable-plain-emulator` have been removed and\n  configure will now refuse to build Erlang/OTP on platforms without thread\n  support.\n\n  In order to achieve a similar setup as the non-smp emulator, it is possible to\n  start Erlang/OTP with the `+S 1` option.\n\n  \\*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \\***\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14518\n\n- Modules that use floating point constants compiled with R15 or earlier will\n  need to be re-compiled before they can be loaded.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14575\n\n- Implementation of true asynchronous signaling between processes in order to\n  improve scalability.

That will save time and produce less\n  garbage. There are also some minor optimizations of '`try`/`catch`' both in\n  the compiler and run-time system.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14683\n\n- The guarantees and non-guarantees of `erlang:get_stacktrace/0` are now\n  documented.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14687\n\n- There is a new syntax in '`try/catch`' for retrieving the stacktrace without\n  calling '`erlang:get_stacktrace/0`'. See the reference manual for a\n  description of the new syntax. The '`erlang:get_stacktrace/0`' BIF is now\n  deprecated.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14692\n\n- New 'used' option for [`binary_to_term/2`](`binary_to_term/2`) that will also\n  return number of bytes actually read from the binary. This enables easy access\n  to any extra data in the binary located directly after the returned term.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14780\n\n- Added more statistics for `erlang:system_info({allocator,A})` in the\n  `mbcs_pool` section.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14795 Aux Id: ERL-88\n\n- Added `enif_ioq_peek_head` to retrieve Erlang terms from NIF IO queues without\n  having to resort to copying.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14797\n\n- There is a new option '`makedep_side_effect`' for the compiler and `-MMD` for\n  '`erlc`' that generates dependencies and continues to compile as normal.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14830\n\n- Added `ets:whereis/1` for retrieving the table identifier of a named table.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14884\n\n- `seq_trace` labels may now be any erlang term.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14899\n\n- Optimized the common case of `monitor` followed by `send` to the same local\n  process. The monitor signal is now delayed in order to be piggybacked with the\n  sent message and thereby only get one lock operation on the message queue of\n  the receiver. A delayed monitor signal is flushed if no `send` has been done\n  at the latest when the process is scheduled out.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14901\n\n- Make hipe compiled code work on x86_64 (amd64) with OS security feature PIE,\n  where executable code can be loaded into a random location. Old behavior, if\n  hipe was enabled, was to disable PIE build options for the VM.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14903\n\n- The number of driver async threads will now default to 1 as the standard\n  drivers do not use them anymore. Users that changed this value to tweak the\n  file driver should replace `+A` with `+SDio` since it now uses dirty IO\n  schedulers instead of async threads.\n\n  \\*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \\***\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14928\n\n- Optimize `==` and `/=` for binaries with different sizes to be constant in\n  time instead of proportional to the size of their common prefix.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14934 Aux Id: PR-1708\n\n- Refactorings making some internal process flags available for other usage.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14948\n\n- Removed need for HiPE to allocate native executable memory in low 2GB address\n  space on x86_64. Command line option `+MXscs` is thereby obsolete and ignored.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14951\n\n- Added `enif_make_map_from_arrays` for creating a populated map, analogous to\n  `enif_make_list_from_array`.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14954\n\n- Added configuration switches for busy-wait and wake up thresholds for dirty\n  schedulers, and changing these settings for normal schedulers will no longer\n  affect dirty schedulers.\n\n  Refer to the documentation for details. The new switches are\n  [\\+sbwtdcpu](erl_cmd.md#%2Bsbwtdcpu), [\\+sbwtdio](erl_cmd.md#%2Bsbwtdio),\n  [\\+swtdcpu](erl_cmd.md#%2Bswtdcpu), and [\\+swtdio](erl_cmd.md#%2Bswtdio).\n\n  The default busy wait threshold for dirty scheduler threads has also been\n  lowered to `short`.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14959\n\n- The list of \"taints\" now also includes dynamic loaded drivers in addition to\n  NIF libraries. Statically linked drivers and NIF libraries that are part of\n  erts are not included. The \"taints\" are returned by `system_info(taints)` and\n  printed in the header of `erl_crash.dump` files.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14960\n\n- Added `instrument:allocations` and `instrument:carriers` for retrieving\n  information about memory utilization and fragmentation.\n\n  The old `instrument` interface has been removed, as have the related options\n  `+Mim` and `+Mis`.\n\n  \\*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \\***\n\n  Own Id: OTP-14961\n\n- The process suspend functionality used by the `erlang:suspend_process/2` BIF\n  has been reimplemented using the newly introduced true asynchronous signaling\n  between processes.

The main usage area is to pin point performance\n  bottlenecks by checking which states the threads are in and then from there\n  figuring out why and where to optimize.\n\n  Since checking whether microstate accounting is on or off is relatively\n  expensive only a few of the states are enabled by default and more states can\n  be enabled through configure.\n\n  There is a convenience module called msacc that has been added to\n  runtime_tools that can assist in gathering and interpreting the data from\n  Microstate accounting.\n\n  For more information see\n  [erlang:statistics(microstate*accounting, *)](`m:erlang#statistics_microstate_accounting`)\n  and the `m:msacc` module in runtime_tools.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12345\n\n- The port of Erlang/OTP to the real-time operating system OSE has been removed.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12573\n\n- Sharing preserved copy for messages and exit signals\n\n  Enable sharing preserved copy with configure option\n  `--enable-sharing-preserving`. This will preserve sharing, within the process,\n  when communication with other processes in the Erlang node. There is a\n  trade-off, the copy is more costly but this cost can be reclaimed if there is\n  a lot of sharing in the message. In addition literals will not be copied in a\n  send except during a purge phase of the module where the literals are located.\n  This feature is considered experimental in 19.0.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12590 Aux Id: OTP-10251\n\n- Halfword BEAM has been removed.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12883\n\n- Added `os:perf_counter/1`.\n\n  The perf_counter is a very very cheap and high resolution timer that can be\n  used to timestamp system events.

This is useful when you\n  want to do some asynchronous initialization, for example getting configuration\n  from a pipe, and you want the initial open_port call to fail if the\n  configuration is incomplete or wrong.

This allows for a much more\n  robust implementation that uses less memory and does not block the entire\n  emulator if the program to be started is on an un-accessible NFS. Benchmarks\n  have shown this approach to be about 3-5 times as fast as the old approach\n  where the fork/vfork was done by erts. This is a pure stability and\n  performance fix, however some error messages may have changed, which is why it\n  is marked as a backwards incompatible change.\n\n  \\*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \\***\n\n  Own Id: OTP-13088\n\n- Improved yielding strategy in the implementation of the following native\n  functions:\n\n  - `erlang:binary_to_list/1`\n  - `erlang:binary_to_list/3`\n  - `erlang:bitstring_to_list/1`\n  - `erlang:list_to_binary/1`\n  - `erlang:iolist_to_binary/1`\n  - `erlang:list_to_bitstring/1`\n  - `binary:list_to_bin/1`\n\n  This in order to improve performance of these functions.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-13096\n\n- All garbage collections of processes now bump reductions.

Each process can be configured individually.\n\n  It is now possible to configure the message queue of a process, so that all\n  data referred by it will be kept outside of the heap, and by this prevent this\n  data from being part of garbage collections.\n\n  For more information see the documentation of\n  [`process_flag(message_queue_data, MQD)`](`m:erlang#process_flag_message_queue_data`).\n\n  Own Id: OTP-13366 Aux Id: OTP-13047\n\n- Processes now yield when scanning large message queues and not finding a\n  matching message.

This is a preparation of the distribution protocol to allow OTP 19\n  nodes to correctly communicate with future nodes (20 or higher). The\n  'creation' value differentiates different incarnations of the same node\n  (name).\n\n  Own Id: OTP-13488\n\n- Don't send unasked for systemd notifications in epmd\n\n  Own Id: OTP-13493 Aux Id: PR-999\n\n- The enif_send API has been extended to allow NULL to be used as the message\n  environment. When used this way, a message environment is implicitly created\n  and the given term is copied into that environment before sending. This can be\n  an optimization if many small messages are being sent by the nif.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-13495\n\n- The tracing support has been extended to allow tracing on ports. Ports can be\n  traced on using the 'ports', 'send' and 'receive' trace flags.\n\n  The first argument of `erlang:trace/3` has been extended so that `'all'`,\n  `'existing'` and `'new'` now include both processes and ports. New `Tracee`\n  variants, `'all_processes'`, `'all_ports'`, `'existing_processes'` etc have\n  been added to specify only processes or ports.\n\n  \\*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \\***\n\n  Own Id: OTP-13496\n\n- When the `'procs'` trace flag is enabled, a `'spawned'` trace event is now\n  also generated by a newly created process. The previous event `'spawn'`\n  remains, but as it is generated by the process that did the spawn, it is not\n  guaranteed that it is ordered with other trace events from the newly spawned\n  process. So when tracking the lifetime of a process this new event should be\n  used as the creation event.\n\n  This new trace event is marked as an incompatibility because tools that expect\n  certain trace events when enabling 'procs' will have to updated.\n\n  \\*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \\***\n\n  Own Id: OTP-13497\n\n- Add the `erlang:match_spec_test/3` function. The functions allows the testing\n  of match specifications for both tracing and ets tables. It can be used to\n  test that a match specification does the expected filtering on specific data.\n  It also returns more verbose error reasons for incorrectly constructed match\n  specifications.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-13501\n\n- The erts internal tracing support has been changed to have much less overhead\n  and be more scalable.\n\n  This rewrite does not break any backwards incompatibilities, but it does\n  change the ordering of some trace messages when compared to previous releases.\n  It should be noted that this only applies to trace messages sent to processes\n  or ports, it does not apply to the new tracer module. However in future\n  releases they may also be effected by this.\n\n  Trace messages are only guaranteed to be ordered from one traced process or\n  port.

These are used\n  when no other implementation of atomic memory operations is available. For\n  example, when compiling for ARM when `libatomic_ops` is not available.\n\n  The largest improvement will be seen when compiling with a `gcc` with support\n  for the `__atomic_*` builtins (using a `gcc` of at least version 4.7), but\n  also when only the legacy `__sync_*` builtins are available (using a `gcc` of\n  at least version 4.1) an improvement can be seen.\n\n  For more information see the\n  \"[Atomic Memory Operations and the VM](`e:system:install.md#advanced-configuration-and-build-of-erlang-otp_configuring_atomic-memory-operations-and-the-vm`)\"\n  section of `$ERL_TOP/HOWTO/INSTALL.md`.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12383\n\n- Introduce `math:log2/1` function to math module.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12411\n\n- The documentation of the Abstract Format (in the ERTS User's Guide) has been\n  updated with types and specification.

The change will occur when a Map reaches 33\n  pairs in size but this limit might change in the future.\n\n  The most significant impact for the user by this change is speed, and to a\n  lesser degree memory consumption and introspection of Maps. Memory consumption\n  size is probalistic but lesser than `gb_trees` or `dict` for instance. Any\n  other impacts will be transparent for the user except for the following\n  changes.\n\n  Semantics of Maps have changed in two incompatible ways compared to the\n  experimental implementation in OTP 17:\n\n  - Hashing of maps is done different by `erlang:phash2/1,2`, `erlang:phash/1`\n    and `erlang:hash/2`.\n  - Comparing two maps with ==, /=, =<, <, >= and >, is done different if the\n    keys contain floating point numbers.\n\n  \\*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \\***\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12585\n\n- Scalability improvement for `erlang:make_ref/0`, and other functionality that\n  create references. Each scheduler now manage its own set of references. By\n  this no communication at all is needed when creating references.\n\n  Previous implementation generated a strictly monotonically increasing sequence\n  of references corresponding to creation time on the runtime system instance.\n  This is _not_ the case with current implementation. You can only expect\n  reference to be unique. The Erlang/OTP documentation has never mentioned\n  anything else but the uniqueness property, so this change _is_ fully\n  compatible. The only reason we've marked this as a potential incompatibility\n  is since an early draft for an Erlang specification mentions strict\n  monotonicity as a property.\n\n  If you need to create data with a strict monotonicity property use\n  [erlang:unique_integer(\\[monotonic])](`erlang:unique_integer/1`). Do _not_ use\n  the deprecated [erlang:now()](`erlang:now/0`).\n\n  \\*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \\***\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12610\n\n- Enable different abort signal from heart\n\n  By using environment variable HEART_KILL_SIGNAL, heart can now use a different\n  signal to kill the old running Erlang.\n\n  By default the signal is SIGKILL but SIGABRT may also be used by setting\n  environment variable: HEART_KILL_SIGNAL=SIGABRT\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12613 Aux Id: seq12826\n\n- Update autconf to latest version 2015-03-04\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12646\n\n- Optimization of timers internally in the VM. This include process timers\n  (`receive ... after`), port timers (`driver_set_timer()`) as well as BIF\n  timers (`erlang:send_after()`/`erlang:start_timer()`).\n\n  Each scheduler thread now has its own lock-free timer service instead of one\n  locked central service. This dramatically improves performance of timer\n  management on systems with a large amount of schedulers and timers.\n\n  The timer service internal data structure has also been optimized to be able\n  to handle more timers than before. That is, each timer service is by its self\n  able to handle more timers without dramatic performance loss than the old\n  centralized timer service.\n\n  The API of BIF timers has also been extended. Timeout values are for example\n  no longer limited to 32-bit integers. For more information see the\n  documentation of `erlang:start_timer/4`, `erlang:send_after/4`,\n  `erlang:cancel_timer/2`, and `erlang:read_timer/2`.\n\n  Characteristics impact: Calls to the synchronous versions of\n  `erlang:cancel_timer()`, and `erlang:read_timer()` may take substantially\n  longer time to complete than before. This occur when the timer that is\n  accessed is managed by a remote scheduler. You typically want to use the new\n  asynchronous option in order to avoid blocking the calling process.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12650 Aux Id: OTP-11997\n\n- Specialize instructions from common assembler patterns\n\n  Specialize common instructions of `rem`, `band`, `minus` and `plus` in the\n  beam loader. This will reduce the number of fetches and thus lessen the\n  instruction dispatch pressure during runtime and speed up those operations in\n  some common cases.\n\n  Specialize move patterns from x-registers to the stack with a new\n  `move_window` instruction. This change will reduce instruction dispatch\n  pressure.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12690\n\n- Fix cross compilation for Android.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12693\n\n- Fix incorrect use of autoconf macro AC_EGREP_CPP, which could cause faulty\n  configuration if run from a path containing the string 'yes'.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12706\n\n- Minimal Java version is now 1.6\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12715\n\n- Send format and args on process exit to error_logger\n\n  Previously, the emulator would generate a whole string with values and call\n  the error_logger passing `\"~s~n\"`. This changes it to a format string\n  containing `~p` with the respective values as arguments.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12735\n\n- Map error logger warnings to warning messages by default.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12755\n\n- Configure architecture ppc64le architecture as a ppc64\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12761\n\n- Add function `enif_raise_exception` to allow a NIF to raise an error exception\n  with any type of reason.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12770\n\n- Optimized node table statistics retrieval.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12777\n\n- Map beam error logger warnings to warning messages by default. Previously\n  these messages were mapped to the error channel by default.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12781\n\n- gen_tcp:shutdown/2 is now asynchronous\n\n  This solves the following problems with the old implementation:\n\n  It doesn't block when the TCP peer is idle or slow. This is the expected\n  behaviour when shutdown() is called: the caller needs to be able to continue\n  reading from the socket, not be prevented from doing so.\n\n  It doesn't truncate the output. The current version of gen_tcp:shutdown/2 will\n  truncate any outbound data in the driver queue after about 10 seconds if the\n  TCP peer is idle of slow. Worse yet, it doesn't even inform anyone that the\n  data has been truncated: 'ok' is returned to the caller; and a FIN rather than\n  an RST is sent to the TCP peer.\n\n  \\*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \\***\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12797\n\n- Introduced delayed node table GC. This in order to avoid oscillation of\n  entries in and out of the tables. The oscillation caused unnecessary lock\n  contention on the table locks. The delay length can be set by passing the\n  [`+zdntgc`](erl_cmd.md#%2Bzdntgc) command line argument.\n\n  Characteristics impact: The tables can grow to very large sizes with unused\n  entries if the node is get huge amounts of short lived connections from other\n  nodes. This problem can be alleviated by shortening the length of the delay\n  using the `+zdntgc` command line argument.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12802\n\n- Improved implementation of [`erlang:statistics`](`erlang:statistics/1`)`(io)`\n  in order to reduce contention between schedulers.\n\n  Characteristics impact: The actual call to `erlang:statistics(io)` takes\n  longer time to complete, but the overall impact on the system is improved.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12842\n\n- There are many cases where user code needs to be able to distinguish between a\n  socket that was closed normally and one that was aborted. Setting the option\n  \\{show_econnreset, true\\} enables the user to receive ECONNRESET errors on\n  both active and passive sockets.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-12843\n\n- Do not preallocate too large event pool\n\n  A default pool size of 4000 is too excessive for the common case.

When enabled, changed timing\n  in the system, normally a small overhead due to measuring of utilization and\n  calculating balancing information. On some systems, such as old Windows\n  systems, the overhead can be quite substantial. This time measurement overhead\n  highly depend on the underlying primitives provided by the OS.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-11385\n\n- A call to either the [`garbage_collect/1`](`garbage_collect/1`) BIF or the\n  [`check_process_code/2`](`check_process_code/2`) BIF may trigger garbage\n  collection of another processes than the process calling the BIF. The previous\n  implementations performed these kinds of garbage collections without\n  considering the internal state of the process being garbage collected. In\n  order to be able to more easily and more efficiently implement yielding native\n  code, these types of garbage collections have been rewritten. A garbage\n  collection like this is now triggered by an asynchronous request signal, the\n  actual garbage collection is performed by the process being garbage collected\n  itself, and finalized by a reply signal to the process issuing the request.\n  Using this approach processes can disable garbage collection and yield without\n  having to set up the heap in a state that can be garbage collected.\n\n  The [`garbage_collect/2`](`erlang:garbage_collect/2`), and\n  [`check_process_code/3`](`erlang:check_process_code/3`) BIFs have been\n  introduced. Both taking an option list as last argument. Using these, one can\n  issue asynchronous requests.\n\n  `code:purge/1` and `code:soft_purge/1` have been rewritten to utilize\n  asynchronous `check_process_code` requests in order to parallelize work.\n\n  Characteristics impact: A call to the\n  [`garbage_collect/1`](`garbage_collect/1`) BIF or the\n  [`check_process_code/2`](`check_process_code/2`) BIF will normally take longer\n  time to complete while the system as a whole won't be as much negatively\n  effected by the operation as before. A call to `code:purge/1` and\n  `code:soft_purge/1` may complete faster or slower depending on the state of\n  the system while the system as a whole won't be as much negatively effected by\n  the operation as before.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-11388 Aux Id: OTP-11535, OTP-11648\n\n- Cleanup 'Buckets' and 'Time left' fields in crashdump to ease parsing.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-11419\n\n- Add sync option to file:open/2.\n\n  The sync option adds the POSIX O_SYNC flag to the open system call on\n  platforms that support the flag or its equivalent, e.g.,\n  FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH on Windows. For platforms that don't support it,\n  file:open/2 returns \\{error, enotsup\\} if the sync option is passed in.

(Thanks to Svante Karlsson for the\n  original patch)\n\n  Impact: Programs running binary_to_term on large binaries will run more\n  smoothly, but rescheduling will impact the single process performance of the\n  BIF.

This avoids too long\n  schedules when term_to_binary is used.\n\n  Impact: Programs running term_to_binary on large terms will run more smothly,\n  but rescheduling will impact the single process performance of the BIF. Single\n  threaded benchmarks will show degraded performance of the BIF when called with\n  very large terms, while general system behaviour will be improved. The\n  overhead for allowing restart and reduction counting also degrades local\n  performance of the BIF with between 5% and 10% even for small terms.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-11163","ref":"notes.html#fixed-bugs-and-malfunctions"},{"type":"extras","title":"Improvements and New Features - ERTS Release Notes","doc":"- Replaced the lock protecting gathering of garbage collection statistics with a\n  lock-free solution.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-10271 Aux Id: kunagi-108 \\[04c5410f-9cc4-4696-8639-36bf98686c7a-7]\n\n- Support for migration of memory carriers between memory allocator instances\n  has been introduced.\n\n  By default this feature is not enabled and do not effect the characteristics\n  of the system.

Previously used algorithm either caused insert or\n    delete to be O(N).\n  - The new algorithm will also ensure that reuse of identifiers will be less\n    frequent than when the old algorithm was used.\n  - Previously used algorithm ensured that the latest created identifier\n    compared as the largest when comparing two identifiers of the same type that\n    had been created on the same node as long as no identifiers had been reused.\n    Since identifiers can be reused quite fast, one has never been able to rely\n    on this property. Due to the introduction of this new algorithm this\n    property will not hold even if no identifiers has been reused yet. This\n    could be considered as an incompatibility.\n\n  Due to the above mensioned potential incompatibility, it will still be\n  possible to enable the old algorithm for some time.

This more or less\n    only translates into minor memory leaks.\n\n  - **Shutting down distribution** - The distribution shutdown phase used when\n    manually shutting down the distribution, i.e., when calling\n    `net_kernel:stop()`, could potentially hang.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-10854\n\n- OS X Snow Leopard now only uses write, as writev does not work properly on\n  very large files.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-10858\n\n- Fixed a bug where line oriented file I/O using read_ahead was very slow for\n  files with very large difference in line length.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-10859\n\n- In erts-5.10 (R16A) faulty hashvalues were produced for non-ASCII atoms\n  (characters in byte-range 128..255).

For example when, creating ports,\n    terminating ports, etc.\n  - Dynamic allocation of port structures. This allow for a much larger maximum\n    amount of ports allowed as a default. The previous default of 1024 has been\n    raised to 65536. Maximum amount of ports can be set using the\n    [\\+Q](erl_cmd.md#%2BQ) command line flag of [erl(1)](erl_cmd.md). The\n    previously used environment variable `ERL_MAX_PORTS` has been deprecated and\n    scheduled for removal in OTP-R17.\n  - Major rewrite of scheduling of port tasks. Major benefits of the rewrite are\n    reduced contention on run queue locks, and reduced amount of memory\n    allocation operations needed. The rewrite was also necessary in order to\n    make it possible to schedule signals from processes to ports.\n  - Improved internal thread progress functionality for easy management of\n    unmanaged threads. This improvement was necessary for the rewrite of the\n    port task scheduling.\n  - Rewrite of all process to port signal implementations in order to make it\n    possible to schedule those operations. All port operations can now be\n    scheduled which allows for reduced lock contention on the port lock as well\n    as truly asynchronous communication with ports.\n  - Optimized lookup of port handles from drivers.\n  - Optimized driver lookup when creating ports.\n  - Preemptible `erlang:ports/0` BIF.\n  - Improving responsiveness by bumping reductions for a process calling a\n    driver callback directly.\n\n  These changes imply changes of the characteristics of the system. The most\n  notable:\n\n  - **Order of signal delivery** - The previous implementation of the VM has\n    delivered signals from processes to ports in a synchronous stricter fashion\n    than required by the language. As of ERTS version 5.10, signals are truly\n    asynchronously delivered. The order of signal delivery still adheres to the\n    requirements of the language, but only to the requirements. That is, some\n    signal sequences that previously always were delivered in one specific order\n    may now from time to time be delivered in different orders. This may cause\n    Erlang programs that have made _false assumptions_ about signal delivery\n    order to fail even though they previously succeeded. For more information\n    about signal ordering guarantees, see the chapter on\n    [communication](communication.md) in the ERTS user's guide. The `+n` command\n    line flag of [erl(1)](erl_cmd.md) can be helpful when trying to find\n    signaling order bugs in Erlang code that have been exposed by these changes.\n\n  - **Latency of signals sent from processes to ports** - Signals from processes\n    to ports where previously always delivered immediately. This kept latency\n    for such communication to a minimum, but it could cause lock contention\n    which was very expensive for the system as a whole. In order to keep this\n    latency low also in the future, most signals from processes to ports are by\n    default still delivered immediately as long as no conflicts occur. Such\n    conflicts include not being able to acquire the port lock, but also include\n    other conflicts. When a conflict occur, the signal will be scheduled for\n    delivery at a later time. A scheduled signal delivery may cause a higher\n    latency for this specific communication, but improves the overall\n    performance of the system since it reduce lock contention between\n    schedulers. The default behavior of only scheduling delivery of these\n    signals on conflict can be changed by passing the [\\+spp](erl_cmd.md#%2Bspp)\n    command line flag to [erl(1)](erl_cmd.md). The behavior can also be changed\n    on port basis using the [parallelism](`m:erlang#open_port_parallelism`)\n    option of the [open_port/2](`erlang:open_port/2`) BIF.\n\n  - **Execution time of the `erlang:ports/0` BIF** - Since `erlang:ports/0` now\n    can be preempted, the responsiveness of the system as a whole has been\n    improved. A call to `erlang:ports/0` may, however, take a much longer time\n    to complete than before. How much longer time heavily depends on the system\n    load.\n\n  - **Reduction cost of calling driver callbacks** - Calling a driver callback\n    is quite costly. This was previously not reflected in reduction cost at all.\n    Since the reduction cost now has increased, a process performing lots of\n    direct driver calls will be scheduled out more frequently than before.\n\n  _Potential incompatibilities_:\n\n  - `driver_send_term()` has been deprecated and has been scheduled for removal\n    in OTP-R17. Replace usage of `driver_send_term()` with usage of\n    [erl_drv_send_term()](erl_driver.md#erl_drv_send_term).\n  - `driver_output_term()` has been deprecated and has been scheduled for\n    removal in OTP-R17. Replace usage of `driver_output_term()` with usage of\n    [erl_drv_output_term()](erl_driver.md#erl_drv_output_term).\n  - The new function\n    [erl_drv_busy_msgq_limits()](erl_driver.md#erl_drv_busy_msgq_limits) has\n    been added in order to able to control management of port queues.\n\n  The [driver API version](erl_driver.md#version_management) has been bumped to\n  2.1 from 2.0 due to the above changes in the driver API.\n\n  \\*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \\***\n\n  Own Id: OTP-10336 Aux Id: OTP-9892\n\n- The experimental support for packages has been removed.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-10348 Aux Id: kunagi-316 \\[227]\n\n- Wrong parameters when setting seq_trace-tokens from within a trace-pattern\n  could crash the VM.

This strategy is not as quick to forget about previous overload as\n  the previous strategy.\n\n  This change imply changes of the characteristics the system. Most notable:\n  When a small overload comes and then disappears repeatedly, the system will\n  for a bit longer time be willing to wake up schedulers than before. Timing in\n  the system will due to this also change.\n\n  The previous strategy can still be enabled by passing the\n  [\\+sws legacy](erl_cmd.md#%2Bsws) command line flag to `erl`.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-10661 Aux Id: OTP-10033\n\n- The [\\+stbt](erl_cmd.md#%2Bstbt) command line argument of `erl` was added.\n  This argument can be used for trying to set scheduler bind type.

Thanks to Tuncer Ayaz and Sebastian Rasmussen.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-10733\n\n- The runtime system will now by default use 10 async threads if thread support\n  has been enabled when building the runtime system.\n\n  This will prevent long blocking file-operations from blocking scheduler\n  threads for long periods of time, which can be harmful. Apart from\n  file-operations, it also effects other operations scheduled on the async\n  thread pool by user implemented drivers.\n\n  The amount of async threads can be controlled by using the\n  [`+A`](erl_cmd.md#async_thread_pool_size) command line argument of\n  [erl](erl_cmd.md). When running some offline tools you _might_ want to disable\n  async threads, but you are advised _not_ to in the general case. Instead, you\n  might want to increase the amount of async threads used.\n\n  This change imply changes of the characteristics the system compared to the\n  previous default. The responsiveness of the system as a whole will be\n  improved. Operations scheduled on the async thread pool will get an increased\n  latency. The throughput of these operations may increase, or decrease\n  depending on the type of the operations and how they get scheduled. In the\n  case of file operations, the throughput very much depends on how the Erlang\n  application access files. Multiple concurrent accesses to different files have\n  the potential of an increased throughput.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-10736\n\n- The default reader group limit has been increased to 64 from 8. This limit can\n  be set using the `+rg` command line argument of [erl](erl_cmd.md).\n\n  This change of default value will reduce lock contention on ETS tables using\n  the `read_concurrency` option at the expense of memory consumption when the\n  amount of schedulers and logical processors are between 8 and 64. For more\n  information, see documentation of the `+rg` command line argument of\n  [erl](erl_cmd.md).\n\n  Own Id: OTP-10737\n\n- New BIF float_to_list/2 which solves a problem of float_to_list/1 that doesn't\n  allow specifying the number of digits after the decimal point when formatting\n  floats (Thanks to Serge Aleynikov).\n\n  Own Id: OTP-10752\n\n- Limited support for unicode atoms in the external format and in the internal\n  representation of the vm.

The\n  number of internal table locks has increased from 16 to 64. This makes it four\n  times less likely that two concurrent processes writing to the same table\n  would collide and thereby serialized. The cost is an increased constant memory\n  footprint for tables using write_concurrency. The memory consumption per\n  inserted record is not affected. The increased footprint can be particularly\n  large if `write_concurrency` is combined with `read_concurrency`.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-10787","ref":"notes.html#improvements-and-new-features"},{"type":"extras","title":"Erts 5.9.3.1 - ERTS Release Notes","doc":"","ref":"notes.html#erts-5-9-3-1"},{"type":"extras","title":"Known Bugs and Problems - ERTS Release Notes","doc":"- Create an erl_crash.dump if no heart exists and no ERL_CRASH_DUMP_SECONDS is\n  set (behaviour changed).\n\n  Don't create an erl_crash.dump if heart do exists and no\n  ERL_CRASH_DUMP_SECONDS is set (behaviour not changed).\n\n  This changes the behaviour back to the R15B02 default considering if a beam\n  was running with no heart.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-10602","ref":"notes.html#known-bugs-and-problems"},{"type":"extras","title":"Erts 5.9.3 - ERTS Release Notes","doc":"","ref":"notes.html#erts-5-9-3"},{"type":"extras","title":"Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions - ERTS Release Notes","doc":"- Fix linking in OpenBSD.

This bug has been corrected by changing the\n  behaviour of erlang:halt/0,1, which should fix the same problem for other\n  escript-like applications, i.e that data stored in the output port driver\n  buffers got lost when printing on a TTY and exiting through erlang:halt/0,1.\n\n  The BIF:s erlang:halt/0,1 has gotten improved semantics and there is a new BIF\n  erlang:halt/2 to accomplish something like the old semantics. See the\n  documentation.\n\n  Now erlang:halt/0 and erlang:halt/1 with an integer argument will close all\n  ports and allow all pending async threads operations to finish before exiting\n  the emulator. Previously erlang:halt/0 and erlang:halt(0) would just wait for\n  pending async threads operations but not close ports. And erlang:halt/1 with a\n  non-zero integer argument would not even wait for pending async threads\n  operations.\n\n  To roughly the old behaviour, to not wait for ports and async threads\n  operations when you exit the emulator, you use erlang:halt/2 with an integer\n  first argument and an option list containing \\{flush,false\\} as the second\n  argument. Note that now is flushing not dependent of the exit code, and you\n  cannot only flush async threads operations which we deemed as a strange\n  behaviour anyway.\n\n  Also, erlang:halt/1,2 has gotten a new feature: If the first argument is the\n  atom 'abort' the emulator is aborted producing a core dump, if the operating\n  system so allows.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-9985\n\n- Added check to inet driver to avoid building on operating systems that do not\n  yet have IPv6 compatible socket API.

However, if other operating system processes (as for example another\n  Erlang runtime system) also bind threads to logical processors, there might be\n  a performance penalty instead. In some cases this performance penalty might be\n  severe. Due to this, we change the default so that the user must make an\n  active decision in order to bind schedulers.\n\n  \\*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \\***\n\n  Own Id: OTP-9726\n\n- The use of `erlang:system_flag(scheduler_bind_type, _)` and\n  `erlang:system_flag(cpu_topology, _)` have been deprecated and scheduled for\n  removal in erts-5.10/OTP-R16.

The `ethread`\n  library is an Erlang runtime system internal, portable thread library used by\n  the runtime system itself.\n\n  Most notable improvement is a reader optimized rwlock implementation which\n  dramatically improve the performance of read-lock/read-unlock operations on\n  multi processor systems by avoiding ping-ponging of the rwlock cache lines.\n  The reader optimized rwlock implementation is used by miscellaneous rwlocks in\n  the runtime system that are known to be read-locked frequently, and can be\n  enabled on ETS tables by passing the\n  [\\{read_concurrency, true\\}](`m:ets#new_2_read_concurrency`) option upon table\n  creation. See the documentation of `ets:new/2` for more information. The\n  reader optimized rwlock implementation can be fine tuned when starting the\n  runtime system. For more information, see the documentation of the\n  [\\+rg](erl_cmd.md#%2Brg) command line argument of `erl`.\n\n  There is also a new implementation of rwlocks that is not optimized for\n  readers. Both implementations interleaves readers and writers during\n  contention as opposed to, e.g., the NPTL (Linux) pthread rwlock implementation\n  which use either a reader or writer preferred strategy. The reader/writer\n  preferred strategy is problematic since it starves threads doing the\n  non-preferred operation.\n\n  The new rwlock implementations in general performs better in ERTS than common\n  pthread implementations. However, in some extremely heavily contended cases\n  this is not the case. Such heavy contention can more or less only appear on\n  ETS tables. This when multiple processes do very large amounts of write locked\n  operations simultaneously on the same table. Such use of ETS is bad regardless\n  of rwlock implementation, will never scale, and is something we strongly\n  advise against.\n\n  The new rwlock implementations depend on atomic operations. If no native\n  atomic implementation is found, a fallback solution will be used. Using the\n  fallback implies a performance degradation. That is, it is more important now\n  than before to build OTP with a native atomic implementation.\n\n  The `ethread` library contains native atomic implementations for, x86 (32 and\n  64 bit), powerpc (32 bit), sparc V9 (32 and 64 bit), and tilera (32 bit). On\n  other hardware gcc's builtin support for atomic memory access will be used if\n  such exists. If no such support is found, `configure` will warn about no\n  atomic implementation available.\n\n  The `ethread` library can now also use the `libatomic_ops` library for atomic\n  memory accesses. This makes it possible for the Erlang runtime system to\n  utilize optimized native atomic operations on more platforms than before. If\n  `configure` warns about no atomic implementation available, try using the\n  `libatomic_ops` library. Use the\n  [\\--with-libatomic_ops=PATH](`e:system:install.md#advanced-configuration-and-build-of-erlang-otp`)\n  `configure` command line argument when specifying where the `libatomic_ops`\n  installation is located. The `libatomic_ops` library can be downloaded from:\n  [http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/](http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/)\n\n  The changed API of the `ethread` library has also caused modifications in the\n  Erlang runtime system. Preparations for the to come \"delayed deallocation\"\n  feature has also been done since it depends on the `ethread` library.\n\n  _Note_: When building for x86, the `ethread` library will now use instructions\n  that first appeared on the pentium 4 processor. If you want the runtime system\n  to be compatible with older processors (back to 486) you need to pass the\n  [\\--enable-ethread-pre-pentium4-compatibility](`e:system:install.md#advanced-configuration-and-build-of-erlang-otp`)\n  `configure` command line argument when configuring the system.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-8544\n\n- erlang:localtime_to_universaltime(\\{\\{2008, 8, 1\\}, \\{0, 0, 0\\}\\},true) when\n  TZ=UTC now behaves consistently on all Unix platforms.\n\n  The problem fixed was originally reported by Paul Guyot on erlang-bugs mailing\n  list:\n\n  http://www.erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-bugs/2008-November/001077.html\n\n  Own Id: OTP-8580\n\n- Optimization reducing memory consumption by two words per ETS object.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-8737\n\n- Fixes for unsupported halfword-emulator\n\n  Own Id: OTP-8745\n\n- NIF 64-bit integer support; `enif_get_int64`, `enif_get_uint64`,\n  `enif_make_int64`, `enif_make_uint64`.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-8746\n\n- Alignment of trailing data in messages has been adjusted.

The new atom cache protocol also use an\n  atom cache size 8 times larger than before. The new atom cache protocol is\n  documented in the ERTS users guide.\n\n  Erlang messages received via the distribution are now decoded by the receiving\n  Erlang processes without holding any distribution channel specific locks.\n  Erlang messages and signals sent over the distribution are as before encoded\n  by the sending Erlang process, but now without holding any distribution\n  channel specific locks during the encoding. That is, both encoding and\n  decoding can be and are done in parallel regardless of distribution channel\n  used.\n\n  The part that cannot be parallelized is the atom cache updates. Atom cache\n  updates are therefore now scheduled on the distribution port. Since it is only\n  one entity per distribution channel doing this work there is no lock\n  contention due to the atom cache updates.\n\n  The new runtime system does not understand the old atom cache protocol. New\n  and old runtime systems can however still communicate, but no atom cache will\n  be used.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-7774\n\n- Fixed a bug that caused error logging from `driver_select` sometimes with\n  additional symptoms such as failing IP communications or even an emulator\n  crash.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-7898 Aux Id: seq11304\n\n- Improved SMP concurrency for ETS tables. Several mutating operations can now\n  be performed truly concurrent on different records of the same table. To\n  support this, the table has to be created with option `write_concurrency`, as\n  it is achieved at the expense of some execution and memory overhead.\n  `ets:select` and `select_count` has also been improved for all tables to not\n  acquire exclusive table lock during the iteration.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-7922\n\n- erl (that is erl.exe and dyn_erl) and erlexec has been made more dynamic so no\n  hard coded paths needs to added at installation time to erl (that is erl.ini\n  and erl). Reltool will make use of this in a future release.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-7952\n\n- Added functionality to get higher resolution timestamp from system. The\n  erlang:now function returns a timestamp that's not always consistent with the\n  actual operating system time (due to resilience against large time changes in\n  the operating system). The function os:timestamp/0 is added to get a similar\n  timestamp as the one being returned by erlang:now, but untouched by Erlangs\n  time correcting and smoothing algorithms. The timestamp returned by\n  os:timestamp is always consistent with the operating systems view of time,\n  like the calendar functions for getting wall clock time, but with higher\n  resolution. Example of usage can be found in the os manual page.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-7971\n\n- Two new options are added to open_port - spawn_executable which runs external\n  executables in a controlled way, and spawn_driver which only opens port to\n  loaded Erlang drivers.

Now all\n  strings will be stored expanded to lists (such as `[$a,$b,$c]`) in the\n  constant pool. That means that the string will be faster to use at run-time,\n  but that it will require more space even when not used. If space is an issue,\n  you might want to use binary literals (that is, `<<\"abc\">>`) instead of string\n  literals for infrequently used long strings (such as error messages).\n\n  Own Id: OTP-6850\n\n- The Erlang driver API has been extended with a portable POSIX thread like API\n  for multi-threading.

When the emulator had other\n  things to do, such as running Erlang processes, the emulator polled for\n  termination in between scheduling of processes.\n\n  Now the emulator doesn't poll for termination of the port program at all;\n  instead, it waits for the child signal from the terminated port program to\n  arrive and then schedules the Erlang port for termination.\n\n  The termination of any port programs have also been optimized. Previously the\n  termination of any port program did always cause a scan of a table of the size\n  equal to maximum number of file descriptors. If the maximum number of file\n  descriptors was large, this scan could be quite expensive.

The released system is however\n  truly multi threaded and you will notice increased performance for many\n  applications already. We recommend that you evaluate your application on the\n  SMP version of the runtime system and wait for some more optimizations before\n  you use it in a real product. You will then discover if there are any problems\n  in your application that needs to be fixed in order for it to work properly in\n  a multi threaded environment. More optimized versions of the runtime system\n  with SMP support will be included in the R11B maintenance releases.\n\n  The SMP enabled runtime system will be started if the `-smp` command line\n  argument is passed to the `erl` command. In order to make use of more than one\n  processor core, multiple scheduler threads are used. By default, the number of\n  scheduler threads will equal the number of processor cores. The number of\n  scheduler threads can be set with the `+S` command line argument. For more\n  information see the [erl](erl_cmd.md) man page.\n\n  A runtime system with SMP support is by default built on the following\n  platforms if posix threads, and a gcc compiler of at least version 2.95 is\n  found:\n\n  - Linux with at least kernel version 2.6 and the Native POSIX Thread Library\n    on x86, x86_64, and 32-bits PowerPC.\n  - Solaris of at least version 8 on 32-bits SPARC-V9.\n  - MacOSX of at least version 10.4 (Darwin 8.0) on 32-bits PowerPC.\n\n  The runtime system with SMP support is known _not_ to build on:\n\n  - Windows.\n  - Linux with kernel versions less than 2.4, or without the Native POSIX Thread\n    Library.\n  - Other hardware platforms than x86, x86_64, 32-bits SPARC-V9 and 32-bits\n    PowerPC.\n\n  Windows will be supported in a future release.\n\n  The runtime system with SMP support might build on other operating systems in\n  combination with supported hardware. In order to force a build of a runtime\n  system with SMP support, pass the `--enable-smp-support` command line argument\n  to configure. Note, however, that it is not enough that it builds. The\n  underlying thread library and operating system has to provide SMP support as\n  well. If the thread library does not distribute scheduler threads over\n  multiple processor cores then the runtime system will only seemingly provide\n  SMP support. If the runtime system is not built by default on a specific\n  platform, we have _not_ tested it on that platform.\n\n  _NOTE_: The design of SMP support for drivers is ongoing. There will probably\n  be incompatible driver changes (only affecting drivers run on the runtime\n  system with SMP support) released as patches for R11B.\n\n  _Potential incompatibility_: Previously, specific driver call-backs were\n  always called from the same thread. This is _not_ true in the runtime system\n  with SMP support. Calls to call-backs will be made from different threads,\n  e.g., two consecutive calls to exactly the same call-back can be made from two\n  different threads. This will in _most_ cases not be a problem. All calls to\n  call-backs are synchronized, i.e., only one call-back will be called at a\n  time.\n\n  In the future the default behavior will _probably_ be the following: Calls to\n  call-backs will, as now, be made from different threads. Calls to call-backs\n  in the same driver _instance_ will be synchronized. It will probably be\n  possible to configure so that all calls to call-backs in all driver instances\n  of a specific driver type will be synchronized. It may be possible to\n  configure so that all calls to call-backs of a driver instance or a of a\n  specific driver type will be made from the same thread.\n\n  Parallelism in the Erlang code executed is a necessity for the Erlang runtime\n  system to be able to take advantage of multi-core or multi-processor hardware.\n  There need to be at least as many Erlang processes runnable as processor cores\n  for the Erlang runtime system to be able to take advantage of all processor\n  cores.\n\n  An Erlang runtime system with SMP support with only one Erlang process\n  runnable all the time will almost always be slower than the same Erlang\n  runtime system without SMP support. This is due to thread synchronization\n  overhead.\n\n  Known major bottleneck in the Erlang runtime system:\n\n  - Currently the I/O system uses one \"big lock\", i.e. only one thread can do\n    I/O at a time (with the exception of async threads and threads created by\n    users own linked-in drivers). This is high on the list of things to\n    optimize. Note, code that does not do I/O can be executed at the same time\n    as one thread does I/O.\n\n  Some pitfalls which might cause Erlang programs that work on the non-SMP\n  runtime system to fail on the SMP runtime system:\n\n  - A newly spawned process will often begin executing immediately. Code that\n    expects that the parent process will be able to execute for a while before\n    the child process begins executing is likely to fail.\n  - High priority processes could previously provide mutual exclusion (bad\n    programming style) by preventing normal and low priority processes from\n    being run. High priority processes cannot be used this way to provide mutual\n    exclusion.\n  - `erlang:yield()` could be used to provide some kind of temporary mutual\n    exclusion (also bad programming style). `erlang:yield()` cannot be used to\n    provide any kind of mutual exclusion.\n  - Obscure pitfall, only if a process being traced also sends normal messages\n    to the tracer:  \n      The order between trace messages and normal messages is undefined. I.e.\n    the order between normal messages sent from a tracee to a tracer and the\n    trace messages generated from the same tracee to the same tracer is\n    undefined. The internal order of normal messages and the internal order of\n    trace messages will, of course, be preserved as before.\n\n  The kernel poll feature is currently not supported by the runtime system with\n  SMP support. It will probably be supported in a future release.\n\n  \\*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \\***\n\n  Own Id: OTP-6006 Aux Id: OTP-6095\n\n- Linked-in driver modifications.\n\n  - Linked-in drivers must be recompiled.\n  - The `refc` field in the `ErlDrvBinary` type has been removed.

As Erlang is a language with soft real-time\nproperties and we can express time in our programs, the Virtual Machine and the\nlanguage must be careful about what is considered a correct time and in how time\nfunctions behave.\n\nWhen Erlang was designed, it was assumed that the wall clock time in the system\nshowed a monotonic time moving forward at exactly the same pace as the\ndefinition of time. This more or less meant that an atomic clock (or better time\nsource) was expected to be attached to your hardware and that the hardware was\nthen expected to be locked away from any human tinkering forever. While this can\nbe a compelling thought, it is simply never the case.\n\nA \"normal\" modern computer cannot keep time, not on itself and not unless you\nhave a chip-level atomic clock wired to it. Time, as perceived by your computer,\nmust normally be corrected. Hence the Network Time Protocol (NTP) protocol,\ntogether with the `ntpd` process, does its best to keep your computer time in\nsync with the correct time. Between NTP corrections, usually a less potent\ntime-keeper than an atomic clock is used.\n\nHowever, NTP is not fail-safe. The NTP server can be unavailable, `ntp.conf` can\nbe wrongly configured, or your computer can sometimes be disconnected from\nInternet. Furthermore, you can have a user (or even system administrator) who\nthinks the correct way to handle Daylight Saving Time is to adjust the clock one\nhour two times a year (which is the incorrect way to do it). To complicate\nthings further, this user fetched your software from Internet and has not\nconsidered what the correct time is as perceived by a computer. The user does\nnot care about keeping the wall clock in sync with the correct time. The user\nexpects your program to have unlimited knowledge about the time.\n\nMost programmers also expect time to be reliable, at least until they realize\nthat the wall clock time on their workstation is off by a minute. Then they set\nit to the correct time, but most probably not in a smooth way.\n\nThe number of problems that arise when you always expect the wall clock time on\nthe system to be correct can be immense. Erlang therefore introduced the\n\"corrected estimate of time\", or the \"time correction\", many years ago. The time\ncorrection relies on the fact that most operating systems have some kind of\nmonotonic clock, either a real-time extension or some built-in \"tick counter\"\nthat is independent of the wall clock settings. This counter can have\nmicrosecond resolution or much less, but it has a drift that cannot be ignored.","ref":"time_correction.html#introduction"},{"type":"extras","title":"Time Correction - Time and Time Correction in Erlang","doc":"If time correction is enabled, the Erlang runtime system makes use of both\n[OS system time](time_correction.md#os-system-time) and\n[OS monotonic time](time_correction.md#os-monotonic-time), to adjust the\nfrequency of the Erlang monotonic clock.

In many use\ncases there is a need to measure elapsed time or specify a time relative to\nanother point in time without the need to know the involved times in UTC or any\nother globally defined time scale. By introducing a time scale with a local\ndefinition of where it starts, time that do not concern calendar time can be\nmanaged on that time scale. Erlang monotonic time uses such a time scale with a\nlocally defined start.\n\nThe introduction of Erlang monotonic time allows us to adjust the two Erlang\ntimes (Erlang monotonic time and Erlang system time) separately. By doing this,\nthe accuracy of elapsed time does not have to suffer just because the system\ntime happened to be wrong at some point in time. Separate adjustments of the two\ntimes are only performed in the time warp modes, and only fully separated in the\n[multi-time warp mode](time_correction.md#multi-time-warp-mode). All other modes\nthan the multi-time warp mode are for backward compatibility reasons. When using\nthese modes, the accuracy of Erlang monotonic time suffer, as the adjustments of\nErlang monotonic time in these modes are more or less tied to Erlang system\ntime.\n\nThe adjustment of system time could have been made smother than using a time\nwarp approach, but we think that would be a bad choice.

Later calls replace the\n  appended message.\n\n  As a special case, `{message, false}` disables sending of trace messages\n  ('call' and 'return_to') for this function call, just like if the match\n  specification had not matched. This can be useful if only the side effects of\n  the `MatchBody` part are desired.\n\n  Another special case is `{message, true}`, which sets the default behavior, as\n  if the function had no match specification; trace message is sent with no\n  extra information (if no other calls to `message` are placed before\n  `{message, true}`, it is in fact a \"noop\").\n\n  Takes one argument: the message. Returns `true` and can only be used in the\n  `MatchBody` part and when tracing.\n\n- **`return_trace`** - Causes a `return_from` trace message to be sent upon\n  return from the current function. Takes no arguments, returns `true` and can\n  only be used in the `MatchBody` part when tracing. If the process trace flag\n  `silent` is active, the `return_from` trace message is inhibited.\n\n  _Warning:_ If the traced function is tail-recursive, this match specification\n  function destroys that property. Hence, if a match specification executing\n  this function is used on a perpetual server process, it can only be active for\n  a limited period of time, or the emulator will eventually use all memory in\n  the host machine and crash. If this match specification function is inhibited\n  using process trace flag `silent`, tail-recursiveness still remains.\n\n- **`exception_trace`** - Works as `return_trace` plus; if the traced function\n  exits because of an exception, an `exception_from` trace message is generated,\n  regardless of the exception is caught or not.\n\n- **`process_dump`** - Returns some textual information about the current\n  process as a binary. Takes no arguments and is only allowed in the `MatchBody`\n  part when tracing.\n\n- **`enable_trace`** - Enable a trace flag for a process.\n\n  With one parameter this function turns on tracing like\n  the Erlang call [`trace:process(S, self(), true, [P2])`](`trace:process/4`),\n  where `S` is the current trace session and `P2` is the parameter to\n  `enable_trace`.\n\n  With two parameters, the first parameter is to be either a process identifier\n  or the registered name of a process. In this case tracing is turned on for the\n  designated process in the same way as in the Erlang call\n  [`trace:process(S, P1, true, [P2])`](`trace:process/4`), where `P1` is the\n  first and `P2` is the second argument. `P1` _cannot_ be one of the atoms\n  `all`, `new` or `existing` (unless they are registered names). `P2` _cannot_\n  be `cpu_timestamp` or `tracer`.\n\n  Returns `true` and can only be used in the `MatchBody` part when tracing.\n\n  If used by the legacy function `erlang:trace_pattern/3`, the process `P1` gets\n  its trace messages sent to the same tracer as the process executing the\n  statement uses.\n\n- **`disable_trace`** - Disable a trace flag for a process.\n\n  With one parameter this function disables tracing like\n  the Erlang call [`trace:process(S, self(), false, [P2])`](`trace:process/4`),\n  where `S` is the current trace session and `P2` is the parameter to\n  `disable_trace`.\n\n  With two parameters this function works as the Erlang call\n  [`trace:process(S, P1, false, [P2])`](`trace:process/4`), where `P1` can be\n  either a process identifier or a registered name and is specified as the first\n  argument to the match specification function. `P2` _cannot_ be `cpu_timestamp`\n  or `tracer`.\n\n  Returns `true` and can only be used in the `MatchBody` part when tracing.\n\n- **`trace`** - Enable and/or disable trace flags for a process.\n\n  With two parameters this function takes a list of trace flags to\n  disable as first parameter and a list of trace flags to enable as second\n  parameter. Logically, the disable list is applied first, but effectively all\n  changes are applied atomically. The trace flags are the same as for\n  `trace:process/4`, not including `cpu_timestamp`.\n\n  With three parameters to this function, the first is either a process\n  identifier or the registered name of a process to set trace flags on, the\n  second is the disable list, and the third is the enable list.\n\n  When used via the new `m:trace` API, trace flag `tracer` is not allowed and the\n  receiving tracer is always the tracer of the current session.\n\n  When used via the legacy function `erlang:trace_pattern/3`, trace flag `tracer`\n  is allowed. If no tracer is specified, the same tracer as the process\n  executing the match specification is used (not the meta tracer). If that\n  process doesn't have a tracer either, then trace flags are ignored.\n\n  When using a [tracer module](`m:erl_tracer`), the module must be loaded before\n  the match specification is executed. If it is not loaded, the match fails.\n\n  Returns `true` if any trace property was changed for the trace target process,\n  otherwise `false`. Can only be used in the `MatchBody` part when tracing.\n\n- **`caller`** - Returns the calling function as a tuple\n  `{Module, Function, Arity}` or the atom `undefined` if the calling function\n  cannot be determined. Can only be used in the `MatchBody` part when tracing.\n\n  Notice that if a \"technically built in function\" (that is, a function not\n  written in Erlang) is traced, the `caller` function sometimes returns the atom\n  `undefined`. The calling Erlang function is not available during such calls.\n\n- **`caller_line`** - Similar to `caller` but returns additional information\n  about the source code location of the function call-site within the caller\n  function. Returns the calling function as a tuple\n  `{Module, Function, Arity, {File, Line}}`. `File` is the\n  [string](`e:system:data_types.md#string`) file name while `Line` is source\n  line number. If the `File` and `Line` cannot be determined,\n  `{Module, Function, Arity, undefined}` is returned. If the calling function\n  cannot be determined, the atom `undefined` is returned. Can only be used in\n  the `MatchBody` part when tracing.\n\n  Notice that if a \"technically built in function\" (that is, a function not\n  written in Erlang) is traced, the `caller_line` function sometimes returns the\n  atom `undefined`. The calling Erlang function is not available during such\n  calls.\n\n- **`current_stacktrace`** - Returns the current call stack back-trace\n  ([stacktrace](`t:erlang:stacktrace/0`)) of the calling function. The stack has\n  the same format as in the `catch` part of a `try`. See\n  [The call-stack back trace (stacktrace)](`e:system:errors.md#stacktrace`). The\n  depth of the stacktrace is truncated according to the `backtrace_depth` system\n  flag setting.\n\n  Accepts a depth parameter. The depth value will be `backtrace_depth` if the\n  argument is greater.\n\n- **`display`** - For debugging purposes only. Displays the single argument as\n  an Erlang term on `stdout`, which is seldom what is wanted. Returns `true` and\n  can only be used in the `MatchBody` part when tracing.\n\n- **`get_tcw`{: #get_tcw }** - Takes no argument and returns the value of the\n  node's trace control word. The same is done by\n  `erlang:system_info(trace_control_word)`.\n\n  The trace control word is a 32-bit unsigned integer intended for generic trace\n  control. The trace control word can be tested and set both from within trace\n  match specifications and with BIFs. This call is only allowed when tracing.\n\n- **`set_tcw`{: #set_tcw }** - Takes one unsigned integer argument, sets the\n  value of the node's trace control word to the value of the argument, and\n  returns the previous value. The same is done by\n  `erlang:system_flag(trace_control_word, Value)`. It is only allowed to use\n  `set_tcw` in the `MatchBody` part when tracing.\n\n- **`silent`** - Takes one argument. If the argument is `true`, the call trace\n  message mode for the current process is set to silent for this call and all\n  later calls, that is, call trace messages are inhibited even if\n  `{message, true}` is called in the `MatchBody` part for a traced function.\n\n  This mode can also be activated with flag `silent` to `erlang:trace/3`.\n\n  If the argument is `false`, the call trace message mode for the current\n  process is set to normal (non-silent) for this call and all later calls.\n\n  If the argument is not `true` or `false`, the call trace message mode is\n  unaffected.\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> All \"function calls\" must be tuples, even if they take no arguments.

The information\n> in this section is therefore not directly applicable for older dumps. However,\n> if you use `m:crashdump_viewer` on older dumps, the crash dumps are translated\n> into a format similar to this.\n\nThe system writes the crash dump in the current directory of the emulator or in\nthe file pointed out by the environment variable (whatever that means on the\ncurrent operating system) `ERL_CRASH_DUMP`. For a crash dump to be written, a\nwritable file system must be mounted.\n\nCrash dumps are written mainly for one of two reasons: either the built-in\nfunction `erlang:halt/1` is called explicitly with a string argument from\nrunning Erlang code, or the runtime system has detected an error that cannot be\nhandled. The most usual reason that the system cannot handle the error is that\nthe cause is external limitations, such as running out of memory. A crash dump\ncaused by an internal error can be caused by the system reaching limits in the\nemulator itself (like the number of atoms in the system, or too many\nsimultaneous ETS tables). Usually the emulator or the operating system can be\nreconfigured to avoid the crash, which is why interpreting the crash dump\ncorrectly is important.\n\nOn systems that support OS signals, it is also possible to stop the runtime\nsystem and generate a crash dump by sending the `SIGUSR1` signal.\n\nThe Erlang crash dump is a readable text file, but it can be difficult to read.\nUsing the Crashdump Viewer tool in the `Observer` application simplifies the\ntask. This is a wx-widget-based tool for browsing Erlang crash dumps.","ref":"crash_dump.html"},{"type":"extras","title":"General Information - How to Interpret the Erlang Crash Dumps","doc":"The first part of the crash dump shows the following:\n\n- The creation time for the dump\n- A slogan indicating the reason for the dump\n- The system version of the node from which the dump originates\n- The number of atoms in the atom table\n- The runtime system thread that caused the crash dump","ref":"crash_dump.html#general-information"},{"type":"extras","title":"Reasons for Crash Dumps (Slogan) - How to Interpret the Erlang Crash Dumps","doc":"The reason for the dump is shown in the beginning of the file as:\n\n```text\nSlogan:  \n```\n\nIf the system is halted by the BIF `erlang:halt/1`, the slogan is the string\nparameter passed to the BIF, otherwise it is a description generated by the\nemulator or the (Erlang) kernel. Normally the message is enough to understand\nthe problem, but some messages are described here. Notice that the suggested\nreasons for the crash are _only suggestions_. The exact reasons for the errors\ncan vary depending on the local applications and the underlying operating\nsystem.\n\n- **_ : Cannot allocate   bytes of memory (of type \" \")_** - The system\n  has run out of memory.   is the allocator that failed to allocate memory,\n    is the number of bytes that   tried to allocate, and   is the memory\n  block type that the memory was needed for. The most common case is that a\n  process stores huge amounts of data. In this case   is most often `heap`,\n  `old_heap`, `heap_frag`, or `binary`. For more information on allocators, see\n  [`erts_alloc(3)`](erts_alloc.md).\n\n- **_ : Cannot reallocate   bytes of memory (of type \" \")_** - Same as\n  above except that memory was reallocated instead of allocated when the system\n  ran out of memory.\n\n- **_Unexpected op code  _** - Error in compiled code, `beam` file damaged, or\n  error in the compiler.\n\n- **_Module   undefined `|` Function   undefined `|` No function\n   : /1 `|` No function  :start/2_** - The Kernel/STDLIB\n  applications are damaged or the start script is damaged.\n\n- **_Driver_select called with too large file descriptor `N`_** - The number of\n  file descriptors for sockets exceeds 1024 (Unix only). The limit on file\n  descriptors in some Unix flavors can be set to over 1024, but only 1024\n  sockets/pipes can be used simultaneously by Erlang (because of limitations in\n  the Unix `select` call). The number of open regular files is not affected by\n  this.\n\n- **_Received SIGUSR1_** - Sending the `SIGUSR1` signal to an Erlang machine\n  (Unix only) forces a crash dump. This slogan reflects that the Erlang machine\n  crash-dumped because of receiving that signal.\n\n- **_Kernel pid terminated ( ) ( )_** - The kernel supervisor\n  has detected a failure, usually that the `application_controller` has shut\n  down (`Who` = `application_controller`, `Why` = `shutdown`). The application\n  controller can have shut down for many reasons, the most usual is that the\n  node name of the distributed Erlang node is already in use. A complete\n  supervisor tree \"crash\" (that is, the top supervisors have exited) gives about\n  the same result. This message comes from the Erlang code and not from the\n  virtual machine itself. It is always because of some failure in an\n  application, either within OTP or a \"user-written\" one. Looking at the error\n  log for your application is probably the first step to take.\n\n- **_Init terminating in do_boot ()_** - The primitive Erlang boot sequence was\n  terminated, most probably because the boot script has errors or cannot be\n  read. This is usually a configuration error; the system can have been started\n  with a faulty `-boot` parameter or with a boot script from the wrong OTP\n  version.\n\n- **_Could not start kernel pid ( ) ()_** - One of the kernel processes\n  could not start. This is probably because of faulty arguments (like errors in\n  a `-config` argument) or faulty configuration files. Check that all files are\n  in their correct location and that the configuration files (if any) are not\n  damaged. Usually messages are also written to the controlling terminal and/or\n  the error log explaining what is wrong.\n\nOther errors than these can occur, as the `erlang:halt/1` BIF can generate any\nmessage. If the message is not generated by the BIF and does not occur in the\nlist above, it can be because of an error in the emulator. There can however be\nunusual messages, not mentioned here, which are still connected to an\napplication failure. There is much more information available, so a thorough\nreading of the crash dump can reveal the crash reason. The size of processes,\nthe number of ETS tables, and the Erlang data on each process stack can be\nuseful to find the problem.","ref":"crash_dump.html#reasons-for-crash-dumps-slogan"},{"type":"extras","title":"Number of Atoms - How to Interpret the Erlang Crash Dumps","doc":"The number of atoms in the system at the time of the crash is shown as `Atoms:  `.\nSome ten thousands atoms is perfectly normal, but more can indicate\nthat the BIF `erlang:list_to_atom/1` is used to generate many _different_ atoms\ndynamically, which is never a good idea.","ref":"crash_dump.html#number-of-atoms"},{"type":"extras","title":"Scheduler Information - How to Interpret the Erlang Crash Dumps","doc":"Under the tag _=scheduler_ is shown information about the current state and\nstatistics of the schedulers in the runtime system.

A non-stable driver will affect and/or crash the\nwhole Erlang runtime system.\n\nThe emulator calls the driver in the following situations:\n\n- When the driver is loaded. This callback must have a special name and inform\n  the emulator of what callbacks are to be used by returning a pointer to a\n  `ErlDrvEntry` struct, which is to be properly filled in (see below).\n- When a port to the driver is opened (by a `open_port` call from Erlang). This\n  routine is to set up internal data structures and return an opaque data entity\n  of the type `ErlDrvData`, which is a data type large enough to hold a pointer.\n  The pointer returned by this function is the first argument to all other\n  callbacks concerning this particular port. It is usually called the port\n  handle. The emulator only stores the handle and does never try to interpret\n  it, why it can be virtually anything (anything not larger than a pointer that\n  is) and can point to anything if it is a pointer. Usually this pointer refers\n  to a structure holding information about the particular port, as it does in\n  the example.\n- When an Erlang process sends data to the port. The data arrives as a buffer of\n  bytes, the interpretation is not defined, but is up to the implementor. This\n  callback returns nothing to the caller, answers are sent to the caller as\n  messages (using a routine called `driver_output` available to all drivers).\n  There is also a way to talk in a synchronous way to drivers, described below.\n  There can be an additional callback function for handling data that is\n  fragmented (sent in a deep io-list). That interface gets the data in a form\n  suitable for Unix `writev` rather than in a single buffer. There is no need\n  for a distribution driver to implement such a callback, so we will not.\n- When a file descriptor is signaled for input. This callback is called when the\n  emulator detects input on a file descriptor that the driver has marked for\n  monitoring by using the interface `driver_select`. The mechanism of driver\n  select makes it possible to read non-blocking from file descriptors by calling\n  `driver_select` when reading is needed, and then do the reading in this\n  callback (when reading is possible). The typical scenario is that\n  `driver_select` is called when an Erlang process orders a read operation, and\n  that this routine sends the answer when data is available on the file\n  descriptor.\n- When a file descriptor is signaled for output. This callback is called in a\n  similar way as the previous, but when writing to a file descriptor is\n  possible. The usual scenario is that Erlang orders writing on a file\n  descriptor and that the driver calls `driver_select`. When the descriptor is\n  ready for output, this callback is called and the driver can try to send the\n  output. Queuing can be involved in such operations, and there are convenient\n  queue routines available to the driver writer to use.\n- When a port is closed, either by an Erlang process or by the driver calling\n  one of the `driver_failure_XXX` routines. This routine is to clean up\n  everything connected to one particular port. When other callbacks call a\n  `driver_failure_XXX` routine, this routine is immediately called. The callback\n  routine issuing the error can make no more use of the data structures for the\n  port, as this routine surely has freed all associated data and closed all file\n  descriptors. If the queue utility available to driver writer is used, this\n  routine is however _not_ called until the queue is empty.\n- When an Erlang process calls `erlang:port_control/3`, which is a synchronous\n  interface to drivers. The control interface is used to set driver options,\n  change states of ports, and so on. This interface is used a lot in the\n  example.\n- When a timer expires. The driver can set timers with the function\n  `driver_set_timer`. When such timers expire, a specific callback function is\n  called. No timers are used in the example.\n- When the whole driver is unloaded. Every resource allocated by the driver is\n  to be freed.","ref":"alt_dist.html#drivers-in-general"},{"type":"extras","title":"The Data Structures of the Distribution Driver - How to Implement an Alternative Carrier for the Erlang Distribution","doc":"The driver used for Erlang distribution is to implement a reliable, order\nmaintaining, variable length packet-oriented protocol. All error correction,\nresending and such need to be implemented in the driver or by the underlying\ncommunications protocol. If the protocol is stream-oriented (as is the case with\nboth TCP/IP and our streamed Unix domain sockets), some mechanism for packaging\nis needed. We will use the simple method of having a header of four bytes\ncontaining the length of the package in a big-endian 32-bit integer.

As this driver\nis written for Solaris, we know that the header `uio.h` exists. So the\npreprocessor variable `HAVE_UIO_H` can be defined before `erl_driver.h` is\nincluded on line 12. The definition of `HAVE_UIO_H` will make the I/O vectors\nused in Erlang's driver queues to correspond to the operating systems ditto,\nwhich is very convenient.\n\nOn line 16-23 the different callback functions are declared (\"forward\ndeclarations\").\n\nThe driver structure is similar for statically linked-in drivers and dynamically\nloaded. However, some of the fields are to be left empty (that is, initialized\nto NULL) in the different types of drivers. The first field (the `init` function\npointer) is always left blank in a dynamically loaded driver, see line 26.\n`NULL` on line 37 is always to be there, the field is no longer used and is\nretained for backward compatibility. No timers are used in this driver, why no\ncallback for timers is needed. The `outputv` field (line 40) can be used to\nimplement an interface similar to Unix `writev` for output. The Erlang runtime\nsystem could previously not use `outputv` for the distribution, but it can as\nfrom ERTS 5.7.2. As this driver was written before ERTS 5.7.2 it does not use\nthe `outputv` callback. Using the `outputv` callback is preferred, as it reduces\ncopying of data. (We will however use scatter/gather I/O internally in the\ndriver.)\n\nAs from ERTS 5.5.3 the driver interface was extended with version control and\nthe possibility to pass capability information. Capability flags are present on\nline 48. As from ERTS 5.7.4 flag\n[`ERL_DRV_FLAG_SOFT_BUSY`](driver_entry.md#driver_flags) is required for drivers\nthat are to be used by the distribution. The soft busy flag implies that the\ndriver can handle calls to the `output` and `outputv` callbacks although it has\nmarked itself as busy. This has always been a requirement on drivers used by the\ndistribution, but no capability information has been available about this\npreviously. For more information, see\n[`erl_driver:set_busy_port()`](erl_driver.md#set_busy_port)).\n\nThis driver was written before the runtime system had SMP support. The driver\nwill still function in the runtime system with SMP support, but performance will\nsuffer from lock contention on the driver lock used for the driver. This can be\nalleviated by reviewing and perhaps rewriting the code so that each instance of\nthe driver safely can execute in parallel. When instances safely can execute in\nparallel, it is safe to enable instance-specific locking on the driver. This is\ndone by passing [`ERL_DRV_FLAG_USE_PORT_LOCKING`](driver_entry.md#driver_flags)\nas a driver flag. This is left as an exercise for the reader.\n\nThus, the defined callbacks are as follows:\n\n- **`uds_start`** - Must initiate data for a port. We do not create any sockets\n  here, only initialize data structures.\n\n- **`uds_stop`** - Called when a port is closed.\n\n- **`uds_command`** - Handles messages from Erlang. The messages can either be\n  plain data to be sent or more subtle instructions to the driver. This function\n  is here mostly for data pumping.\n\n- **`uds_input`** - Called when there is something to read from a socket.\n\n- **`uds_output`** - Called when it is possible to write to a socket.\n\n- **`uds_finish`** - Called when the driver is unloaded. A distribution driver\n  will never be unloaded, but we include this for completeness. To be able to\n  clean up after oneself is always a good thing.\n\n- **`uds_control`** - The `erlang:port_control/3` callback, which is used a lot\n  in this implementation.\n\nThe ports implemented by this driver operate in two major modes, named `command`\nand `data`. In `command` mode, only passive reading and writing (like\n`gen_tcp:recv`/`gen_tcp:send`) can be done. The port is in this mode during the\ndistribution handshake. When the connection is up, the port is switched to\n`data` mode and all data is immediately read and passed further to the Erlang\nemulator. In `data` mode, no data arriving to `uds_command` is interpreted, only\npackaged and sent out on the socket. The `uds_control` callback does the\nswitching between those two modes.\n\nWhile `net_kernel` informs different subsystems that the connection is coming\nup, the port is to accept data to send. However, the port should not receive any\ndata, to avoid that data arrives from another node before every kernel subsystem\nis prepared to handle it. A third mode, named `intermediate`, is used for this\nintermediate stage.\n\nAn enum is defined for the different types of ports:\n\n```c\n( 1) typedef enum {\n( 2)     portTypeUnknown,      /* An uninitialized port */\n( 3)     portTypeListener,     /* A listening port/socket */\n( 4)     portTypeAcceptor,     /* An intermediate stage when accepting\n( 5)                              on a listen port */\n( 6)     portTypeConnector,    /* An intermediate stage when connecting */\n( 7)     portTypeCommand,      /* A connected open port in command mode */\n( 8)     portTypeIntermediate, /* A connected open port in special\n( 9)                              half active mode */\n(10)     portTypeData          /* A connected open port in data mode */\n(11) } PortType;\n```\n\nThe different types are as follows:\n\n- **`portTypeUnknown`** - The type a port has when it is opened, but not bound\n  to any file descriptor.\n\n- **`portTypeListener`** - A port that is connected to a listen socket. This\n  port does not do much, no data pumping is done on this socket, but read data\n  is available when one is trying to do an accept on the port.\n\n- **`portTypeAcceptor`** - This port is to represent the result of an accept\n  operation. It is created when one wants to accept from a listen socket, and it\n  is converted to a `portTypeCommand` when the accept succeeds.\n\n- **`portTypeConnector`** - Very similar to `portTypeAcceptor`, an intermediate\n  stage between the request for a connect operation and that the socket is\n  connected to an accepting ditto in the other end. When the sockets are\n  connected, the port switches type to `portTypeCommand`.\n\n- **`portTypeCommand`** - A connected socket (or accepted socket) in `command`\n  mode mentioned earlier.\n\n- **`portTypeIntermediate`** - The intermediate stage for a connected socket.\n  There is to be no processing of input for this socket.\n\n- **`portTypeData`** - The mode where data is pumped through the port and the\n  `uds_command` routine regards every call as a call where sending is wanted. In\n  this mode, all input available is read and sent to Erlang when it arrives on\n  the socket, much like in the active mode of a `gen_tcp` socket.\n\nWe study the state that is needed for the ports. Notice that not all fields are\nused for all types of ports. Some space could be saved by using unions, but that\nwould clutter the code with multiple indirections, so here is used one struct\nfor all types of ports, for readability:\n\n```c\n( 1) typedef unsigned char Byte;\n( 2) typedef unsigned int Word;\n\n( 3) typedef struct uds_data {\n( 4)     int fd;                   /* File descriptor */\n( 5)     ErlDrvPort port;          /* The port identifier */\n( 6)     int lockfd;               /* The file descriptor for a lock file in\n( 7)                                  case of listen sockets */\n( 8)     Byte creation;            /* The creation serial derived from the\n( 9)                                  lock file */\n(10)     PortType type;            /* Type of port */\n(11)     char *name;               /* Short name of socket for unlink */\n(12)     Word sent;                /* Bytes sent */\n(13)     Word received;            /* Bytes received */\n(14)     struct uds_data *partner; /* The partner in an accept/listen pair */\n(15)     struct uds_data *next;    /* Next structure in list */\n(16)     /* The input buffer and its data */\n(17)     int buffer_size;          /* The allocated size of the input buffer */\n(18)     int buffer_pos;           /* Current position in input buffer */\n(19)     int header_pos;           /* Where the current header is in the\n(20)                                  input buffer */\n(21)     Byte *buffer;             /* The actual input buffer */\n(22) } UdsData;\n```\n\nThis structure is used for all types of ports although some fields are useless\nfor some types. The least memory consuming solution would be to arrange this\nstructure as a union of structures. However, the multiple indirections in the\ncode to access a field in such a structure would clutter the code too much for\nan example.\n\nThe fields in the structure are as follows:\n\n- **`fd`** - The file descriptor of the socket associated with the port.\n\n- **`port`** - The port identifier for the port that this structure corresponds\n  to. It is needed for most `driver_XXX` calls from the driver back to the\n  emulator.\n\n- **`lockfd`** - If the socket is a listen socket, we use a separate (regular)\n  file for two purposes:\n\n  - We want a locking mechanism that gives no race conditions, to be sure if\n    another Erlang node uses the listen socket name we require or if the file is\n    only left there from a previous (crashed) session.\n  - We store the `creation` serial number in the file. The `creation` is a\n    number that is to change between different instances of different Erlang\n    emulators with the same name, so that process identifiers from one emulator\n    do not become valid when sent to a new emulator with the same distribution\n    name. The creation can be from 0 through 3 (two bits) and is stored in every\n    process identifier sent to another node.\n\n    In a system with TCP-based distribution, this data is kept in the _Erlang\n    port mapper daemon_ (`epmd`), which is contacted when a distributed node\n    starts. The lock file and a convention for the UDS listen socket's name\n    remove the need for `epmd` when using this distribution module. UDS is\n    always restricted to one host, why avoiding a port mapper is easy.\n\n- **`creation`** - The creation number for a listen socket, which is calculated\n  as (the value found in the lock-file + 1) rem 4. This creation value is also\n  written back into the lock file, so that the next invocation of the emulator\n  finds our value in the file.\n\n- **`type`** - The current type/state of the port, which can be one of the\n  values declared above.\n\n- **`name`** - The name of the socket file (the path prefix removed), which\n  allows for deletion (`unlink`) when the socket is closed.\n\n- **`sent`** - How many bytes that have been sent over the socket. This can\n  wrap, but that is no problem for the distribution, as the Erlang distribution\n  is only interested in if this value has changed. (The Erlang `net_kernel`\n  `ticker` uses this value by calling the driver to fetch it, which is done\n  through the `erlang:port_control/3` routine.)\n\n- **`received`** - How many bytes that are read (received) from the socket, used\n  in similar ways as `sent`.\n\n- **`partner`** - A pointer to another port structure, which is either the\n  listen port from which this port is accepting a connection or conversely. The\n  \"partner relation\" is always bidirectional.\n\n- **`next`** - Pointer to next structure in a linked list of all port\n  structures. This list is used when accepting connections and when the driver\n  is unloaded.\n\n- **`buffer_size`, `buffer_pos`, `header_pos`, `buffer`** - Data for input\n  buffering. For details about the input buffering, see the source code in\n  directory `kernel/examples`. That certainly goes beyond the scope of this\n  section.","ref":"alt_dist.html#the-data-structures-of-the-distribution-driver"},{"type":"extras","title":"Selected Parts of the Distribution Driver Implementation - How to Implement an Alternative Carrier for the Erlang Distribution","doc":"The implementation of the distribution driver is not completely covered here,\ndetails about buffering and other things unrelated to driver writing are not\nexplained. Likewise are some peculiarities of the UDS protocol not explained in\ndetail. The chosen protocol is not important.\n\nPrototypes for the driver callback routines can be found in the `erl_driver.h`\nheader file.\n\nThe driver initialization routine is (usually) declared with a macro to make the\ndriver easier to port between different operating systems (and flavors of\nsystems). This is the only routine that must have a well-defined name. All other\ncallbacks are reached through the driver structure. The macro to use is named\n`DRIVER_INIT` and takes the driver name as parameter:\n\n```c\n(1) /* Beginning of linked list of ports */\n(2) static UdsData *first_data;\n\n(3) DRIVER_INIT(uds_drv)\n(4) {\n(5)     first_data = NULL;\n(6)     return &uds_driver_entry;\n(7) }\n```\n\nThe routine initializes the single global data structure and returns a pointer\nto the driver entry. The routine is called when `erl_ddll:load_driver` is called\nfrom Erlang.\n\nThe `uds_start` routine is called when a port is opened from Erlang. In this\ncase, we only allocate a structure and initialize it. Creating the actual socket\nis left to the `uds_command` routine.\n\n```c\n( 1) static ErlDrvData uds_start(ErlDrvPort port, char *buff)\n( 2) {\n( 3)     UdsData *ud;\n( 4)\n( 5)     ud = ALLOC(sizeof(UdsData));\n( 6)     ud->fd = -1;\n( 7)     ud->lockfd = -1;\n( 8)     ud->creation = 0;\n( 9)     ud->port = port;\n(10)     ud->type = portTypeUnknown;\n(11)     ud->name = NULL;\n(12)     ud->buffer_size = 0;\n(13)     ud->buffer_pos = 0;\n(14)     ud->header_pos = 0;\n(15)     ud->buffer = NULL;\n(16)     ud->sent = 0;\n(17)     ud->received = 0;\n(18)     ud->partner = NULL;\n(19)     ud->next = first_data;\n(20)     first_data = ud;\n(21)\n(22)     return((ErlDrvData) ud);\n(23) }\n```\n\nEvery data item is initialized, so that no problems arise when a newly created\nport is closed (without there being any corresponding socket). This routine is\ncalled when [`open_port({spawn, \"uds_drv\"},[])`](`open_port/2`) is called from\nErlang.\n\nThe `uds_command` routine is the routine called when an Erlang process sends\ndata to the port. This routine handles all asynchronous commands when the port\nis in `command` mode and the sending of all data when the port is in `data`\nmode:\n\n```c\n( 1) static void uds_command(ErlDrvData handle, char *buff, int bufflen)\n( 2) {\n( 3)     UdsData *ud = (UdsData *) handle;\n\n( 4)     if (ud->type == portTypeData || ud->type == portTypeIntermediate) {\n( 5)         DEBUGF((\"Passive do_send %d\",bufflen));\n( 6)         do_send(ud, buff + 1, bufflen - 1); /* XXX */\n( 7)         return;\n( 8)     }\n( 9)     if (bufflen == 0) {\n(10)         return;\n(11)     }\n(12)     switch (*buff) {\n(13)     case 'L':\n(14)         if (ud->type != portTypeUnknown) {\n(15)             driver_failure_posix(ud->port, ENOTSUP);\n(16)             return;\n(17)         }\n(18)         uds_command_listen(ud,buff,bufflen);\n(19)         return;\n(20)     case 'A':\n(21)         if (ud->type != portTypeUnknown) {\n(22)             driver_failure_posix(ud->port, ENOTSUP);\n(23)             return;\n(24)         }\n(25)         uds_command_accept(ud,buff,bufflen);\n(26)         return;\n(27)     case 'C':\n(28)         if (ud->type != portTypeUnknown) {\n(29)             driver_failure_posix(ud->port, ENOTSUP);\n(30)             return;\n(31)         }\n(32)         uds_command_connect(ud,buff,bufflen);\n(33)         return;\n(34)     case 'S':\n(35)         if (ud->type != portTypeCommand) {\n(36)             driver_failure_posix(ud->port, ENOTSUP);\n(37)             return;\n(38)         }\n(39)         do_send(ud, buff + 1, bufflen - 1);\n(40)         return;\n(41)     case 'R':\n(42)         if (ud->type != portTypeCommand) {\n(43)             driver_failure_posix(ud->port, ENOTSUP);\n(44)             return;\n(45)         }\n(46)         do_recv(ud);\n(47)         return;\n(48)     default:\n(49)         return;\n(50)     }\n(51) }\n```\n\nThe command routine takes three parameters; the handle returned for the port by\n`uds_start`, which is a pointer to the internal port structure, the data buffer,\nand the length of the data buffer. The buffer is the data sent from Erlang (a\nlist of bytes) converted to an C array (of bytes).\n\nIf Erlang sends, for example, the list `[$a,$b,$c]` to the port, the `bufflen`\nvariable is `3` and the `buff` variable contains `{'a','b','c'}` (no `NULL`\ntermination). Usually the first byte is used as an opcode, which is the case in\nthis driver too (at least when the port is in `command` mode). The opcodes are\ndefined as follows:\n\n- **`'L' `** - Creates and listens on socket with the specified\n  name.\n\n- **`'A' `** - Accepts from the listen socket\n  identified by the specified identification number. The identification number\n  is retrieved with the `uds_control` routine.\n\n- **`'C' `** - Connects to the socket named  .\n\n- **`'S' `** - Sends the data   on the connected/accepted socket (in\n  `command` mode). The sending is acknowledged when the data has left this\n  process.\n\n- **`'R'`** - Receives one packet of data.\n\n\"One packet of data\" in command `'R'` can be explained as follows. This driver\nalways sends data packaged with a 4 byte header containing a big-endian 32-bit\ninteger that represents the length of the data in the packet. There is no need\nfor different packet sizes or some kind of streamed mode, as this driver is for\nthe distribution only. Why is the header word coded explicitly in big-endian\nwhen a UDS socket is local to the host? It is good practice when writing a\ndistribution driver, as distribution in practice usually crosses the host\nboundaries.\n\nOn line 4-8 is handled the case where the port is in `data` mode or\n`intermediate` mode and the remaining routine handles the different commands.\nThe routine uses the `driver_failure_posix()` routine to report errors (see, for\nexample, line 15). Notice that the failure routines make a call to the\n`uds_stop` routine, which will remove the internal port data. The handle (and\nthe casted handle `ud`) is therefore _invalid pointers_ after a `driver_failure`\ncall and we should _return immediately_. The runtime system will send exit\nsignals to all linked processes.\n\nThe `uds_input` routine is called when data is available on a file descriptor\npreviously passed to the `driver_select` routine. This occurs typically when a\nread command is issued and no data is available. The `do_recv` routine is as\nfollows:\n\n```c\n( 1) static void do_recv(UdsData *ud)\n( 2) {\n( 3)     int res;\n( 4)     char *ibuf;\n( 5)     for(;;) {\n( 6)         if ((res = buffered_read_package(ud,&ibuf)) < 0) {\n( 7)             if (res == NORMAL_READ_FAILURE) {\n( 8)                 driver_select(ud->port, (ErlDrvEvent) ud->fd, DO_READ, 1);\n( 9)             } else {\n(10)                 driver_failure_eof(ud->port);\n(11)             }\n(12)             return;\n(13)         }\n(14)         /* Got a package */\n(15)         if (ud->type == portTypeCommand) {\n(16)             ibuf[-1] = 'R'; /* There is always room for a single byte\n(17)                                opcode before the actual buffer\n(18)                                (where the packet header was) */\n(19)             driver_output(ud->port,ibuf - 1, res + 1);\n(20)             driver_select(ud->port, (ErlDrvEvent) ud->fd, DO_READ,0);\n(21)             return;\n(22)         } else {\n(23)             ibuf[-1] = DIST_MAGIC_RECV_TAG; /* XXX */\n(24)             driver_output(ud->port,ibuf - 1, res + 1);\n(25)             driver_select(ud->port, (ErlDrvEvent) ud->fd, DO_READ,1);\n(26)         }\n(27)     }\n(28) }\n```\n\nThe routine tries to read data until a packet is read or the\n`buffered_read_package` routine returns a `NORMAL_READ_FAILURE` (an internally\ndefined constant for the module, which means that the read operation resulted in\nan `EWOULDBLOCK`). If the port is in `command` mode, the reading stops when one\npackage is read. If the port is in `data` mode, the reading continues until the\nsocket buffer is empty (read failure). If no more data can be read and more is\nwanted (which is always the case when the socket is in `data` mode),\n`driver_select` is called to make the `uds_input` callback be called when more\ndata is available for reading.\n\nWhen the port is in `data` mode, all data is sent to Erlang in a format that\nsuits the distribution. In fact, the raw data will never reach any Erlang\nprocess, but will be translated/interpreted by the emulator itself and then\ndelivered in the correct format to the correct processes. In the current\nemulator version, received data is to be tagged with a single byte of 100. That\nis what the macro `DIST_MAGIC_RECV_TAG` is defined to. The tagging of data in\nthe distribution can be changed in the future.\n\nThe `uds_input` routine handles other input events (like non-blocking `accept`),\nbut most importantly handle data arriving at the socket by calling `do_recv`:\n\n```c\n( 1) static void uds_input(ErlDrvData handle, ErlDrvEvent event)\n( 2) {\n( 3)     UdsData *ud = (UdsData *) handle;\n\n( 4)     if (ud->type == portTypeListener) {\n( 5)         UdsData *ad = ud->partner;\n( 6)         struct sockaddr_un peer;\n( 7)         int pl = sizeof(struct sockaddr_un);\n( 8)         int fd;\n\n( 9)         if ((fd = accept(ud->fd, (struct sockaddr *) &peer, &pl)) < 0) {\n(10)             if (errno != EWOULDBLOCK) {\n(11)                 driver_failure_posix(ud->port, errno);\n(12)                 return;\n(13)             }\n(14)             return;\n(15)         }\n(16)         SET_NONBLOCKING(fd);\n(17)         ad->fd = fd;\n(18)         ad->partner = NULL;\n(19)         ad->type = portTypeCommand;\n(20)         ud->partner = NULL;\n(21)         driver_select(ud->port, (ErlDrvEvent) ud->fd, DO_READ, 0);\n(22)         driver_output(ad->port, \"Aok\",3);\n(23)         return;\n(24)     }\n(25)     do_recv(ud);\n(26) }\n```\n\nThe important line is the last line in the function: the `do_read` routine is\ncalled to handle new input. The remaining function handles input on a listen\nsocket, which means that it is to be possible to do an accept on the socket,\nwhich is also recognized as a read event.\n\nThe output mechanisms are similar to the input. The `do_send` routine is as\nfollows:\n\n```c\n( 1) static void do_send(UdsData *ud, char *buff, int bufflen)\n( 2) {\n( 3)     char header[4];\n( 4)     int written;\n( 5)     SysIOVec iov[2];\n( 6)     ErlIOVec eio;\n( 7)     ErlDrvBinary *binv[] = {NULL,NULL};\n\n( 8)     put_packet_length(header, bufflen);\n( 9)     iov[0].iov_base = (char *) header;\n(10)     iov[0].iov_len = 4;\n(11)     iov[1].iov_base = buff;\n(12)     iov[1].iov_len = bufflen;\n(13)     eio.iov = iov;\n(14)     eio.binv = binv;\n(15)     eio.vsize = 2;\n(16)     eio.size = bufflen + 4;\n(17)     written = 0;\n(18)     if (driver_sizeq(ud->port) == 0) {\n(19)         if ((written = writev(ud->fd, iov, 2)) == eio.size) {\n(20)             ud->sent += written;\n(21)             if (ud->type == portTypeCommand) {\n(22)                 driver_output(ud->port, \"Sok\", 3);\n(23)             }\n(24)             return;\n(25)         } else if (written < 0) {\n(26)             if (errno != EWOULDBLOCK) {\n(27)                 driver_failure_eof(ud->port);\n(28)                 return;\n(29)             } else {\n(30)                 written = 0;\n(31)             }\n(32)         } else {\n(33)             ud->sent += written;\n(34)         }\n(35)         /* Enqueue remaining */\n(36)     }\n(37)     driver_enqv(ud->port, &eio, written);\n(38)     send_out_queue(ud);\n(39) }\n```\n\nThis driver uses the `writev` system call to send data onto the socket. A\ncombination of `writev` and the driver output queues is very convenient. An\n`ErlIOVec` structure contains a `SysIOVec` (which is equivalent to the\n`struct iovec` structure defined in `uio.h`. The `ErlIOVec` also contains an\narray of `ErlDrvBinary` pointers, of the same length as the number of buffers in\nthe I/O vector itself. One can use this to allocate the binaries for the queue\n\"manually\" in the driver, but here the binary array is filled with `NULL` values\n(line 7). The runtime system then allocates its own buffers when `driver_enqv`\nis called (line 37).\n\nThe routine builds an I/O vector containing the header bytes and the buffer (the\nopcode has been removed and the buffer length decreased by the output routine).\nIf the queue is empty, we write the data directly to the socket (or at least try\nto). If any data is left, it is stored in the queue and then we try to send the\nqueue (line 38). An acknowledgement is sent when the message is delivered\ncompletely (line 22). The `send_out_queue` sends acknowledgements if the sending\nis completed there. If the port is in `command` mode, the Erlang code serializes\nthe send operations so that only one packet can be waiting for delivery at a\ntime. Therefore the acknowledgement can be sent whenever the queue is empty.\n\nThe `send_out_queue` routine is as follows:\n\n```c\n( 1) static int send_out_queue(UdsData *ud)\n( 2) {\n( 3)     for(;;) {\n( 4)         int vlen;\n( 5)         SysIOVec *tmp = driver_peekq(ud->port, &vlen);\n( 6)         int wrote;\n( 7)         if (tmp == NULL) {\n( 8)             driver_select(ud->port, (ErlDrvEvent) ud->fd, DO_WRITE, 0);\n( 9)             if (ud->type == portTypeCommand) {\n(10)                 driver_output(ud->port, \"Sok\", 3);\n(11)             }\n(12)             return 0;\n(13)         }\n(14)         if (vlen > IO_VECTOR_MAX) {\n(15)             vlen = IO_VECTOR_MAX;\n(16)         }\n(17)         if ((wrote = writev(ud->fd, tmp, vlen)) < 0) {\n(18)             if (errno == EWOULDBLOCK) {\n(19)                 driver_select(ud->port, (ErlDrvEvent) ud->fd,\n(20)                               DO_WRITE, 1);\n(21)                 return 0;\n(22)             } else {\n(23)                 driver_failure_eof(ud->port);\n(24)                 return -1;\n(25)             }\n(26)         }\n(27)         driver_deq(ud->port, wrote);\n(28)         ud->sent += wrote;\n(29)     }\n(30) }\n```\n\nWe simply pick out an I/O vector from the queue (which is the whole queue as a\n`SysIOVec`). If the I/O vector is too long (`IO_VECTOR_MAX` is defined to 16),\nthe vector length is decreased (line 15), otherwise the `writev` call (line 17)\nfails. Writing is tried and anything written is dequeued (line 27). If the write\nfails with `EWOULDBLOCK` (notice that all sockets are in non-blocking mode),\n`driver_select` is called to make the `uds_output` routine be called when there\nis space to write again.\n\nWe continue trying to write until the queue is empty or the writing blocks.\n\nThe routine above is called from the `uds_output` routine:\n\n```c\n( 1) static void uds_output(ErlDrvData handle, ErlDrvEvent event)\n( 2) {\n( 3)    UdsData *ud = (UdsData *) handle;\n( 4)    if (ud->type == portTypeConnector) {\n( 5)        ud->type = portTypeCommand;\n( 6)        driver_select(ud->port, (ErlDrvEvent) ud->fd, DO_WRITE, 0);\n( 7)        driver_output(ud->port, \"Cok\",3);\n( 8)        return;\n( 9)    }\n(10)    send_out_queue(ud);\n(11) }\n```\n\nThe routine is simple: it first handles the fact that the output select will\nconcern a socket in the business of connecting (and the connecting blocked). If\nthe socket is in a connected state, it simply sends the output queue. This\nroutine is called when it is possible to write to a socket where we have an\noutput queue, so there is no question what to do.\n\nThe driver implements a control interface, which is a synchronous interface\ncalled when Erlang calls `erlang:port_control/3`. Only this interface can\ncontrol the driver when it is in `data` mode. It can be called with the\nfollowing opcodes:\n\n- **`'C'`** - Sets port in `command` mode.\n\n- **`'I'`** - Sets port in `intermediate` mode.\n\n- **`'D'`** - Sets port in `data` mode.\n\n- **`'N'`** - Gets identification number for listen port. This identification\n  number is used in an accept command to the driver. It is returned as a\n  big-endian 32-bit integer, which is the file identifier for the listen socket.\n\n- **`'S'`** - Gets statistics, which is the number of bytes received, the number\n  of bytes sent, and the number of bytes pending in the output queue. This data\n  is used when the distribution checks that a connection is alive (ticking). The\n  statistics is returned as three 32-bit big-endian integers.\n\n- **`'T'`** - Sends a tick message, which is a packet of length 0. Ticking is\n  done when the port is in `data` mode, so the command for sending data cannot\n  be used (besides it ignores zero length packages in `command` mode). This is\n  used by the ticker to send dummy data when no other traffic is present.\n\n  _Note:_ It is important that the interface for sending ticks is not blocking.\n  This implementation uses `erlang:port_control/3`, which does not block the\n  caller. If `erlang:port_command` is used, use `erlang:port_command/3` and pass\n  `[force]` as option list; otherwise the caller can be blocked indefinitely on\n  a busy port and prevent the system from taking down a connection that is not\n  functioning.\n\n- **`'R'`** - Gets creation number of a listen socket, which is used to dig out\n  the number stored in the lock file to differentiate between invocations of\n  Erlang nodes with the same name.\n\nThe control interface gets a buffer to return its value in, but is free to\nallocate its own buffer if the provided one is too small.

Postgres is used because it is free and open source.\nFor information on postgres, see [www.postgres.org](http://www.postgres.org).\n\nThe driver is synchronous, it uses the synchronous calls of the client library.\nThis is only for simplicity, but not good, as it halts the emulator while\nwaiting for the database. This is improved below with an asynchronous sample\ndriver.\n\nThe code is straightforward: all communication between Erlang and the driver is\ndone with [`port_control/3`](`port_control/3`), and the driver returns data back\nusing the `rbuf`.\n\nAn Erlang driver only exports one function: the driver entry function. This is\ndefined with a macro, `DRIVER_INIT`, which returns a pointer to a C `struct`\ncontaining the entry points that are called from the emulator. The `struct`\ndefines the entries that the emulator calls to call the driver, with a `NULL`\npointer for entries that are not defined and used by the driver.\n\nThe `start` entry is called when the driver is opened as a port with\n[`open_port/2`](`open_port/2`). Here we allocate memory for a user data\nstructure. This user data is passed every time the emulator calls us. First we\nstore the driver handle, as it is needed in later calls. We allocate memory for\nthe connection handle that is used by LibPQ. We also set the port to return\nallocated driver binaries, by setting flag `PORT_CONTROL_FLAG_BINARY`, calling\n`set_port_control_flags`. (This is because we do not know if our data will fit\nin the result buffer of `control`, which has a default size, 64 bytes, set up by\nthe emulator.)\n\nAn entry `init` is called when the driver is loaded. However, we do not use\nthis, as it is executed only once, and we want to have the possibility of\nseveral instances of the driver.\n\nThe `stop` entry is called when the port is closed.\n\nThe `control` entry is called from the emulator when the Erlang code calls\n[`port_control/3`](`port_control/3`), to do the actual work. We have defined a\nsimple set of commands: `connect` to log in to the database, `disconnect` to log\nout, and `select` to send a SQL-query and get the result. All results are\nreturned through `rbuf`. The library [`ei`] in [`erl_interface`](`e:erl_interface:index.html`)\nis used to encode data in binary term format. The result is returned to the emulator as binary\nterms, so `binary_to_term` is called in Erlang to convert the result to term\nform.\n\nThe code is available in `pg_sync.c` in the `sample` directory of `erts`.\n\nThe driver entry contains the functions that will be called by the emulator. In\nthis example, only [`start`], [`stop`], and [`control`] are provided:\n\n```c\n/* Driver interface declarations */\nstatic ErlDrvData start(ErlDrvPort port, char *command);\nstatic void stop(ErlDrvData drv_data);\nstatic int control(ErlDrvData drv_data, unsigned int command, char *buf,\n                   int len, char **rbuf, int rlen);\n\nstatic ErlDrvEntry pq_driver_entry = {\n    NULL,                        /* init */\n    start,\n    stop,\n    NULL,                        /* output */\n    NULL,                        /* ready_input */\n    NULL,                        /* ready_output */\n    \"pg_sync\",                   /* the name of the driver */\n    NULL,                        /* finish */\n    NULL,                        /* handle */\n    control,\n    NULL,                        /* timeout */\n    NULL,                        /* outputv */\n    NULL,                        /* ready_async */\n    NULL,                        /* flush */\n    NULL,                        /* call */\n    NULL                         /* event */\n};\n```\n\nWe have a structure to store state needed by the driver, in this case we only\nneed to keep the database connection:\n\n```c\ntypedef struct our_data_s {\n    PGconn* conn;\n} our_data_t;\n```\n\nThe control codes that we have defined are as follows:\n\n```c\n/* Keep the following definitions in alignment with the\n * defines in erl_pq_sync.erl\n */\n\n#define DRV_CONNECT             'C'\n#define DRV_DISCONNECT          'D'\n#define DRV_SELECT              'S'\n```\n\nThis returns the driver structure. The macro [`DRIVER_INIT`] defines the only\nexported function. All the other functions are static, and will not be exported\nfrom the library.\n\n```c\n/* INITIALIZATION AFTER LOADING */\n\n/*\n * This is the init function called after this driver has been loaded.\n * It must *not* be declared static. Must return the address to\n * the driver entry.\n */\n\nDRIVER_INIT(pq_drv)\n{\n    return &pq_driver_entry;\n}\n```\n\nHere some initialization is done, [`start`] is called from `open_port/2`. The data\nwill be passed to [`control`] and [`stop`].\n\n```c\n/* DRIVER INTERFACE */\nstatic ErlDrvData start(ErlDrvPort port, char *command)\n{\n    our_data_t* data;\n\n    data = (our_data_t*)driver_alloc(sizeof(our_data_t));\n    data->conn = NULL;\n    set_port_control_flags(port, PORT_CONTROL_FLAG_BINARY);\n    return (ErlDrvData)data;\n}\n```\n\nWe call disconnect to log out from the database. (This should have been done\nfrom Erlang, but just in case.)\n\n```c\nstatic int do_disconnect(our_data_t* data, ei_x_buff* x);\n\nstatic void stop(ErlDrvData drv_data)\n{\n    our_data_t* data = (our_data_t*)drv_data;\n\n    do_disconnect(data, NULL);\n    driver_free(data);\n}\n```\n\nWe use the binary format only to return data to the emulator; input data is a\nstring parameter for `connect` and `select`. The returned data consists of\nErlang terms.\n\nThe functions `get_s` and `ei_x_to_new_binary` are utilities that are used to\nmake the code shorter. `get_s` duplicates the string and zero-terminates it, as\nthe postgres client library wants that. `ei_x_to_new_binary` takes an\n`ei_x_buff` buffer, allocates a binary, and copies the data there. This binary\nis returned in `*rbuf`. (Notice that this binary is freed by the emulator, not\nby us.)\n\n```c\nstatic char* get_s(const char* buf, int len);\nstatic int do_connect(const char *s, our_data_t* data, ei_x_buff* x);\nstatic int do_select(const char* s, our_data_t* data, ei_x_buff* x);\n\n/* As we are operating in binary mode, the return value from control\n * is irrelevant, as long as it is not negative.\n */\nstatic int control(ErlDrvData drv_data, unsigned int command, char *buf,\n                   int len, char **rbuf, int rlen)\n{\n    int r;\n    ei_x_buff x;\n    our_data_t* data = (our_data_t*)drv_data;\n    char* s = get_s(buf, len);\n    ei_x_new_with_version(&x);\n    switch (command) {\n        case DRV_CONNECT:    r = do_connect(s, data, &x);  break;\n        case DRV_DISCONNECT: r = do_disconnect(data, &x);  break;\n        case DRV_SELECT:     r = do_select(s, data, &x);   break;\n        default:             r = -1;        break;\n    }\n    *rbuf = (char*)ei_x_to_new_binary(&x);\n    ei_x_free(&x);\n    driver_free(s);\n    return r;\n}\n```\n\n`do_connect` is where we log in to the database. If the connection was\nsuccessful, we store the connection handle in the driver data, and return\n`'ok'`. Otherwise, we return the error message from postgres and store `NULL` in\nthe driver data.\n\n```c\nstatic int do_connect(const char *s, our_data_t* data, ei_x_buff* x)\n{\n    PGconn* conn = PQconnectdb(s);\n    if (PQstatus(conn) != CONNECTION_OK) {\n        encode_error(x, conn);\n        PQfinish(conn);\n        conn = NULL;\n    } else {\n        encode_ok(x);\n    }\n    data->conn = conn;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIf we are connected (and if the connection handle is not `NULL`), we log out\nfrom the database. We need to check if we should encode an `'ok'`, as we can get\nhere from function [`stop`], which does not return data to the emulator:\n\n```c\nstatic int do_disconnect(our_data_t* data, ei_x_buff* x)\n{\n    if (data->conn == NULL)\n        return 0;\n    PQfinish(data->conn);\n    data->conn = NULL;\n    if (x != NULL)\n        encode_ok(x);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nWe execute a query and encode the result. Encoding is done in another C module,\n`pg_encode.c`, which is also provided as sample code.\n\n```c\nstatic int do_select(const char* s, our_data_t* data, ei_x_buff* x)\n{\n   PGresult* res = PQexec(data->conn, s);\n    encode_result(x, res, data->conn);\n    PQclear(res);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nHere we check the result from postgres. If it is data, we encode it as lists of\nlists with column data. Everything from postgres is C strings, so we use\n[`ei_x_encode_string`] to send the result as strings to Erlang. (The head of the\nlist contains the column names.)\n\n```c\nvoid encode_result(ei_x_buff* x, PGresult* res, PGconn* conn)\n{\n    int row, n_rows, col, n_cols;\n    switch (PQresultStatus(res)) {\n    case PGRES_TUPLES_OK:\n        n_rows = PQntuples(res);\n        n_cols = PQnfields(res);\n        ei_x_encode_tuple_header(x, 2);\n        encode_ok(x);\n        ei_x_encode_list_header(x, n_rows+1);\n        ei_x_encode_list_header(x, n_cols);\n        for (col = 0; col < n_cols; ++col) {\n            ei_x_encode_string(x, PQfname(res, col));\n        }\n        ei_x_encode_empty_list(x);\n        for (row = 0; row < n_rows; ++row) {\n            ei_x_encode_list_header(x, n_cols);\n            for (col = 0; col < n_cols; ++col) {\n                ei_x_encode_string(x, PQgetvalue(res, row, col));\n            }\n            ei_x_encode_empty_list(x);\n        }\n        ei_x_encode_empty_list(x);\n        break;\n    case PGRES_COMMAND_OK:\n        ei_x_encode_tuple_header(x, 2);\n        encode_ok(x);\n        ei_x_encode_string(x, PQcmdTuples(res));\n        break;\n    default:\n        encode_error(x, conn);\n        break;\n    }\n}\n```","ref":"driver.html#sample-driver"},{"type":"extras","title":"Compiling and Linking the Sample Driver - How to Implement a Driver","doc":"The driver is to be compiled and linked to a shared library (DLL on Windows).\nWith gcc, this is done with link flags `-shared` and `-fpic`.

(We trust that the\nterms returned from the driver are well-formed, otherwise the `binary_to_term/1`\ncalls could be contained in a `catch`.)","ref":"driver.html#calling-a-driver-as-a-port-in-erlang"},{"type":"extras","title":"Sample Asynchronous Driver - How to Implement a Driver","doc":"Sometimes database queries can take a long time to complete, in our `pg_sync`\ndriver, the emulator halts while the driver is doing its job. This is often not\nacceptable, as no other Erlang process gets a chance to do anything. To improve\non our postgres driver, we re-implement it using the asynchronous calls in\nLibPQ.\n\nThe asynchronous version of the driver is in the sample files `pg_async.c` and\n`pg_asyng.erl`.\n\n```c\n/* Driver interface declarations */\nstatic ErlDrvData start(ErlDrvPort port, char *command);\nstatic void stop(ErlDrvData drv_data);\nstatic int control(ErlDrvData drv_data, unsigned int command, char *buf,\n                   int len, char **rbuf, int rlen);\nstatic void ready_io(ErlDrvData drv_data, ErlDrvEvent event);\n\nstatic ErlDrvEntry pq_driver_entry = {\n    NULL,                     /* init */\n    start,\n    stop,\n    NULL,                     /* output */\n    ready_io,                 /* ready_input */\n    ready_io,                 /* ready_output */\n    \"pg_async\",               /* the name of the driver */\n    NULL,                     /* finish */\n    NULL,                     /* handle */\n    control,\n    NULL,                     /* timeout */\n    NULL,                     /* outputv */\n    NULL,                     /* ready_async */\n    NULL,                     /* flush */\n    NULL,                     /* call */\n    NULL                      /* event */\n};\n\ntypedef struct our_data_t {\n    PGconn* conn;\n    ErlDrvPort port;\n    int socket;\n    int connecting;\n} our_data_t;\n```\n\nSome things have changed from `pg_sync.c`: we use the entry `ready_io` for\n[`ready_input`] and [`ready_output`], which is called from the emulator only when\nthere is input to be read from the socket. (Actually, the socket is used in a\n`select` function inside the emulator, and when the socket is signaled,\nindicating there is data to read, the [`ready_input`] entry is called. More about\nthis below.)\n\nOur driver data is also extended, we keep track of the socket used for\ncommunication with postgres, and also the port, which is needed when we send\ndata to the port with [`driver_output`]. We have a flag `connecting` to tell\nwhether the driver is waiting for a connection or waiting for the result of a\nquery. (This is needed, as the entry `ready_io` is called both when connecting\nand when there is a query result.)\n\n```c\nstatic int do_connect(const char *s, our_data_t* data)\n{\n    PGconn* conn = PQconnectStart(s);\n    if (PQstatus(conn) == CONNECTION_BAD) {\n        ei_x_buff x;\n        ei_x_new_with_version(&x);\n        encode_error(&x, conn);\n        PQfinish(conn);\n        conn = NULL;\n        driver_output(data->port, x.buff, x.index);\n        ei_x_free(&x);\n    }\n    PQconnectPoll(conn);\n    int socket = PQsocket(conn);\n    data->socket = socket;\n    driver_select(data->port, (ErlDrvEvent)socket, DO_READ, 1);\n    driver_select(data->port, (ErlDrvEvent)socket, DO_WRITE, 1);\n    data->conn = conn;\n    data->connecting = 1;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThe `connect` function looks a bit different too. We connect using the\nasynchronous `PQconnectStart` function. After the connection is started, we\nretrieve the socket for the connection with `PQsocket`. This socket is used with\nthe [`driver_select`] function to wait for connection. When the socket is ready\nfor input or for output, the `ready_io` function is called.\n\nNotice that we only return data (with [`driver_output`]) if there is an error\nhere, otherwise we wait for the connection to be completed, in which case our\n`ready_io` function is called.\n\n```c\nstatic int do_select(const char* s, our_data_t* data)\n{\n    data->connecting = 0;\n    PGconn* conn = data->conn;\n    /* if there's an error return it now */\n    if (PQsendQuery(conn, s) == 0) {\n        ei_x_buff x;\n        ei_x_new_with_version(&x);\n        encode_error(&x, conn);\n        driver_output(data->port, x.buff, x.index);\n        ei_x_free(&x);\n    }\n    /* else wait for ready_output to get results */\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThe `do_select` function initiates a select, and returns if there is no\nimmediate error. The result is returned when `ready_io` is called.\n\n```c\nstatic void ready_io(ErlDrvData drv_data, ErlDrvEvent event)\n{\n    PGresult* res = NULL;\n    our_data_t* data = (our_data_t*)drv_data;\n    PGconn* conn = data->conn;\n    ei_x_buff x;\n    ei_x_new_with_version(&x);\n    if (data->connecting) {\n        ConnStatusType status;\n        PQconnectPoll(conn);\n        status = PQstatus(conn);\n        if (status == CONNECTION_OK)\n            encode_ok(&x);\n        else if (status == CONNECTION_BAD)\n            encode_error(&x, conn);\n    } else {\n        PQconsumeInput(conn);\n        if (PQisBusy(conn))\n            return;\n        res = PQgetResult(conn);\n        encode_result(&x, res, conn);\n        PQclear(res);\n        for (;;) {\n            res = PQgetResult(conn);\n            if (res == NULL)\n                break;\n            PQclear(res);\n        }\n    }\n    if (x.index > 1) {\n        driver_output(data->port, x.buff, x.index);\n        if (data->connecting)\n            driver_select(data->port, (ErlDrvEvent)data->socket, DO_WRITE, 0);\n    }\n    ei_x_free(&x);\n}\n```\n\nThe `ready_io` function is called when the socket we got from postgres is ready\nfor input or output. Here we first check if we are connecting to the database.\nIn that case, we check connection status and return OK if the connection is\nsuccessful, or error if it is not. If the connection is not yet established, we\nsimply return; `ready_io` is called again.\n\nIf we have a result from a connect, indicated by having data in the `x` buffer,\nwe no longer need to select on output ([`ready_output`]), so we remove this by\ncalling [`driver_select`].\n\nIf we are not connecting, we wait for results from a `PQsendQuery`, so we get\nthe result and return it. The encoding is done with the same functions as in the\nearlier example.\n\nError handling is to be added here, for example, checking that the socket is\nstill open, but this is only a simple example.\n\nThe Erlang part of the asynchronous driver consists of the sample file\n`pg_async.erl`.\n\n```erlang\n-module(pg_async).\n\n-define(DRV_CONNECT, $C).\n-define(DRV_DISCONNECT, $D).\n-define(DRV_SELECT, $S).\n\n-export([connect/1, disconnect/1, select/2]).\n\nconnect(ConnectStr) ->\n    case erl_ddll:load_driver(\".\", \"pg_async\") of\n        ok -> ok;\n        {error, already_loaded} -> ok;\n        _ -> exit({error, could_not_load_driver})\n    end,\n    Port = open_port({spawn, ?MODULE}, [binary]),\n    port_control(Port, ?DRV_CONNECT, ConnectStr),\n    case return_port_data(Port) of\n        ok ->\n            {ok, Port};\n        Error ->\n            Error\n    end.\n\ndisconnect(Port) ->\n    port_control(Port, ?DRV_DISCONNECT, \"\"),\n    R = return_port_data(Port),\n    port_close(Port),\n    R.\n\nselect(Port, Query) ->\n    port_control(Port, ?DRV_SELECT, Query),\n    return_port_data(Port).\n\nreturn_port_data(Port) ->\n    receive\n        {Port, {data, Data}} ->\n            binary_to_term(Data)\n    end.\n```\n\nThe Erlang code is slightly different, as we do not return the result\nsynchronously from `port_control/3`, instead we get it from [`driver_output`] as\ndata in the message queue. The function `return_port_data` above receives data\nfrom the port. As the data is in binary format, we use\n[`binary_to_term/1`](`binary_to_term/1`) to convert it to an Erlang term. Notice\nthat the driver is opened in binary mode ([`open_port/2`](`open_port/2`) is\ncalled with option `[binary]`). This means that data sent from the driver to the\nemulator is sent as binaries. Without option `binary`, they would have been\nlists of integers.","ref":"driver.html#sample-asynchronous-driver"},{"type":"extras","title":"An Asynchronous Driver Using driver_async - How to Implement a Driver","doc":"As a final example we demonstrate the use of [`driver_async`]. We also use the\ndriver term interface. The driver is written in C++. This enables us to use an\nalgorithm from STL. We use the `next_permutation` algorithm to get the next\npermutation of a list of integers. For large lists (> 100,000 elements), this\ntakes some time, so we perform this as an asynchronous task.\n\nThe asynchronous API for drivers is complicated. First, the work must be\nprepared. In the example, this is done in [`output`]. We could have used\n[`control`], but we want some variation in the examples. In our driver, we\nallocate a structure that contains anything that is needed for the asynchronous\ntask to do the work. This is done in the main emulator thread. Then the\nasynchronous function is called from a driver thread, separate from the main\nemulator thread. Notice that the driver functions are not re-entrant, so they\nare not to be used. Finally, after the function is completed, the driver\ncallback [`ready_async`] is called from the main emulator thread, this is where we\nreturn the result to Erlang. (We cannot return the result from within the\nasynchronous function, as we cannot call the driver functions.)\n\nThe following code is from the sample file `next_perm.cc`. The driver entry\nlooks like before, but also contains the callback [`ready_async`].\n\n```c\nstatic ErlDrvEntry next_perm_driver_entry = {\n    NULL,                        /* init */\n    start,\n    NULL,                        /* stop */\n    output,\n    NULL,                        /* ready_input */\n    NULL,                        /* ready_output */\n    \"next_perm\",                 /* the name of the driver */\n    NULL,                        /* finish */\n    NULL,                        /* handle */\n    NULL,                        /* control */\n    NULL,                        /* timeout */\n    NULL,                        /* outputv */\n    ready_async,\n    NULL,                        /* flush */\n    NULL,                        /* call */\n    NULL                         /* event */\n};\n```\n\nThe `output` function allocates the work area of the asynchronous function. As\nwe use C++, we use a struct, and stuff the data in it. We must copy the original\ndata, it is not valid after we have returned from the `output` function, and the\n`do_perm` function is called later, and from another thread. We return no data\nhere, instead it is sent later from the [`ready_async`] callback.\n\nThe `async_data` is passed to the `do_perm` function. We do not use a\n`async_free` function (the last argument to [`driver_async`]), it is only used if\nthe task is cancelled programmatically.\n\n```c\nstruct our_async_data {\n    bool prev;\n    vector  data;\n    our_async_data(ErlDrvPort p, int command, const char* buf, int len);\n};\n\nour_async_data::our_async_data(ErlDrvPort p, int command,\n                               const char* buf, int len)\n    : prev(command == 2),\n      data((int*)buf, (int*)buf + len / sizeof(int))\n{\n}\n\nstatic void do_perm(void* async_data);\n\nstatic void output(ErlDrvData drv_data, char *buf, int len)\n{\n    if (*buf < 1 || *buf > 2) return;\n    ErlDrvPort port = reinterpret_cast (drv_data);\n    void* async_data = new our_async_data(port, *buf, buf+1, len);\n    driver_async(port, NULL, do_perm, async_data, do_free);\n}\n```\n\nIn the `do_perm` we do the work, operating on the structure that was allocated\nin `output`.\n\n```c\nstatic void do_perm(void* async_data)\n{\n    our_async_data* d = reinterpret_cast (async_data);\n    if (d->prev)\n        prev_permutation(d->data.begin(), d->data.end());\n    else\n        next_permutation(d->data.begin(), d->data.end());\n}\n```\n\nIn the `ready_async` function the output is sent back to the emulator. We use\nthe driver term format instead of [`ei`]. This is the only way to send Erlang\nterms directly to a driver, without having the Erlang code to call\n[`binary_to_term/1`](`binary_to_term/1`). In the simple example this works well,\nand we do not need to use [`ei`] to handle the binary term format.\n\nWhen the data is returned, we deallocate our data.\n\n```c\nstatic void ready_async(ErlDrvData drv_data, ErlDrvThreadData async_data)\n{\n    ErlDrvPort port = reinterpret_cast (drv_data);\n    our_async_data* d = reinterpret_cast (async_data);\n    int n = d->data.size(), result_n = n*2 + 3;\n    ErlDrvTermData *result = new ErlDrvTermData[result_n], *rp = result;\n    for (vector ::iterator i = d->data.begin();\n         i != d->data.end(); ++i) {\n        *rp++ = ERL_DRV_INT;\n        *rp++ = *i;\n    }\n    *rp++ = ERL_DRV_NIL;\n    *rp++ = ERL_DRV_LIST;\n    *rp++ = n+1;\n    driver_output_term(port, result, result_n);\n    delete[] result;\n    delete d;\n}\n```\n\nThis driver is called like the others from Erlang. However, as we use\n[`driver_output_term`], there is no need to call `binary_to_term/1`. The Erlang code\nis in the sample file `next_perm.erl`.\n\nThe input is changed into a list of integers and sent to the driver.\n\n```erlang\n-module(next_perm).\n\n-export([next_perm/1, prev_perm/1, load/0, all_perm/1]).\n\nload() ->\n    case whereis(next_perm) of\n        undefined ->\n            case erl_ddll:load_driver(\".\", \"next_perm\") of\n                ok -> ok;\n                {error, already_loaded} -> ok;\n                E -> exit(E)\n            end,\n            Port = open_port({spawn, \"next_perm\"}, []),\n            register(next_perm, Port);\n        _ ->\n            ok\n    end.\n\nlist_to_integer_binaries(L) ->\n    [< > || I <- L].\n\nnext_perm(L) ->\n    next_perm(L, 1).\n\nprev_perm(L) ->\n    next_perm(L, 2).\n\nnext_perm(L, Nxt) ->\n    load(),\n    B = list_to_integer_binaries(L),\n    port_control(next_perm, Nxt, B),\n    receive\n        Result ->\n            Result\n    end.\n\nall_perm(L) ->\n    New = prev_perm(L),\n    all_perm(New, L, [New]).\n\nall_perm(L, L, Acc) ->\n    Acc;\nall_perm(L, Orig, Acc) ->\n    New = prev_perm(L),\n    all_perm(New, Orig, [New | Acc]).\n```\n\n[`ei`]: `e:erl_interface:ei.md`\n[`start`]: `e:erts:driver_entry.md#start`\n[`stop`]: `e:erts:driver_entry.md#stop`\n[`control`]: `e:erts:driver_entry.md#control`\n[`output`]: `e:erts:driver_entry.md#output`\n[`DRIVER_INIT`]: `e:erts:driver_entry.md#DRIVER_INIT`\n[`ready_input`]: `e:erts:driver_entry.md#ready_input`\n[`ready_output`]: `e:erts:driver_entry.md#ready_output`\n[`ready_async`]: `e:erts:driver_entry.md#ready_async`\n[`driver_output`]: `e:erts:erl_driver.md#driver_output`\n[`driver_output_term`]: `e:erts:erl_driver.md#driver_output_term`\n[`driver_select`]: `e:erts:erl_driver.md#driver_select`\n[`driver_async`]: `e:erts:erl_driver.md#driver_async`\n[`ei_x_encode_string`]: `e:erl_interface:ei.md#ei_x_encode_string`","ref":"driver.html#an-asynchronous-driver-using-driver_async"},{"type":"extras","title":"Inet Configuration","doc":"<!--\n%CopyrightBegin%\n\nCopyright Ericsson AB 2023-2024.

It also explains how you can configure it for your needs by a\nconfiguration file. The information is primarily intended for users with special\nconfiguration needs or problems. There is normally no need for specific settings\nfor Erlang to function properly on a correctly IP-configured platform.\n\nWhen Erlang starts up it reads the Kernel variable `inetrc`, which, if defined,\nis to specify the location and name of a user configuration file. Example:\n\n```text\n% erl -kernel inetrc '\"./cfg_files/erl_inetrc\"'\n```\n\nNotice that the use of an `.inetrc` file, which was supported in earlier\nErlang/OTP versions, is now obsolete.\n\nA second way to specify the configuration file is to set environment variable\n`ERL_INETRC` to the full name of the file. Example (bash):\n\n```text\n% export ERL_INETRC=./cfg_files/erl_inetrc\n```\n\nNotice that the Kernel variable `inetrc` overrides this environment variable.\n\nIf no user configuration file is specified and Erlang is started in\nnon-distributed or short name distributed mode, Erlang uses default\nconfiguration settings and a native lookup method that works correctly under\nmost circumstances. Erlang reads no information from system `inet` configuration\nfiles (such as `/etc/host.conf` and `/etc/nsswitch.conf`) in these modes, except\nfor `/etc/resolv.conf` and `/etc/hosts` that is read and monitored for changes\non Unix platforms for the internal DNS client `m:inet_res`.\n\nIf Erlang is started in long name distributed mode, it needs to get the domain\nname from somewhere and reads system `inet` configuration files for this\ninformation. Any hosts and resolver information found is also recorded, but not\nused as long as Erlang is configured for native lookups. The information becomes\nuseful if the lookup method is changed to `'file'` or `'dns'`, see below.\n\nNative lookup (system calls) is always the default resolver method. This is true\nfor all platforms, except OSE Delta where `'file'` or `'dns'` is used (in that\npriority order).\n\nOn Windows platforms, Erlang searches the system registry rather than looks for\nconfiguration files when started in long name distributed mode.","ref":"inet_cfg.html#introduction"},{"type":"extras","title":"Configuration Data - Inet Configuration","doc":"Erlang records the following data in a local database if found in system `inet`\nconfiguration files (or system registry):\n\n- Hostnames and host addresses\n- Domain name\n- Nameservers\n- Search domains\n- Lookup method\n\nThis data can also be specified explicitly in the user configuration file. This\nfile is to contain lines of configuration parameters (each terminated with a\nfull stop). Some parameters add data to the configuration (such as host and\nnameserver), others overwrite any previous settings (such as domain and lookup).\nThe user configuration file is always examined last in the configuration\nprocess, making it possible for the user to override any default values or\npreviously made settings.

Since OTP-22 it\nis possible to split large messages into smaller fragments in order to allow\nsmaller messages to be interleaved between larges messages. It is only the\n`message` part of each\n[distributed message](erl_dist_protocol.md#connected_nodes) that may be split\nusing fragmentation. Therefore it is recommended to use the\n[PAYLOAD control messages](erl_dist_protocol.md#new-ctrlmessages-for-erlang-otp-22)\nintroduced in OTP-22.\n\nFragmented distribution messages are only used if the receiving node signals\nthat it supports them via the\n[DFLAG_FRAGMENTS](erl_dist_protocol.md#DFLAG_FRAGMENTS) distribution flag.\n\nA process must complete the sending of a fragmented message before it can start\nsending any other message on the same distribution channel.\n\nThe start of a sequence of fragmented messages looks like this:\n\n| 1     | 1    | 8            | 8            | 1                       | NumberOfAtomCacheRefs/2+1 \\| 0 | N \\| 0          |\n| ----- | ---- | ------------ | ------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------- |\n| `131` | `69` | `SequenceId` | `FragmentId` | `NumberOfAtomCacheRefs` | `Flags`                        | `AtomCacheRefs` |\n\nThe continuation of a sequence of fragmented messages looks like this:\n\n| 1     | 1    | 8            | 8            |\n| ----- | ---- | ------------ | ------------ |\n| `131` | `70` | `SequenceId` | `FragmentId` |\n\nThe starting distribution header is very similar to a non-fragmented\ndistribution header. The atom cache works the same as for normal distribution\nheader and is the same for the entire sequence. The additional fields added are\nthe sequence id and fragment id.\n\n- **Sequence ID** - The sequence id is used to uniquely identify a fragmented\n  message sent from one process to another on the same distributed connection.\n  This is used to identify which sequence a fragment is a part of as the same\n  process can be in the process of receiving multiple sequences at the same\n  time.\n\n  As one process can only be sending one fragmented message at once, it can be\n  convenient to use the local PID as the sequence id.\n\n- **Fragments ID** - The Fragment ID is used to number the fragments in a\n  sequence. The id starts at the total number of fragments and then decrements\n  to 1 (which is the final fragment). So if a sequence consists of 3 fragments\n  the fragment id in the starting header will be 3, and then fragments 2 and 1\n  are sent.\n\n  The fragments must be delivered in the correct order, so if an unordered\n  distribution carrier is used, they must be ordered before delivered to the\n  Erlang run-time.\n\n#### Example:\n\nAs an example, let say that we want to send\n`{call, <0.245.2>, {set_get_state, <<0:1024>>}}` to registered process `reg`\nusing a fragment size of 128.

As\nof OTP 26, OTP nodes will therefor refuse to connect to nodes that do not\nindicate that they support the new link protocol using the\n[`DFLAG_UNLINK_ID`](erl_dist_protocol.md#DFLAG_UNLINK_ID)\n[distribution flag](erl_dist_protocol.md#dflags).\n\nThe new link protocol introduced two new signals,\n[`UNLINK_ID`](erl_dist_protocol.md#UNLINK_ID) and\n[`UNLINK_ID_ACK`](erl_dist_protocol.md#UNLINK_ID), which replaced the old\n[`UNLINK`](erl_dist_protocol.md#UNLINK) signal. The old\n[`LINK`](erl_dist_protocol.md#LINK) signal is still sent in order to set up a\nlink, but handled differently upon reception.\n\nIn order to set up a link, a `LINK` signal is sent, from the process initiating\nthe operation, to the process that it wants to link to. In order to remove a\nlink, an `UNLINK_ID` signal is sent, from the process initiating the operation,\nto the linked process. The receiver of an `UNLINK_ID` signal responds with an\n`UNLINK_ID_ACK` signal. Upon reception of an `UNLINK_ID` signal, the\ncorresponding `UNLINK_ID_ACK` signal _must_ be sent before any other signals are\nsent to the sender of the `UNLINK_ID` signal. Together with\n[the signal ordering guarantee](`e:system:ref_man_processes.md#signal-delivery`)\nof Erlang this makes it possible for the sender of the `UNLINK_ID` signal to\nknow the order of other signals which is essential for the protocol. The\n`UNLINK_ID_ACK` signal should contain the same `Id` as the `Id` contained in the\n`UNLINK_ID` signal being acknowledged.\n\nProcesses also need to maintain process local information about links. The state\nof this process local information is changed when the signals above are sent and\nreceived. This process local information also determines if a signal should be\nsent when a process calls [`link/1`](`erlang:link/1`) or\n[`unlink/1`](`erlang:unlink/1`). A `LINK` signal is only sent if there does not\ncurrently exist an active link between the processes according to the process\nlocal information and an `UNLINK_ID` signal is only sent if there currently\nexists an active link between the processes according to the process local\ninformation.\n\nThe process local information about a link contains:\n\n- **Pid** - Process identifier of the linked process.\n\n- **Active Flag** - If set, the link is active and the process will react on\n  [incoming exit signals](`e:system:ref_man_processes.md#receiving_exit_signals`)\n  issued due to the link. If not set, the link is inactive and incoming exit\n  signals, issued due to the link, will be ignored. That is, the processes are\n  considered as _not_ linked.\n\n- **Unlink Id** - Identifier of an outstanding unlink operation. That is, an\n  unlink operation that has not yet been acknowledged. This information is only\n  used when the active flag is not set.\n\nA process is only considered linked to another process if it has process local\ninformation about the link containing the process identifier of the other\nprocess and with the active flag set.\n\nThe process local information about a link is updated as follows:\n\n- **A `LINK` signal is sent** - Link information is created if not already\n  existing. The active flag is set, and unlink id is cleared. That is, if we had\n  an outstanding unlink operation we will ignore the result of that operation\n  and enable the link.\n\n- **A `LINK` signal is received** - If no link information already exists, it is\n  created, the active flag is set and unlink id is cleared. If the link\n  information already exists, the signal is silently ignored, regardless of\n  whether the active flag is set or not. That is, if we have an outstanding\n  unlink operation we will _not_ activate the link. In this scenario, the sender\n  of the `LINK` signal has not yet sent an `UNLINK_ID_ACK` signal corresponding\n  to our `UNLINK_ID` signal which means that it will receive our `UNLINK_ID`\n  signal after it sent its `LINK` signal. This in turn means that both processes\n  in the end will agree that there is no link between them.\n\n- **An `UNLINK_ID` signal is sent** - Link information already exists and the\n  active flag is set (otherwise the signal would not be sent). The active flag\n  is unset, and the unlink id of the signal is saved in the link information.\n\n- **An `UNLINK_ID` signal is received** - If the active flag is set, information\n  about the link is removed. If the active flag is not set (that is, we have an\n  outstanding unlink operation), the information about the link is left\n  unchanged.\n\n- **An `UNLINK_ID_ACK` signal is sent** - This is done when an `UNLINK_ID`\n  signal is received and causes no further changes of the link information.\n\n- **An `UNLINK_ID_ACK` signal is received** - If information about the link\n  exists, the active flag is not set, and the unlink id in the link information\n  equals the `Id` in the signal, the link information is removed; otherwise, the\n  signal is ignored.\n\nWhen a process receives an exit signal due to a link, the process will first\nreact to the exit signal if the link is active and then remove the process local\ninformation about the link.\n\nIn case the connection is lost between two nodes, exit signals with exit reason\n`noconnection` are sent to all processes with links over the connection.

When an Erlang node starts, the node has a name and it obtains an\naddress from the host OS kernel. The name and address are sent to the `epmd`\ndaemon running on the local host. In a TCP/IP environment, the address consists\nof the IP address and a port number. The node name is an atom on the form of\n`Name@Node`. The job of the `epmd` daemon is to keep track of which node name\nlistens on which address. Hence, `epmd` maps symbolic node names to machine\naddresses.\n\nThe TCP/IP `epmd` daemon only keeps track of the `Name` (first) part of an\nErlang node name. The `Host` part (whatever is after the `@`) is implicit in the\nnode name where the `epmd` daemon was contacted, as is the IP address where the\nErlang node can be reached. Consistent and correct TCP naming services are\ntherefore required for an Erlang network to function correctly.\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> On Windows the maximum number of nodes allowed in one epmd instance is 60.\n> This is because of limitations in the current implementation. If you need more\n> nodes, you should look into using and erlang based epmd implementation such as\n> [Erlang EPMD](https://github.com/erlang/epmd).\n\n- **Starting the port mapper daemon** - The daemon is started automatically by\n  command [`erl(1)`](erl_cmd.md) if the node is to be distributed and no running\n  instance is present. If automatically launched environment variables must be\n  used to change the behavior of the daemon; see section\n  [Environment Variables](epmd_cmd.md#environment_variables).\n\n  If argument `-daemon` is not specified, `epmd` runs as a normal program with\n  the controlling terminal of the shell in which it is started. Normally, it is\n  to be run as a daemon.\n\n  Regular startup options are described in section\n  [Regular Options](epmd_cmd.md#daemon_flags).\n\n  The `DbgExtra` options are described in section\n  [DbgExtra Options](epmd_cmd.md#debug_flags).\n\n- **Communicating with a running port mapper daemon** - Communicating with the\n  running `epmd` daemon by the `epmd` program is done primarily for debugging\n  purposes.\n\n  The different queries are described in section\n  [Interactive options](epmd_cmd.md#interactive_flags).\n\n[](){: #daemon_flags }","ref":"epmd_cmd.html#description"},{"type":"extras","title":"Regular Options - epmd","doc":"These options are available when starting the name server.

Notice that the\n  value passed is only a suggestion, and it can even be ignored on some\n  platforms.\n\n- **`+A size`{: #async_thread_pool_size }** - Sets the number of threads in\n  async thread pool. Valid range is 1-1024. The async thread pool is used by\n  linked-in drivers to handle work that may take a very long time.\n  Since OTP 21, the default Erlang/OTP distribution includes few\n  linked-in drivers that use the async thread pool. Most of them have\n  been migrated to dirty IO schedulers. Defaults to 1.\n\n- **`+B [c | d | i]`** - Option `c` makes `Ctrl-C` interrupt the current shell\n  instead of invoking the emulator break handler. Option `d` (same as specifying\n  `+B` without an extra option) disables the break handler. Option `i` makes the\n  emulator ignore any break signal.\n\n  If option `c` is used with `oldshell` on Unix, `Ctrl-C` will restart the shell\n  process rather than interrupt it.\n\n- **`+c true | false`{: #+c }** - Enables or disables\n  [time correction](time_correction.md#time-correction):\n\n  - **`true`** - Enables time correction. This is the default if time correction\n    is supported on the specific platform.\n\n  - **`false`** - Disables time correction.\n\n  For backward compatibility, the boolean value can be omitted. This is\n  interpreted as `+c false`.\n\n- **`+C no_time_warp | single_time_warp | multi_time_warp`{: #+C_ }** - Sets\n  [time warp mode](time_correction.md#time-warp-modes):\n\n  - **`no_time_warp`** -\n    [No time warp mode](time_correction.md#no-time-warp-mode)\n\n  - **`single_time_warp`** -\n    [Single time warp mode](time_correction.md#single-time-warp-mode)\n\n  - **`multi_time_warp`** -\n    [Multi-time warp mode](time_correction.md#multi-time-warp-mode) (the default since Erlang/OTP 26.0)\n\n- **`+d`** - If the emulator detects an internal error (or runs out of memory),\n  it, by default, generates both a crash dump and a core dump. The core dump is,\n  however, not very useful as the content of process heaps is destroyed by the\n  crash dump generation.\n\n  Option `+d` instructs the emulator to produce only a core dump and no crash\n  dump if an internal error is detected.\n\n  Calling `erlang:halt/1` with a string argument still produces a crash dump. On\n  Unix systems, sending an emulator process a `SIGUSR1` signal also forces a\n  crash dump.\n\n- **`+dcg DecentralizedCounterGroupsLimit`{: #+dcg }** - Limits the number of\n  decentralized counter groups used by decentralized counters optimized for\n  update operations in the Erlang runtime system. By default, the limit is 256.\n\n  When the number of schedulers is less than or equal to the limit, each\n  scheduler has its own group. When the number of schedulers is larger than the\n  groups limit, schedulers share groups. Shared groups degrade the performance\n  for updating counters while many reader groups degrade the performance for\n  reading counters. So, the limit is a tradeoff between performance for update\n  operations and performance for read operations. Each group consumes 64 bytes\n  in each counter.\n\n  Note that a runtime system using decentralized counter groups benefits from\n  [binding schedulers to logical processors](#%2Bsbt), as the groups\n  are distributed better between schedulers with this option.\n\n  This option only affects decentralized counters used for the counters that are\n  keeping track of the memory consumption and the number of terms in ETS tables\n  of type ordered_set with the write_concurrency option activated.\n\n- **`+e Number`{: #+e }** - Sets the maximum number of ETS tables. This limit is\n  [partially obsolete](`m:ets#max_ets_tables`).\n\n- **`+ec`** - Forces option `compressed` on all ETS tables. Only intended for\n  test and evaluation.\n\n- **`+fnl`{: #file_name_encoding }** - The virtual machine works with filenames\n  as if they are encoded using the ISO Latin-1 encoding, disallowing Unicode\n  characters with code points > 255.\n\n  For more information about Unicode filenames, see section\n  [Unicode Filenames](`e:stdlib:unicode_usage.md#unicode_file_names`) in the\n  STDLIB User's Guide. Notice that this value also applies to command-line\n  parameters and environment variables (see section\n  [Unicode in Environment and Parameters](`e:stdlib:unicode_usage.md#unicode_in_environment_and_parameters`)\n  in the STDLIB User's Guide).\n\n- **`+fnu[{w|i|e}]`** - The virtual machine works with filenames as if they are\n  encoded using UTF-8 (or some other system-specific Unicode encoding). This is\n  the default on operating systems that enforce Unicode encoding, that is,\n  Windows MacOS X and Android.\n\n  The `+fnu` switch can be followed by `w`, `i`, or `e` to control how wrongly\n  encoded filenames are to be reported:\n\n  - `w` means that a warning is sent to the `error_logger` whenever a wrongly\n    encoded filename is \"skipped\" in directory listings. This is the default.\n  - `i` means that those wrongly encoded filenames are silently ignored.\n  - `e` means that the API function returns an error whenever a wrongly encoded\n    filename (or directory name) is encountered.\n\n  Notice that `file:read_link/1` always returns an error if the link points to\n  an invalid filename.\n\n  For more information about Unicode filenames, see section\n  [Unicode Filenames](`e:stdlib:unicode_usage.md#unicode_file_names`) in the\n  STDLIB User's Guide. Notice that this value also applies to command-line\n  parameters and environment variables (see section\n  [Unicode in Environment and Parameters](`e:stdlib:unicode_usage.md#unicode_in_environment_and_parameters`)\n  in the STDLIB User's Guide).\n\n- **`+fna[{w|i|e}]`** - Selection between `+fnl` and `+fnu` is done based on the\n  current locale settings in the OS. This means that if you have set your\n  terminal for UTF-8 encoding, the filesystem is expected to use the same\n  encoding for filenames. This is the default on all operating systems, except\n  Android, MacOS X and Windows.\n\n  The `+fna` switch can be followed by `w`, `i`, or `e`. This has effect if the\n  locale settings cause the behavior of `+fnu` to be selected; see the\n  description of `+fnu` above. If the locale settings cause the behavior of\n  `+fnl` to be selected, then `w`, `i`, or `e` have no effect.\n\n  For more information about Unicode filenames, see section\n  [Unicode Filenames](`e:stdlib:unicode_usage.md#unicode_file_names`) in the\n  STDLIB User's Guide. Notice that this value also applies to command-line\n  parameters and environment variables (see section\n  [Unicode in Environment and Parameters](`e:stdlib:unicode_usage.md#unicode_in_environment_and_parameters`)\n  in the STDLIB User's Guide).\n\n- **`+hms Size`** - Sets the default heap size of processes to the size `Size`\n  words.\n\n- **`+hmbs Size`** - Sets the default binary virtual heap size of processes to\n  the size `Size` words.\n\n- **`+hmax Size`{: #+hmax }** - Sets the default maximum heap size of processes\n  to the size `Size` words. Defaults to `0`, which means that no maximum heap\n  size is used. For more information, see\n  [`process_flag(max_heap_size, MaxHeapSize)`](`m:erlang#process_flag_max_heap_size`).\n\n- **`+hmaxel true|false`{: #+hmaxel }** - Sets whether to send an error logger\n  message or not for processes reaching the maximum heap size. Defaults to\n  `true`. For more information, see\n  [`process_flag(max_heap_size, MaxHeapSize)`](`m:erlang#process_flag_max_heap_size`).\n\n- **`+hmaxib true|false`{: #+hmaxib }** - Sets whether to include the size of\n  shared off-heap binaries in the sum compared against the maximum heap size.\n  Defaults to `false`. For more information, see\n  [`process_flag(max_heap_size, MaxHeapSize)`](`m:erlang#process_flag_max_heap_size`).\n\n- **`+hmaxk true|false`{: #+hmaxk }** - Sets whether to kill processes reaching\n  the maximum heap size or not. Default to `true`. For more information, see\n  [`process_flag(max_heap_size, MaxHeapSize)`](`m:erlang#process_flag_max_heap_size`).\n\n- **`+hpds Size`** - Sets the initial process dictionary size of processes to\n  the size `Size`.\n\n- **`+hmqd off_heap|on_heap`{: #+hmqd }** - Sets the default value of the\n  `message_queue_data` process flag. Defaults to `on_heap`. If `+hmqd` is not\n  passed, `on_heap` will be the default. For more information, see\n  [`process_flag(message_queue_data, MQD)`](`m:erlang#process_flag_message_queue_data`).\n\n- **`+IOp PollSets`{: #+IOp }** - Sets the number of IO pollsets to use when\n  polling for I/O. This option is only used on platforms that support concurrent\n  updates of a pollset, otherwise the same number of pollsets are used as IO\n  poll threads. The default is 1.\n\n- **`+IOt PollThreads`{: #+IOt }** - Sets the number of IO poll threads to use\n  when polling for I/O. The maximum number of poll threads allowed is 1024. The\n  default is 1.\n\n  A good way to check if more IO poll threads are needed is to use\n  [microstate accounting](`m:msacc`) and see what the load of the IO poll thread\n  is. If it is high it could be a good idea to add more threads.\n\n- **`+IOPp PollSetsPercentage`{: #+IOPp }** - Similar to\n  [`+IOp`](#%2BIOp) but uses percentages to set the number of IO\n  pollsets to create, based on the number of poll threads configured. If both\n  `+IOPp` and `+IOp` are used, `+IOPp` is ignored.\n\n- **`+IOPt PollThreadsPercentage`{: #+IOPt }** - Similar to\n  [`+IOt`](#%2BIOt) but uses percentages to set the number of IO poll\n  threads to create, based on the number of schedulers configured. If both\n  `+IOPt` and `+IOt` are used, `+IOPt` is ignored.\n\n- **`+IOs true|false`{: #+IOs }** - Enable or disable scheduler thread poll\n  optimization. Default is `true`.\n\n  If enabled, file descriptors that are frequently read may be moved to a\n  special pollset used by scheduler threads. The objective is to reduce the\n  number of system calls and thereby CPU load, but it can in some cases increase\n  scheduling latency for individual file descriptor input events.\n\n- **`+JPcover true|false|function|function_counters|line|line_counters`{:\n  #+JPcover }** - Since: OTP 27.0\n\n  Enables or disables support for coverage when running with the JIT. Defaults\n  to false.\n\n  - **`function`** - All modules that are loaded will be instrumented to keep\n    track of which functions are executed. Information about which functions\n    that have been executed can be retrieved by calling\n    [`code:get_coverage(function, Module)`](`code:get_coverage/2`).\n\n  - **`function_counters`** - All modules that are loaded will be instrumented\n    to count how many times each function is executed. Information about how\n    many times each function has been executed can be retrieved by calling\n    [`code:get_coverage(function, Module)`](`code:get_coverage/2`).\n\n  - **`line`** - When modules that have been compiled with the\n    [`line_coverage`](`m:compile#line_coverage`) option are loaded, they will be\n    instrumented to keep track of which lines have been executed. Information\n    about which lines have been executed can be retrieved by calling\n    [`code:get_coverage(line, Module)`](`code:get_coverage/2`), and information\n    about which functions that have been executed can be retrieved by calling\n    [`code:get_coverage(function, Module)`](`code:get_coverage/2`).\n\n  - **`line_counters`** - When modules that have been compiled with the\n    [`line_coverage`](`m:compile#line_coverage`) option are loaded, they will be\n    instrumented to count the number of times each line is executed. Information\n    about how many times each line has been executed can be retrieved by calling\n    [`code:get_coverage(line, Module)`](`code:get_coverage/2`), and information\n    about which functions that have been executed can be retrieved by calling\n    [`code:get_coverage(function, Module)`](`code:get_coverage/2`) (note that in\n    this mode, counters for the number of times each function has been executed\n    **cannot** be retrieved).\n\n  - **`true`** - Same as `line_counters`.\n\n  - **`false`** - Disables coverage.\n\n- **`+JPperf true|false|dump|map|fp|no_fp`{: #+JPperf }** - Enables or disables\n  support for the `perf` profiler when running with the JIT on Linux. Defaults\n  to false.\n\n  This option can be combined multiple times to enable several options:\n\n  - **`dump`** - Gives `perf` detailed line information, so that the\n    `perf annotate` feature works.\n\n  - **`map`** - Gives `perf` a map over all module code, letting it translate\n    machine code addresses to Erlang source code locations. This also enables\n    frame pointers for Erlang code so that `perf` can walk the call stacks of\n    Erlang processes, which costs one extra word per stack frame.\n\n  - **`fp`** - Enables frame pointers independently of the `map` option.\n\n  - **`no_fp`** - Disables the frame pointers added by the `map` option.\n\n  - **`true`** - Enables `map` and `dump`.\n\n  - **`false`** - Disables all other options.\n\n  For more details about how to run perf see the\n  [perf support](BeamAsm.md#linux-perf-support) section in the BeamAsm internal\n  documentation.\n\n- **`+JMsingle true|false`{: #+JMsingle }** - Since: OTP-26.0\n\n  Enables or disables the use of single-mapped RWX memory for JIT code. The\n  default is to map JIT:ed machine code into two regions sharing the same\n  physical pages, where one region is executable but not writable, and the other\n  writable but not executable. As some tools, such as QEMU user mode emulation,\n  cannot deal with the dual mapping, this flags allows it to be disabled. This\n  flag is automatically enabled by the [`+JPperf`](#%2BJPperf) flag.\n\n- **`+L`** - Prevents loading information about source filenames and line\n  numbers. This saves some memory, but exceptions do not contain information\n  about the filenames and line numbers.\n\n- **`+MFlag Value`{: #erts_alloc }** - Memory allocator-specific flags. For more\n  information, see [`erts_alloc(3)`](erts_alloc.md).\n\n- **`+pad true|false`{: #+pad }** - Since: OTP 25.3\n\n  The boolean value used with the `+pad` parameter determines the default value\n  of the [`async_dist`](`m:erlang#process_flag_async_dist`) process flag of\n  newly spawned processes. By default, if no `+pad` command line option is\n  passed, the `async_dist` flag will be set to `false`.\n\n  The value used in runtime can be inspected by calling\n  [`erlang:system_info(async_dist)`](`m:erlang#system_info_async_dist`).\n\n- **[](){: #%2Bpc } `+pc Range`{: #printable_character_range }** -\n  Sets the range of characters that the system considers printable in heuristic\n  detection of strings. This typically affects the shell, debugger, and\n  `io:format` functions (when `~tp` is used in the format string).\n\n  Two values are supported for `Range`:\n\n  - **`latin1`** - The default. Only characters in the ISO Latin-1 range can be\n    considered printable. This means that a character with a code point > 255 is\n    never considered printable and that lists containing such characters are\n    displayed as lists of integers rather than text strings by tools.\n\n  - **`unicode`** - All printable Unicode characters are considered when\n    determining if a list of integers is to be displayed in string syntax. This\n    can give unexpected results if, for example, your font does not cover all\n    Unicode characters.\n\n  See also `io:printable_range/0` in STDLIB.\n\n- **[](){: #%2BP } `+P Number`{: #max_processes }** -\n  Sets the maximum number of simultaneously existing processes for this system\n  if a `Number` is passed as value. Valid range for `Number` is\n  `[1024-134217727]`.\n\n  > #### Note {: .info }\n  >\n  > The actual maximum chosen may be much larger than the `Number`\n  > passed. Currently the runtime system often, but not always,\n  > chooses a value that is a power of 2. This might, however, be\n  > changed in the future. The actual value chosen can be checked by\n  > calling\n  > [erlang:system_info(process_limit)](`m:erlang#system_info_process_limit`).\n\n  The default value is `1048576`\n\n- **[](){: #%2BQ } `+Q Number`{: #max_ports }** -\n  Sets the maximum number of simultaneously existing ports for this system if a\n  Number is passed as value. Valid range for `Number` is `[1024-134217727]`.\n\n  > #### Note {: .info }\n  >\n  > The actual maximum chosen may be much larger than the actual\n  > `Number` passed. Currently the runtime system often, but not\n  > always, chooses a value that is a power of 2. This might, however,\n  > be changed in the future. The actual value chosen can be checked\n  > by calling\n  > [`erlang:system_info(port_limit)`](`m:erlang#system_info_port_limit`).\n\n  The default value used is normally `65536`. However, if the runtime system is\n  able to determine maximum amount of file descriptors that it is allowed to\n  open and this value is larger than `65536`, the chosen value will increased to\n  a value larger or equal to the maximum amount of file descriptors that can be\n  opened.\n\n  On Windows the default value is set to `8196` because the normal OS\n  limitations are set higher than most machines can handle.\n\n- **`+R ReleaseNumber`{: #compat_rel }** - Sets the compatibility mode.\n\n  The distribution mechanism is not backward compatible by default. This flag\n  sets the emulator in compatibility mode with an earlier Erlang/OTP release\n  `ReleaseNumber`. The release number must be in the range\n  ` -2` through ` `. This limits the emulator,\n  making it possible for it to communicate with Erlang nodes (as well as C\n  and Java nodes) running that earlier release.\n\n  > #### Note {: .info }\n  >\n  > Ensure that all nodes (Erlang-, C-, and Java nodes) of a distributed Erlang\n  > system is of the same Erlang/OTP release, or from two different Erlang/OTP\n  > releases X and Y, where _all_ Y nodes have compatibility mode X.\n\n- **`+r`** - Forces ETS memory blocks to be moved on reallocation.\n\n- **`+rg ReaderGroupsLimit`{: #+rg }** - Limits the number of reader groups used\n  by read/write locks optimized for read operations in the Erlang runtime\n  system. By default the reader groups limit is 64.\n\n  When the number of schedulers is less than or equal to the reader groups\n  limit, each scheduler has its own reader group. When the number of schedulers\n  is larger than the reader groups limit, schedulers share reader groups. Shared\n  reader groups degrade read lock and read unlock performance while many reader\n  groups degrade write lock performance. So, the limit is a tradeoff between\n  performance for read operations and performance for write operations. Each\n  reader group consumes 64 byte in each read/write lock.\n\n  Notice that a runtime system using shared reader groups benefits from\n  [binding schedulers to logical processors](#%2Bsbt), as the reader\n  groups are distributed better between schedulers.\n\n- **`+S Schedulers:SchedulerOnline`{: #+S }** - Sets the number of scheduler\n  threads to create and scheduler threads to set online. The maximum for both\n  values is 1024. If the Erlang runtime system is able to determine the number\n  of logical processors configured and logical processors available,\n  `Schedulers` defaults to logical processors configured, and `SchedulersOnline`\n  defaults to logical processors available; otherwise the default values are 1.\n  If the emulator detects that it is subject to a\n  [CPU quota](`m:erlang#system_info_cpu_quota`), the default value for\n  `SchedulersOnline` will be limited accordingly.\n\n  `Schedulers` can be omitted if `:SchedulerOnline` is not and conversely. The\n  number of schedulers online can be changed at runtime through\n  [`erlang:system_flag(schedulers_online, SchedulersOnline)`](`m:erlang#system_flag_schedulers_online`).\n\n  If `Schedulers` or `SchedulersOnline` is specified as a negative number, the\n  value is subtracted from the default number of logical processors configured\n  or logical processors available, respectively.\n\n  Specifying value `0` for `Schedulers` or `SchedulersOnline` resets the number\n  of scheduler threads or scheduler threads online, respectively, to its default\n  value.\n\n- **`+SP SchedulersPercentage:SchedulersOnlinePercentage`{: #+SP }** - Similar\n  to [`+S`](#%2BS) but uses percentages to set the number of scheduler\n  threads to create, based on logical processors configured, and scheduler\n  threads to set online, based on logical processors available. Specified values\n  must be > 0. For example, `+SP 50:25` sets the number of scheduler threads to\n  50% of the logical processors configured, and the number of scheduler threads\n  online to 25% of the logical processors available. `SchedulersPercentage` can\n  be omitted if `:SchedulersOnlinePercentage` is not and conversely. The number\n  of schedulers online can be changed at runtime through\n  [`erlang:system_flag(schedulers_online, SchedulersOnline)`](`m:erlang#system_flag_schedulers_online`).\n\n  This option interacts with [`+S`](#%2BS) settings. For example, on a\n  system with 8 logical cores configured and 8 logical cores available, the\n  combination of the options `+S 4:4 +SP 50:25` (in either order) results in 2\n  scheduler threads (50% of 4) and 1 scheduler thread online (25% of 4).\n\n- **`+SDcpu DirtyCPUSchedulers:DirtyCPUSchedulersOnline`{: #+SDcpu }** - Sets\n  the number of dirty CPU scheduler threads to create and dirty CPU scheduler\n  threads to set online. The maximum for both values is 1024, and each value is\n  further limited by the settings for normal schedulers:\n\n  - The number of dirty CPU scheduler threads created cannot exceed the number\n    of normal scheduler threads created.\n  - The number of dirty CPU scheduler threads online cannot exceed the number of\n    normal scheduler threads online.\n\n  For details, see [`+S`](#%2BS) and [`+SP`](#%2BSP). By\n  default, the number of dirty CPU scheduler threads created equals the number\n  of normal scheduler threads created, and the number of dirty CPU scheduler\n  threads online equals the number of normal scheduler threads online.\n  `DirtyCPUSchedulers` can be omitted if `:DirtyCPUSchedulersOnline` is not and\n  conversely. The number of dirty CPU schedulers online can be changed at\n  runtime through\n  [`erlang:system_flag(dirty_cpu_schedulers_online, DirtyCPUSchedulersOnline)`](`m:erlang#system_flag_dirty_cpu_schedulers_online`).\n\n  The amount of dirty CPU schedulers is limited by the amount of normal\n  schedulers in order to limit the effect on processes executing on ordinary\n  schedulers. If the amount of dirty CPU schedulers was allowed to be unlimited,\n  dirty CPU bound jobs would potentially starve normal jobs.\n\n  Typical users of the dirty CPU schedulers are large garbage collections, json\n  protocol encode/decoders written as nifs and matrix manipulation libraries.\n\n  You can use `m:msacc` in order to see the current load of the dirty CPU\n  schedulers threads and adjust the number used accordingly.\n\n- **`+SDPcpu DirtyCPUSchedulersPercentage:DirtyCPUSchedulersOnlinePercentage`{:\n  #+SDPcpu }** - Similar to [`+SDcpu`](#%2BSDcpu) but uses percentages\n  to set the number of dirty CPU scheduler threads to create and the number of\n  dirty CPU scheduler threads to set online. Specified values must be > 0. For\n  example, `+SDPcpu 50:25` sets the number of dirty CPU scheduler threads to 50%\n  of the logical processors configured and the number of dirty CPU scheduler\n  threads online to 25% of the logical processors available.\n  `DirtyCPUSchedulersPercentage` can be omitted if\n  `:DirtyCPUSchedulersOnlinePercentage` is not and conversely. The number of\n  dirty CPU schedulers online can be changed at runtime through\n  [`erlang:system_flag(dirty_cpu_schedulers_online, DirtyCPUSchedulersOnline)`](`m:erlang#system_flag_dirty_cpu_schedulers_online`).\n\n  This option interacts with [`+SDcpu`](#%2BSDcpu) settings. For\n  example, on a system with 8 logical cores configured and 8 logical cores\n  available, the combination of the options `+SDcpu 4:4 +SDPcpu 50:25` (in\n  either order) results in 2 dirty CPU scheduler threads (50% of 4) and 1 dirty\n  CPU scheduler thread online (25% of 4).\n\n- **`+SDio DirtyIOSchedulers`{: #+SDio }** - Sets the number of dirty I/O\n  scheduler threads to create. Valid range is 1-1024. By default, the number of\n  dirty I/O scheduler threads created is 10.\n\n  The amount of dirty IO schedulers is not limited by the amount of normal\n  schedulers [like the amount of dirty CPU schedulers](#%2BSDcpu).\n  This since only I/O bound work is expected to execute on dirty I/O schedulers.\n  If the user should schedule CPU bound jobs on dirty I/O schedulers, these jobs\n  might starve ordinary jobs executing on ordinary schedulers.\n\n  Typical users of the dirty IO schedulers are reading and writing to files.\n\n  You can use `m:msacc` in order to see the current load of the dirty IO\n  schedulers threads and adjust the number used accordingly.\n\n- **`+sFlag Value`** - Scheduling specific flags.\n\n  - **`+sbt BindType`{: #+sbt }** - Sets scheduler bind type.\n\n    Schedulers can also be bound using flag [`+stbt`](#%2Bstbt). The\n    only difference between these two flags is how the following errors are\n    handled:\n\n    - Binding of schedulers is not supported on the specific platform.\n    - No available CPU topology. That is, the runtime system was not able to\n      detect the CPU topology automatically, and no\n      [user-defined CPU topology](#%2Bsct) was set.\n\n    If any of these errors occur when `+sbt` has been passed, the runtime system\n    prints an error message, and refuses to start. If any of these errors occur\n    when `+stbt` has been passed, the runtime system silently ignores the error,\n    and start up using unbound schedulers.\n\n    Valid `BindType`s:\n\n    - **`u`** - `unbound` \\- Schedulers are not bound to logical processors,\n      that is, the operating system decides where the scheduler threads execute,\n      and when to migrate them. This is the default.\n\n    - **`ns`** - `no_spread` \\- Schedulers with close scheduler identifiers are\n      bound as close as possible in hardware.\n\n    - **`ts`** - `thread_spread` \\- Thread refers to hardware threads (such as\n      Intel's hyper-threads). Schedulers with low scheduler identifiers, are\n      bound to the first hardware thread of each core, then schedulers with\n      higher scheduler identifiers are bound to the second hardware thread of\n      each core,and so on.\n\n    - **`ps`** - `processor_spread` \\- Schedulers are spread like\n      `thread_spread`, but also over physical processor chips.\n\n    - **`s`** - `spread` \\- Schedulers are spread as much as possible.\n\n    - **`nnts`** - `no_node_thread_spread` \\- Like `thread_spread`, but if\n      multiple Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) nodes exist, schedulers are\n      spread over one NUMA node at a time, that is, all logical processors of\n      one NUMA node are bound to schedulers in sequence.\n\n    - **`nnps`** - `no_node_processor_spread` \\- Like `processor_spread`, but if\n      multiple NUMA nodes exist, schedulers are spread over one NUMA node at a\n      time, that is, all logical processors of one NUMA node are bound to\n      schedulers in sequence.\n\n    - **`tnnps`** - `thread_no_node_processor_spread` \\- A combination of\n      `thread_spread`, and `no_node_processor_spread`. Schedulers are spread\n      over hardware threads across NUMA nodes, but schedulers are only spread\n      over processors internally in one NUMA node at a time.\n\n    - **`db`** - `default_bind` \\- Binds schedulers the default way. Defaults to\n      `thread_no_node_processor_spread` (which can change in the future).\n\n    Binding of schedulers is only supported on newer Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD,\n    and Windows systems.\n\n    If no CPU topology is available when flag `+sbt` is processed and `BindType`\n    is any other type than `u`, the runtime system fails to start. CPU topology\n    can be defined using flag [`+sct`](#%2Bsct). Notice that flag\n    `+sct` can have to be passed before flag `+sbt` on the command line (if no\n    CPU topology has been automatically detected).\n\n    The runtime system does by default _not_ bind schedulers to logical\n    processors.\n\n    > #### Note {: .info }\n    >\n    > If the Erlang runtime system is the only operating system process that\n    > binds threads to logical processors, this improves the performance of the\n    > runtime system. However, if other operating system processes (for example\n    > another Erlang runtime system) also bind threads to logical processors,\n    > there can be a performance penalty instead. This performance penalty can\n    > sometimes be severe. If so, you are advised not to bind the schedulers.\n\n    How schedulers are bound matters. For example, in situations when there are\n    fewer running processes than schedulers online, the runtime system tries to\n    migrate processes to schedulers with low scheduler identifiers. The more the\n    schedulers are spread over the hardware, the more resources are available to\n    the runtime system in such situations.\n\n    > #### Note {: .info }\n    >\n    > If a scheduler fails to bind, this is often silently ignored, as it is not\n    > always possible to verify valid logical processor identifiers.

Defaults to `medium`. The threshold\n    determines how long schedulers are to busy wait when running out of work\n    before going to sleep.\n\n    > #### Note {: .info }\n    >\n    > This flag can be removed or changed at any time without prior notice.\n\n  - **`+sbwtdcpu none|very_short|short|medium|long|very_long`{: #+sbwtdcpu }** -\n    As [`+sbwt`](#%2Bsbwt) but affects dirty CPU schedulers.

Defaults\n    to `short`.\n\n    > #### Note {: .info }\n    >\n    > This flag can be removed or changed at any time without prior notice.\n\n  - **`+scl true|false`{: #+scl }** - Enables or disables scheduler compaction\n    of load. By default scheduler compaction of load is enabled. When enabled,\n    load balancing strives for a load distribution, which causes as many\n    scheduler threads as possible to be fully loaded (that is, not run out of\n    work). This is accomplished by migrating load (for example, runnable\n    processes) into a smaller set of schedulers when schedulers frequently run\n    out of work. When disabled, the frequency with which schedulers run out of\n    work is not taken into account by the load balancing logic.\n\n    `+scl false` is similar to [`+sub true`](#%2Bsub), but `+sub true`\n    also balances scheduler utilization between schedulers.\n\n  - **`+sct CpuTopology`{: #+sct }** - Sets a user-defined CPU topology.\n    The user-defined CPU topology overrides\n    any automatically detected CPU topology. The CPU topology is used when\n    [binding schedulers to logical processors](#%2Bsbt). This option must be before\n    [`+sbt`](#%2Bsbt) on the command-line.\n\n    ```\n      = integer(); when 0 =<   =< 65535\n      =  - \n      =   |  \n      =  ,  |  \n      = L \n      = T  | t \n      = C  | c \n      = P  | p \n      = N  | n \n      =       |\n                    \n    CpuTopology =  :  |  \n    ```\n\n    Uppercase letters signify real identifiers and lowercase letters signify\n    fake identifiers only used for description of the topology. Identifiers\n    passed as real identifiers can be used by the runtime system when trying to\n    access specific hardware; if they are incorrect the behavior is undefined.\n    Faked logical CPU identifiers are not accepted, as there is no point in\n    defining the CPU topology without real logical CPU identifiers. Thread,\n    core, processor, and node identifiers can be omitted. If omitted, the thread\n    ID defaults to `t0`, the core ID defaults to `c0`, the processor ID defaults\n    to `p0`, and the node ID is left undefined. Either each logical processor\n    must belong to only one NUMA node, or no logical processors must belong to\n    any NUMA nodes.\n\n    Both increasing and decreasing ` `s are allowed.\n\n    NUMA node identifiers are system wide. That is, each NUMA node on the system\n    must have a unique identifier. Processor identifiers are also system wide.\n    Core identifiers are processor wide. Thread identifiers are core wide.\n\n    The order of the identifier types implies the hierarchy of the CPU topology.\n    The valid orders are as follows:\n\n    - `     `, that is, thread\n      is part of a core that is part of a processor, which is part of a NUMA\n      node.\n    - `     `, that is, thread\n      is part of a core that is part of a NUMA node, which is part of a\n      processor.\n\n    A CPU topology can consist of both processor external, and processor\n    internal NUMA nodes as long as each logical processor belongs to only one\n    NUMA node. If ` ` is omitted, its default position is before\n    ` `. That is, the default is processor external NUMA nodes.\n\n    If a list of identifiers is used in an ` `:\n\n    - ` ` must be a list of identifiers.\n    - At least one other identifier type besides ` ` must also have a\n      list of identifiers.\n    - All lists of identifiers must produce the same number of identifiers.\n\n    A simple example. A single quad core processor can be described as follows:\n\n    ```erlang\n    % erl +sct L0-3c0-3\n    1> erlang:system_info(cpu_topology).\n    [{processor,[{core,{logical,0}},\n                 {core,{logical,1}},\n                 {core,{logical,2}},\n                 {core,{logical,3}}]}]\n    ```\n\n    A more complicated example with two quad core processors, each processor in\n    its own NUMA node. The ordering of logical processors is a bit weird. This\n    to give a better example of identifier lists:\n\n    ```erlang\n    % erl +sct L0-1,3-2c0-3p0N0:L7,4,6-5c0-3p1N1\n    1> erlang:system_info(cpu_topology).\n    [{node,[{processor,[{core,{logical,0}},\n                        {core,{logical,1}},\n                        {core,{logical,3}},\n                        {core,{logical,2}}]}]},\n     {node,[{processor,[{core,{logical,7}},\n                        {core,{logical,4}},\n                        {core,{logical,6}},\n                        {core,{logical,5}}]}]}]\n    ```\n\n    As long as real identifiers are correct, it is OK to pass a CPU topology\n    that is not a correct description of the CPU topology. When used with care\n    this can be very useful. This to trick the emulator to bind its schedulers\n    as you want. For example, if you want to run multiple Erlang runtime systems\n    on the same machine, you want to reduce the number of schedulers used and\n    manipulate the CPU topology so that they bind to different logical CPUs. An\n    example, with two Erlang runtime systems on a quad core machine:\n\n    ```text\n    % erl +sct L0-3c0-3 +sbt db +S3:2 -detached -noinput -noshell -sname one\n    % erl +sct L3-0c0-3 +sbt db +S3:2 -detached -noinput -noshell -sname two\n    ```\n\n    In this example, each runtime system have two schedulers each online, and\n    all schedulers online will run on different cores. If we change to one\n    scheduler online on one runtime system, and three schedulers online on the\n    other, all schedulers online will still run on different cores.\n\n    Notice that a faked CPU topology that does not reflect how the real CPU\n    topology looks like is likely to decrease the performance of the runtime\n    system.\n\n    For more information, see\n    [`erlang:system_info(cpu_topology)`](`m:erlang#system_info_cpu_topology`).\n\n  - **`+ssrct`{: #+ssrct }** - Skips reading CPU topology.\n\n    > #### Note {: .info }\n    >\n    > Reading CPU topology slows down startup when starting many parallel\n    > instances of ERTS on systems with large amount of cores; using this flag\n    > might speed up execution in such scenarios.\n\n  - **`+sfwi Interval`{: #+sfwi }** - Sets scheduler-forced wakeup interval. All\n    run queues are scanned each `Interval` milliseconds. While there are\n    sleeping schedulers in the system, one scheduler is woken for each non-empty\n    run queue found. `Interval` default to `0`, meaning this feature is\n    disabled.\n\n    > #### Note {: .info }\n    >\n    > This feature has been introduced as a temporary workaround for\n    > long-executing native code, and native code that does not bump reductions\n    > properly in OTP.

If set to `true`, the virtual machine schedules port tasks when\n    it improves parallelism in the system. If set to `false`, the virtual\n    machine tries to perform port tasks immediately, improving latency at the\n    expense of parallelism. Default to `false`. The default used can be\n    inspected in runtime by calling\n    [`erlang:system_info(port_parallelism)`](`m:erlang#system_info_port_parallelism`).\n    The default can be overridden on port creation by passing option\n    [`parallelism`](`m:erlang#open_port_parallelism`) to `erlang:open_port/2`.\n\n  - **`+sss size`{: #sched_thread_stack_size }** - Suggested stack size, in\n    kilowords, for scheduler threads. Valid range is 20-8192 kilowords. The\n    default suggested stack size is 128 kilowords.\n\n  - **`+sssdcpu size`{: #dcpu_sched_thread_stack_size }** - Suggested stack\n    size, in kilowords, for dirty CPU scheduler threads. Valid range is 20-8192\n    kilowords. The default suggested stack size is 40 kilowords.\n\n  - **`+sssdio size`{: #dio_sched_thread_stack_size }** - Suggested stack size,\n    in kilowords, for dirty IO scheduler threads. Valid range is 20-8192\n    kilowords. The default suggested stack size is 40 kilowords.\n\n  - **`+stbt BindType`{: #+stbt }** - Tries to set the scheduler bind type. The\n    same as flag [`+sbt`](#%2Bsbt) except how some errors are handled.\n    For more information, see [`+sbt`](#%2Bsbt).\n\n  - **`+sub true|false`{: #+sub }** - Enables or disables\n    [scheduler utilization](`m:erlang#statistics_scheduler_wall_time`) balancing\n    of load. By default scheduler utilization balancing is disabled and instead\n    scheduler compaction of load is enabled, which strives for a load\n    distribution that causes as many scheduler threads as possible to be fully\n    loaded (that is, not run out of work). When scheduler utilization balancing\n    is enabled, the system instead tries to balance scheduler utilization\n    between schedulers. That is, strive for equal scheduler utilization on all\n    schedulers.\n\n    `+sub true` is only supported on systems where the runtime system detects\n    and uses a monotonically increasing high-resolution clock. On other systems,\n    the runtime system fails to start.\n\n    `+sub true` implies [`+scl false`](#%2Bscl). The difference\n    between `+sub true` and `+scl false` is that `+scl false` does not try to\n    balance the scheduler utilization.\n\n  - **`+swct very_eager|eager|medium|lazy|very_lazy`{: #+swct }** - Sets\n    scheduler wake cleanup threshold. Defaults to `medium`. Controls how eager\n    schedulers are to be requesting wakeup because of certain cleanup\n    operations. When a lazy setting is used, more outstanding cleanup operations\n    can be left undone while a scheduler is idling. When an eager setting is\n    used, schedulers are more frequently woken, potentially increasing\n    CPU-utilization.\n\n    > #### Note {: .info }\n    >\n    > This flag can be removed or changed at any time without prior notice.\n\n  - **`+sws default|legacy`{: #+sws }** - Sets scheduler wakeup strategy.\n    Default strategy changed in ERTS 5.10 (Erlang/OTP R16A).

Defaults to `medium`. The threshold determines when to\n    wake up sleeping schedulers when more work than can be handled by currently\n    awake schedulers exists. A low threshold causes earlier wakeups, and a high\n    threshold causes later wakeups. Early wakeups distribute work over multiple\n    schedulers faster, but work does more easily bounce between schedulers.\n\n    > #### Note {: .info }\n    >\n    > This flag can be removed or changed at any time without prior notice.\n\n  - **`+swtdcpu very_low|low|medium|high|very_high`{: #+swtdcpu }** - As\n    [`+swt`](#%2Bswt) but affects dirty CPU schedulers.

Defaults to 1,048,576.\n\n- **`+T Level`{: #+T_level }** - Enables modified timing and sets the modified timing\n  level. Valid range is 0-9. The timing of the runtime system is changed. A high\n  level usually means a greater change than a low level. Changing the timing can\n  be very useful for finding timing-related bugs.\n\n  Modified timing affects the following:\n\n  - **Process spawning** - A process calling `spawn`, `spawn_link`,\n    `spawn_monitor`, or `spawn_opt` is scheduled out immediately after\n    completing the call. When higher modified timing levels are used, the caller\n    also sleeps for a while after it is scheduled out.\n\n  - **Context reductions** - The number of reductions a process is allowed to\n    use before it is scheduled out is increased or reduced.\n\n  - **Input reductions** - The number of reductions performed before checking\n    I/O is increased or reduced.\n\n  > #### Note {: .info }\n  >\n  > Performance suffers when modified timing is enabled.

The current mapping can be retrieved using\n  `error_logger:warning_map/0`. For more information, see\n  `error_logger:warning_map/0` in Kernel.\n\n- **`+zFlag Value`** - Miscellaneous flags:\n\n  - **`+zdbbl size`{: #+zdbbl }** - Sets the distribution buffer busy limit\n    ([`dist_buf_busy_limit`](`m:erlang#system_info_dist_buf_busy_limit`)) in\n    kilobytes. Valid range is 1-2097151. Defaults to 1024.\n\n    A larger buffer limit allows processes to buffer more outgoing messages over\n    the distribution. When the buffer limit has been reached, sending processes\n    will be suspended until the buffer size has shrunk. The buffer limit is per\n    distribution channel. A higher limit gives lower latency and higher\n    throughput at the expense of higher memory use.\n\n    This limit only affects processes that have disabled\n    [_fully asynchronous distributed signaling_](`m:erlang#process_flag_async_dist`).\n\n  - **`+zdntgc time`{: #+zdntgc }** - Sets the delayed node table garbage\n    collection time\n    ([`delayed_node_table_gc`](`m:erlang#system_info_delayed_node_table_gc`)) in\n    seconds. Valid values are either `infinity` or an integer in the range\n    0-100000000. Defaults to 60.\n\n    Node table entries that are not referred linger in the table for at least\n    the amount of time that this parameter determines. The lingering prevents\n    repeated deletions and insertions in the tables from occurring.\n\n  - **`+zosrl limit`{: #+zosrl }** - Sets a limit on the amount of outstanding\n    requests made by a system process orchestrating system wide changes. Valid\n    range of this limit is `[1, 134217727]`. See\n    [`erlang:system_flag(outstanding_system_requests_limit, Limit)`](`m:erlang#system_flag_outstanding_system_requests_limit`)\n    for more information.\n\n  - **`+zhft limit`{: #+zhft }** - Sets a limit on how long the runtime system\n    is allowed to perform [flush](`m:erlang#halt_flush`) operations while\n    [halting](`erlang:halt/2`). Valid ` ` values are integers in the\n    range `0..2147483647` or the word `infinity`. ` ` is in milliseconds\n    and is by default `infinity`.\n\n    If flushing during a halt operation has been ongoing for ` `\n    milliseconds, the flushing will be interrupted and the runtime system will\n    be immediately terminated with exit code `255`. If halting without flushing,\n    the ` ` will have no effect on the system.\n\n    The value set by this flag can be read by Erlang code by calling\n    [`erlang:system_info(halt_flush_timeout)`](`m:erlang#system_info_halt_flush_timeout`).\n\n    See also the [`flush_timeout`](`m:erlang#halt_flush_timeout`) option of the\n    [`erlang:halt/2`](`erlang:halt/2`) BIF.

The emulator\nstarted in this way can be manipulated through the Windows services applet in a\nmanner similar to other services.\n\nNote that `erlsrv` is not a general service utility for Windows, but designed\nfor embedded Erlang systems.\n\n`erlsrv` also provides a command-line interface for registering, changing,\nstarting, and stopping services.\n\nTo manipulate services, the logged on user is to have administrator privileges\non the machine. The Erlang machine itself is (default) run as the local\nadministrator. This can be changed with the Services applet in Windows.\n\nThe processes created by the service can, as opposed to normal services, be\n\"killed\" with the task manager. Killing an emulator that is started by a service\ntriggers the \"OnFail\" action specified for that service, which can be a reboot.\n\nThe following parameters can be specified for each Erlang service:\n\n- **`StopAction`** - Tells `erlsrv` how to stop the Erlang emulator. Default is\n  to kill it (Win32 TerminateProcess), but this action can specify any Erlang\n  shell command that will be executed in the emulator to make it stop. The\n  emulator is expected to stop within 30 seconds after the command is issued in\n  the shell. If the emulator is not stopped, it reports a running state to the\n  service manager.\n\n- **`OnFail`** - Can be one of the following:\n\n  - **`reboot`** - The Windows system is rebooted whenever the emulator stops (a\n    more simple form of watchdog). This can be useful for less critical systems,\n    otherwise use the heart functionality to accomplish this.\n\n  - **`restart`** - Makes the Erlang emulator be restarted (with whatever\n    parameters are registered for the service at the occasion) when it stops. If\n    the emulator stops again within 10 seconds, it is not restarted to avoid an\n    infinite loop, which could hang the Windows system.\n\n  - **`restart_always`** - Similar to `restart`, but does not try to detect\n    cyclic restarts; it is expected that some other mechanism is present to\n    avoid the problem.\n\n  - **`ignore` (the default)** - Reports the service as stopped to the service\n    manager whenever it fails; it must be manually restarted.\n\n  On a system where release handling is used, this is always to be set to\n  `ignore`. Use `heart` to restart the service on failure instead.\n\n- **`Machine`** - The location of the Erlang emulator. The default is the\n  `erl.exe` located in the same directory as `erlsrv.exe`.\n\n  If the system uses release handling, this is to be set to a program similar to\n  `start_erl.exe`.\n\n- **`Env`** - Specifies an _extra_ environment for the emulator. The environment\n  variables specified here are added to the system-wide environment block that\n  is normally present when a service starts up. Variables present in both the\n  system-wide environment and in the service environment specification will be\n  set to the value specified in the service.\n\n- **`WorkDir`** - The working directory for the Erlang emulator. Must be on a\n  local drive (no network drives are mounted when a service starts). Default\n  working directory for services is `%SystemDrive%%SystemPath%`. Debug log files\n  will be placed in this directory.\n\n- **`Priority`** - The process priority of the emulator. Can be one of the\n  following:\n\n  - **`realtime`** - Not recommended, as the machine will possibly be\n    inaccessible to interactive users.\n\n  - **`high`** - Can be used if two Erlang nodes are to reside on one dedicated\n    system and one is to have precedence over the other.\n\n  - **`low`** - Can be used if interactive performance is not to be affected by\n    the emulator process.\n\n  - **`default`** - The default priority.\n\n- **`SName or Name`** - Specifies the short or long node name of the Erlang\n  emulator. The Erlang services are always distributed. Default is to use the\n  service name as (short) nodename.\n\n- **`DebugType`** - Specifies that output from the Erlang shell is to be sent to\n  a \"debug log\". The log file is named  `.debug` or\n   `.debug.` , where   is an integer from 1 through 99. The log\n  file is placed in the working directory of the service (as specified in\n  `WorkDir`).\n\n  Can be one of the following:\n\n  - **`new`** - Uses a separate log file for every invocation of the service\n    ( `.debug.` ).\n\n  - **`reuse`** - Reuses the same log file ( `.debug`).\n\n  - **`console`** - Opens an interactive Windows console window for the Erlang\n    shell of the service. Automatically disables the `StopAction`. A service\n    started with an interactive console window does not survive logouts.\n    `OnFail` actions do not work with debug consoles either.\n\n  - **`none` (the default)** - The output of the Erlang shell is discarded.\n\n  > #### Note {: .info }\n  >\n  > The `console` option is _not_ intended for production. It is _only_ a\n  > convenient way to debug Erlang services during development.\n  >\n  > The `new` and `reuse` options might seem convenient in a production system,\n  > but consider that the logs grow indefinitely during the system lifetime and\n  > cannot be truncated, except if the service is restarted.\n  >\n  > In short, the `DebugType` is intended for debugging only. Logs during\n  > production are better produced with the standard Erlang logging facilities.\n\n- **`Args`** - Passes extra arguments to the emulator startup program `erl.exe`\n  (or `start_erl.exe`). Arguments that cannot be specified here are `-noinput`\n  (`StopActions` would not work), `-name`, and `-sname` (they are specified in\n  any way). The most common use is for specifying cookies and flags to be passed\n  to `m:init` (`-s`).\n\n- **`InternalServiceName`** - Specifies the Windows-internal service name (not\n  the display name, which is the one `erlsrv` uses to identify the service).\n\n  This internal name cannot be changed, it is fixed even if the service is\n  renamed. `erlsrv` generates a unique internal name when a service is created.\n  It is recommended to keep to the default if release handling is to be used for\n  the application.\n\n  The internal service name can be seen in the Windows service manager if\n  viewing `Properties` for an Erlang service.\n\n- **`Comment`** - A textual comment describing the service.

Strange\n>   behaviors that can occur because of lengthy work can also vary between\n>   Erlang/OTP releases.\n\nAs from ERTS 5.9 (Erlang/OTP R15B) the driver interface has been changed with\nlarger types for the callbacks [`output`](driver_entry.md#output),\n[`control`](driver_entry.md#control), and [`call`](driver_entry.md#call). See\ndriver [version management](erl_driver.md#version_management) in\n[`erl_driver`](erl_driver.md).\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> Old drivers (compiled with an `erl_driver.h` from an ERTS version earlier than\n> 5.9) must be updated and have to use the extended interface (with\n> [version management ](erl_driver.md#version_management)).\n\nThe `driver_entry` structure is a C struct that all Erlang drivers define. It\ncontains entry points for the Erlang driver, which are called by the Erlang\nemulator when Erlang code accesses the driver.\n\n[](){: #emulator } The [`erl_driver`](erl_driver.md) driver API functions need a\nport handle that identifies the driver instance (and the port in the emulator).\nThis is only passed to the `start` function, but not to the other functions. The\n`start` function returns a driver-defined handle that is passed to the other\nfunctions. A common practice is to have the `start` function allocate some\napplication-defined structure and stash the `port` handle in it, to use it later\nwith the driver API functions.\n\nThe driver callback functions are called synchronously from the Erlang emulator.\nIf they take too long before completing, they can cause time-outs in the\nemulator. Use the queue or asynchronous calls if necessary, as the emulator must\nbe responsive.\n\nThe driver structure contains the driver name and some 15 function pointers,\nwhich are called at different times by the emulator.\n\nThe only exported function from the driver is `driver_init`. This function\nreturns the `driver_entry` structure that points to the other functions in the\ndriver. The `driver_init` function is declared with a macro,\n`DRIVER_INIT(drivername)`. (This is because different operating systems have\ndifferent names for it.)\n{: #DRIVER_INIT }\n\nWhen writing a driver in C++, the driver entry is to be of `\"C\"` linkage. One\nway to do this is to put the following line somewhere before the driver entry:\n\n```text\nextern \"C\" DRIVER_INIT(drivername);\n```\n\nWhen the driver has passed the `driver_entry` over to the emulator, the driver\nis _not_ allowed to modify the `driver_entry`.\n\nIf compiling a driver for static inclusion through `--enable-static-drivers`,\nyou must define `STATIC_ERLANG_DRIVER` before the `DRIVER_INIT` declaration.\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> Do _not_ declare the `driver_entry` `const`.

The driver is to return `0`, or, if the driver cannot\n  initialize, `-1`.\n\n- **`ErlDrvData (*start)(ErlDrvPort port, char* command)`{: #start }** - Called\n  when the driver is instantiated, when `erlang:open_port/2` is called. The\n  driver is to return a number >= 0 or a pointer, or, if the driver cannot be\n  started, one of three error codes:\n\n  - **`ERL_DRV_ERROR_GENERAL`** - General error, no error code\n\n  - **`ERL_DRV_ERROR_ERRNO`** - Error with error code in `errno`\n\n  - **`ERL_DRV_ERROR_BADARG`** - Error, `badarg`\n\n  If an error code is returned, the port is not started.\n\n- **`void (*stop)(ErlDrvData drv_data)`{: #stop }** - Called when the port is\n  closed, with `erlang:port_close/1` or `Port ! {self(), close}`. Notice that\n  terminating the port owner process also closes the port. If `drv_data` is a\n  pointer to memory allocated in `start`, then `stop` is the place to deallocate\n  that memory.\n\n- **`void (*output)(ErlDrvData drv_data, char *buf, ErlDrvSizeT len)`{: #output }** -\n  Called when an Erlang process has sent data to the port. The data is\n  pointed to by `buf`, and is `len` bytes. Data is sent to the port with\n  `Port ! {self(), {command, Data}}` or with `erlang:port_command/2`. Depending\n  on how the port was opened, it is to be either a list of integers `0...255` or\n  a binary. See `erlang:open_port/2` and `erlang:port_command/2`.\n\n- **`void (*ready_input)(ErlDrvData drv_data, ErlDrvEvent event)`{: #ready_input }**\n\n- **`void (*ready_output)(ErlDrvData drv_data, ErlDrvEvent event)`{: #ready_output }** -\n  Called when a driver event (specified in parameter `event`) is signaled. This is used\n  to help asynchronous drivers \"wake up\" when something occurs.\n\n  On Unix the `event` is a pipe or socket handle (or something that the `select`\n  system call understands).\n\n  On Windows the `event` is an `Event` or `Semaphore` (or something that the\n  `WaitForMultipleObjects` API function understands). (Some trickery in the\n  emulator allows more than the built-in limit of 64 `Events` to be used.)\n\n  To use this with threads and asynchronous routines, create a pipe on Unix and\n  an `Event` on Windows. When the routine completes, write to the pipe (use\n  `SetEvent` on Windows), this makes the emulator call `ready_input` or\n  `ready_output`.\n\n  False events can occur. That is, calls to `ready_input` or `ready_output`\n  although no real events are signaled. In reality, it is rare (and\n  OS-dependant), but a robust driver must nevertheless be able to handle such\n  cases.\n\n- **`char *driver_name`{: #driver_name }** - The driver name. It must correspond\n  to the atom used in `erlang:open_port/2`, and the name of the driver library\n  file (without the extension).\n\n- **`void (*finish)(void)`{: #finish }** - Called by the `erl_ddll` driver when\n  the driver is unloaded. (It is only called in dynamic drivers.)\n\n  The driver is only unloaded as a result of calling `erl_ddll:unload_driver/1`,\n  or when the emulator halts.\n\n- **`void *handle`** - This field is reserved for the emulator's internal use.\n  The emulator will modify this field, so it is important that the\n  `driver_entry` is not declared `const`.\n\n- __`ErlDrvSSizeT (*control)(ErlDrvData drv_data, unsigned int command, char *buf, ErlDrvSizeT len, char **rbuf, ErlDrvSizeT rlen)`__{: #control } -\n  A special routine invoked with `erlang:port_control/3`. It\n  works a little like an \"ioctl\" for Erlang drivers. The data specified to\n  [`port_control/3`](`port_control/3`) arrives in `buf` and `len`. The driver\n  can send data back, using `*rbuf` and `rlen`.\n\n  This is the fastest way of calling a driver and get a response. It makes no\n  context switch in the Erlang emulator and requires no message passing. It is\n  suitable for calling C function to get faster execution, when Erlang is too\n  slow.\n\n  If the driver wants to return data, it is to return it in `rbuf`. When\n  `control` is called, `*rbuf` points to a default buffer of `rlen` bytes, which\n  can be used to return data. Data is returned differently depending on the port\n  control flags (those that are set with\n  [`erl_driver:set_port_control_flags`](erl_driver.md#set_port_control_flags)).\n\n  If the flag is set to `PORT_CONTROL_FLAG_BINARY`, a binary is returned. Small\n  binaries can be returned by writing the raw data into the default buffer. A\n  binary can also be returned by setting `*rbuf` to point to a binary allocated\n  with [`erl_driver:driver_alloc_binary`](erl_driver.md#driver_alloc_binary).\n  This binary is freed automatically after `control` has returned. The driver\n  can retain the binary for _read only_ access with\n  [`erl_driver:driver_binary_inc_refc`](erl_driver.md#driver_binary_inc_refc) to\n  be freed later with\n  [`erl_driver:driver_free_binary`](erl_driver.md#driver_free_binary). It is\n  never allowed to change the binary after `control` has returned. If `*rbuf` is\n  set to `NULL`, an empty list is returned.\n\n  If the flag is set to `0`, data is returned as a list of integers. Either use\n  the default buffer or set `*rbuf` to point to a larger buffer allocated with\n  [`erl_driver:driver_alloc`](erl_driver.md#driver_alloc). The buffer is freed\n  automatically after `control` has returned.\n\n  Using binaries is faster if more than a few bytes are returned.\n\n  The return value is the number of bytes returned in `*rbuf`.\n\n- **`void (*timeout)(ErlDrvData drv_data)`{: #timeout }** - Called any time\n  after the driver's timer reaches `0`. The timer is activated with\n  [`erl_driver:driver_set_timer`](erl_driver.md#driver_set_timer). No priorities\n  or ordering exist among drivers, so if several drivers time out at the same\n  time, anyone of them is called first.\n\n- **`void (*outputv)(ErlDrvData drv_data, ErlIOVec *ev)`{: #outputv }** - Called\n  whenever the port is written to. If it is `NULL`, the `output` function is\n  called instead. This function is faster than `output`, as it takes an\n  `ErlIOVec` directly, which requires no copying of the data. The port is to be\n  in binary mode, see `erlang:open_port/2`.\n\n  `ErlIOVec` contains both a `SysIOVec`, suitable for `writev`, and one or more\n  binaries. If these binaries are to be retained when the driver returns from\n  `outputv`, they can be queued (using, for example,\n  [`erl_driver:driver_enq_bin`](erl_driver.md#driver_enq_bin)) or, if they are\n  kept in a static or global variable, the reference counter can be incremented.\n\n- **`void (*ready_async)(ErlDrvData drv_data, ErlDrvThreadData thread_data)`{: #ready_async }** -\n  Called after an asynchronous call has completed. The asynchronous call is started with\n  [`erl_driver:driver_async`](erl_driver.md#driver_async). This function is\n  called from the Erlang emulator thread, as opposed to the asynchronous\n  function, which is called in some thread (if multi-threading is enabled).\n\n- **`void (*flush)(ErlDrvData drv_data)`** - Called when the port is about to be\n  closed, and there is data in the driver queue that must be flushed before\n  'stop' can be called.\n\n- __`ErlDrvSSizeT (*call)(ErlDrvData drv_data, unsigned int command, char *buf, ErlDrvSizeT len, char **rbuf, ErlDrvSizeT rlen, unsigned int *flags)`__{: #call } -\n  Called from `erlang:port_call/3`. It works a lot like the\n  `control` callback, but uses the external term format for input and output.\n\n  `command` is an integer, obtained from the call from Erlang (the second\n  argument to `erlang:port_call/3`).\n\n  `buf` and `len` provide the arguments to the call (the third argument to\n  `erlang:port_call/3`). They can be decoded using `ei` functions.\n\n  `rbuf` points to a return buffer, `rlen` bytes long. The return data is to be\n  a valid Erlang term in the external (binary) format. This is converted to an\n  Erlang term and returned by `erlang:port_call/3` to the caller. If more space\n  than `rlen` bytes is needed to return data, `*rbuf` can be set to memory\n  allocated with [`erl_driver:driver_alloc`](erl_driver.md#driver_alloc). This\n  memory is freed automatically after `call` has returned.\n\n  The return value is the number of bytes returned in `*rbuf`. If\n  `ERL_DRV_ERROR_GENERAL` is returned (or in fact, anything < 0),\n  `erlang:port_call/3` throws a `BAD_ARG`.\n\n- **`void (*event)(ErlDrvData drv_data, ErlDrvEvent event, ErlDrvEventData event_data)`** -\n  Intentionally left undocumented.\n\n- **`int extended_marker`{: #extended_marker }** - This field is either to be\n  equal to `ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER` or `0`. An old driver (not aware of the\n  extended driver interface) is to set this field to `0`. If this field is `0`,\n  all the following fields _must_ also be `0`, or `NULL` if it is a pointer\n  field.\n\n- **`int major_version`** - This field is to equal\n  `ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION` if field `extended_marker` equals\n  `ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER`.\n\n- **`int minor_version`** - This field is to equal\n  `ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MINOR_VERSION` if field `extended_marker` equals\n  `ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER`.\n\n- **`int driver_flags`{: #driver_flags }** - This field is used to pass driver\n  capability and other information to the runtime system. If field\n  `extended_marker` equals `ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER`, it is to contain `0` or\n  driver flags (`ERL_DRV_FLAG_*`) OR'ed bitwise. The following driver flags\n  exist:\n\n  - **`ERL_DRV_FLAG_USE_PORT_LOCKING`** - The runtime system uses port-level\n    locking on all ports executing this driver instead of driver-level locking.\n    For more information, see [`erl_driver`](erl_driver.md#smp_support).\n\n  - **`ERL_DRV_FLAG_SOFT_BUSY`** - Marks that driver instances can handle being\n    called in the [`output`](driver_entry.md#output) and/or\n    [`outputv`](driver_entry.md#outputv) callbacks although a driver instance\n    has marked itself as busy (see\n    [`erl_driver:set_busy_port`](erl_driver.md#set_busy_port)). As from ERTS\n    5.7.4 this flag is required for drivers used by the Erlang distribution (the\n    behavior has always been required by drivers used by the distribution).\n\n  - **`ERL_DRV_FLAG_NO_BUSY_MSGQ`** - Disables busy port message queue\n    functionality.

The extended interface\nintroduces [version management](erl_driver.md#version_management), the\npossibility to pass capability flags (see\n[`driver_flags`](driver_entry.md#driver_flags)) to the runtime system at driver\ninitialization, and some new driver API functions.\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> As from ERTS 5.9 old drivers must be recompiled and use the extended\n> interface. They must also be adjusted to the\n> [64-bit capable driver interface](erl_driver.md#rewrites_for_64_bits).\n\nThe driver calls back to the emulator, using the API functions declared in\n`erl_driver.h`. They are used for outputting data from the driver, using timers,\nand so on.\n\nEach driver instance is associated with a port. Every port has a port owner\nprocess. Communication with the port is normally done through the port owner\nprocess. Most of the functions take the `port` handle as an argument. This\nidentifies the driver instance. Notice that this port handle must be stored by\nthe driver, it is not given when the driver is called from the emulator (see\n[`driver_entry`](driver_entry.md#emulator)).\n\nSome of the functions take a parameter of type `ErlDrvBinary`, a driver binary.\nIt is to be both allocated and freed by the caller. Using a binary directly\navoids one extra copying of data.\n\nMany of the output functions have a \"header buffer\", with `hbuf` and `hlen`\nparameters. This buffer is sent as a list before the binary (or list, depending\non port mode) that is sent. This is convenient when matching on messages\nreceived from the port. (Although in the latest Erlang versions there is the\nbinary syntax, which enables you to match on the beginning of a binary.)\n\n[](){: #smp_support } Drivers are locked either on driver level or port level\n(driver instance level). By default driver level locking will be used, that is,\nonly one emulator thread will execute code in the driver at a time. If port\nlevel locking is used, multiple emulator threads can execute code in the driver\nat the same time. Only one thread at a time will call driver callbacks\ncorresponding to the same port, though. To enable port level locking, set the\n`ERL_DRV_FLAG_USE_PORT_LOCKING` [driver flag](driver_entry.md#driver_flags) in\nthe [`driver_entry`](driver_entry.md) used by the driver. When port level\nlocking is used, the driver writer is responsible for synchronizing all accesses\nto data shared by the ports (driver instances).\n\nMost drivers written before the runtime system with SMP support existed can run\nin the runtime system with SMP support, without being rewritten, if driver level\nlocking is used.\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> It is assumed that drivers do not access other drivers.

Functions that are not documented as thread-safe\ncan only be called from driver callbacks or function calls descending from a\ndriver callback call. Notice that driver callbacks can be called from different\nthreads. This, however, is not a problem for any function in this API, as the\nemulator has control over these threads.\n\n> #### Warning {: .warning }\n>\n> Functions not explicitly documented as thread-safe are _not_ thread safe.\n>\n> A function not explicitly documented as thread-safe can, at some point in\n> time, have a thread-safe implementation in the runtime system.

It is difficult to give an exact maximum\namount of time that a driver callback is allowed to work, but usually a\nwell-behaving driver callback is to return within 1 millisecond. This can be\nachieved using different approaches. If you have full control over the code to\nexecute in the driver callback, the best approach is to divide the work into\nmultiple chunks of work, and trigger multiple calls to the\n[time-out callback](driver_entry.md#timeout) using zero time-outs. Function\n[`erl_drv_consume_timeslice`](erl_driver.md#erl_drv_consume_timeslice) can be\nuseful to determine when to trigger such time-out callback calls. However,\nsometimes it cannot be implemented this way, for example when calling\nthird-party libraries. In this case, you typically want to dispatch the work to\nanother thread. Information about thread primitives is provided below.","ref":"erl_driver.html#description"},{"type":"extras","title":"Functionality - erl_driver","doc":"All functions that a driver needs to do with Erlang are performed through driver\nAPI functions. Functions exist for the following functionality:\n\n- **Timer functions** - Control the timer that a driver can use. The timer has\n  the emulator call the [`timeout`](driver_entry.md#timeout) entry function\n  after a specified time. Only one timer is available for each driver instance.\n\n- **Queue handling** - Every driver instance has an associated queue. This queue\n  is a `SysIOVec`, which works as a buffer. It is mostly used for the driver to\n  buffer data that is to be written to a device, it is a byte stream. If the\n  port owner process closes the driver, and the queue is not empty, the driver\n  is not closed. This enables the driver to flush its buffers before closing.\n\n  The queue can be manipulated from any threads if a port data lock is used. For\n  more information, see [`ErlDrvPDL`](erl_driver.md#ErlDrvPDL).\n\n- **Output functions** - With these functions, the driver sends data back to the\n  emulator. The data is received as messages by the port owner process, see\n  `erlang:open_port/2`. The vector function and the function taking a driver\n  binary are faster, as they avoid copying the data buffer. There is also a fast\n  way of sending terms from the driver, without going through the binary term\n  format.\n\n- **Failure** - The driver can exit and signal errors up to Erlang. This is only\n  for severe errors, when the driver cannot possibly keep open.\n\n- **Asynchronous calls** - Erlang/OTP R7B and later versions have provision for\n  asynchronous function calls, using a thread pool provided by Erlang. There is\n  also a select call, which can be used for asynchronous drivers.\n\n- **[](){: #multi_threading } Multi-threading**  \n  A POSIX thread like API for multi-threading is provided. The Erlang driver\n  thread API only provides a subset of the functionality provided by the POSIX\n  thread API. The subset provided is more or less the basic functionality needed\n  for multi-threaded programming:\n\n  - [Threads](erl_driver.md#ErlDrvTid)\n  - [Mutexes](erl_driver.md#ErlDrvMutex)\n  - [Condition variables](erl_driver.md#ErlDrvCond)\n  - [Read/write locks](erl_driver.md#ErlDrvRWLock)\n  - [Thread-specific data](erl_driver.md#ErlDrvTSDKey)\n\n  The Erlang driver thread API can be used in conjunction with the POSIX thread\n  API on UN-ices and with the Windows native thread API on Windows. The Erlang\n  driver thread API has the advantage of being portable, but there can exist\n  situations where you want to use functionality from the POSIX thread API or\n  the Windows native thread API.\n\n  The Erlang driver thread API only returns error codes when it is reasonable to\n  recover from an error condition. If it is not reasonable to recover from an\n  error condition, the whole runtime system is terminated. For example, if a\n  create mutex operation fails, an error code is returned, but if a lock\n  operation on a mutex fails, the whole runtime system is terminated.\n\n  Notice that there is no \"condition variable wait with time-out\" in the Erlang\n  driver thread API. This because of issues with `pthread_cond_timedwait`. When\n  the system clock suddenly is changed, it is not always guaranteed that you\n  will wake up from the call as expected. An Erlang runtime system must be able\n  to cope with sudden changes of the system clock. Therefore, we have omitted it\n  from the Erlang driver thread API. In the Erlang driver case, time-outs can\n  and are to be handled with the timer functionality of the Erlang driver API.\n\n  Notice that many functions in the Erlang driver API are _not_ thread-safe. If\n  a function is not documented as thread-safe, it is _not_ thread-safe.\n\n  > #### Note {: .info }\n  >\n  > When executing in an emulator thread, it is _very important_ that you unlock\n  > _all_ locks you have locked before letting the thread out of your control;\n  > otherwise you are _very likely_ to deadlock the whole emulator.\n  >\n  > If you need to use thread-specific data in an emulator thread, only have the\n  > thread-specific data set while the thread is under your control, and clear\n  > the thread-specific data before you let the thread out of your control.\n\n  In the future, debug functionality will probably be integrated with the Erlang\n  driver thread API. All functions that create entities take a `name` argument.\n  Currently the `name` argument is unused, but it will be used when the debug\n  functionality is implemented. If you name all entities created well, the debug\n  functionality will be able to give you better error reports.\n\n- **Adding/removing drivers** - A driver can add and later remove drivers.\n\n- **Monitoring processes** - A driver can monitor a process that does not own a\n  port.\n\n- **[](){: #version_management } Version management**  \n  Version management is enabled for drivers that have set the\n  [`extended_marker`](driver_entry.md#extended_marker) field of their\n  [`driver_entry`](driver_entry.md) to `ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER`. `erl_driver.h`\n  defines:\n\n  - `ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER`\n  - `ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION`, which is incremented when driver\n    incompatible changes are made to the Erlang runtime system. Normally it\n    suffices to recompile drivers when `ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION` has\n    changed, but it can, under rare circumstances, mean that drivers must be\n    slightly modified. If so, this will of course be documented.\n  - `ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MINOR_VERSION`, which is incremented when new features are\n    added. The runtime system uses the minor version of the driver to determine\n    what features to use.\n\n  The runtime system normally refuses to load a driver if the major versions\n  differ, or if the major versions are equal and the minor version used by the\n  driver is greater than the one used by the runtime system. Old drivers with\n  lower major versions are however allowed after a bump of the major version\n  during a transition period of two major releases. Such old drivers can,\n  however, fail if deprecated features are used.\n\n  The emulator refuses to load a driver that does not use the extended driver\n  interface, to allow for 64-bit capable drivers, as incompatible type changes\n  for the callbacks [`output`](driver_entry.md#output),\n  [`control`](driver_entry.md#control), and [`call`](driver_entry.md#call) were\n  introduced in Erlang/OTP R15B. A driver written with the old types would\n  compile with warnings and when called return garbage sizes to the emulator,\n  causing it to read random memory and create huge incorrect result blobs.\n\n  Therefore it is not enough to only recompile drivers written with version\n  management for pre R15B types; the types must be changed in the driver\n  suggesting other rewrites, especially regarding size variables. _Investigate\n  all warnings when recompiling._\n\n  Also, the API driver functions `driver_output*` and `driver_vec_to_buf`,\n  `driver_alloc/realloc*`, and the `driver_*` queue functions were changed to\n  have larger length arguments and return values. This is a lesser problem, as\n  code that passes smaller types gets them auto-converted in the calls, and as\n  long as the driver does not handle sizes that overflow an `int`, all will work\n  as before.\n\n- **[](){: #time_measurement } Time measurement**  \n  Support for time measurement in drivers:\n\n  - [`ErlDrvTime`](erl_driver.md#ErlDrvTime)\n  - [`ErlDrvTimeUnit`](erl_driver.md#ErlDrvTimeUnit)\n  - [`erl_drv_monotonic_time`](erl_driver.md#erl_drv_monotonic_time)\n  - [`erl_drv_time_offset`](erl_driver.md#erl_drv_time_offset)\n  - [`erl_drv_convert_time_unit`](erl_driver.md#erl_drv_convert_time_unit)\n\n[](){: #rewrites_for_64_bits }","ref":"erl_driver.html#functionality"},{"type":"extras","title":"Rewrites for 64-Bit Driver Interface - erl_driver","doc":"ERTS 5.9 introduced two new integer types,\n[`ErlDrvSizeT`](erl_driver.md#ErlDrvSizeT) and\n[`ErlDrvSSizeT`](erl_driver.md#ErlDrvSSizeT), which can hold 64-bit sizes if\nnecessary.\n\nTo not update a driver and only recompile, it probably works when building for a\n32-bit machine creating a false sense of security. Hopefully that will generate\nmany important warnings. But when recompiling the same driver later on for a\n64-bit machine, there _will_ be warnings and almost certainly crashes. So it is\na _bad_ idea to postpone updating the driver and not fixing the warnings.\n\nWhen recompiling with `gcc`, use flag `-Wstrict-prototypes` to get better\nwarnings. Try to find a similar flag if you use another compiler.\n\nThe following is a checklist for rewriting a pre ERTS 5.9 driver, most important\nfirst:\n\n- **Return types for driver callbacks** - Rewrite driver callback\n  [`control`](driver_entry.md#control) to use return type `ErlDrvSSizeT` instead\n  of `int`.\n\n  Rewrite driver callback [`call`](driver_entry.md#call) to use return type\n  `ErlDrvSSizeT` instead of `int`.\n\n  > #### Note {: .info }\n  >\n  > These changes are essential not to crash the emulator or worse cause\n  > malfunction.

Also the driver callback\n  [`outputv`](driver_entry.md#outputv) uses driver binaries.\n\n  If the driver for some reason wants to keep a driver binary around, for\n  example in a static variable, the reference count is to be incremented, and\n  the binary can later be freed in the [`stop`](driver_entry.md#stop) callback,\n  with `driver_free_binary`.\n\n  Notice that as a driver binary is shared by the driver and the emulator. A\n  binary received from the emulator or sent to the emulator must not be changed\n  by the driver.\n\n  Since ERTS 5.5 (Erlang/OTP R11B), `orig_bytes` is guaranteed to be properly\n  aligned for storage of an array of doubles (usually 8-byte aligned).\n\n- **`ErlDrvData`** - A handle to driver-specific data, passed to the driver\n  callbacks. It is a pointer, and is most often type cast to a specific pointer\n  in the driver.\n\n- **`SysIOVec`** - A system I/O vector, as used by `writev` on Unix and\n  `WSASend` on Win32. It is used in `ErlIOVec`.\n\n- **`ErlIOVec`{: #ErlIOVec }**\n\n  ```c\n  typedef struct ErlIOVec {\n    int vsize;\n    ErlDrvSizeT size;\n    SysIOVec* iov;\n    ErlDrvBinary** binv;\n  } ErlIOVec;\n  ```\n\n  The I/O vector used by the emulator and drivers is a list of binaries, with a\n  `SysIOVec` pointing to the buffers of the binaries. It is used in\n  `driver_outputv` and the [`outputv`](driver_entry.md#outputv) driver callback.\n  Also, the driver queue is an `ErlIOVec`.\n\n- **`ErlDrvMonitor`** - When a driver creates a monitor for a process, a\n  `ErlDrvMonitor` is filled in. This is an opaque data type that can be assigned\n  to, but not compared without using the supplied compare function (that is, it\n  behaves like a struct).\n\n  The driver writer is to provide the memory for storing the monitor when\n  calling [`driver_monitor_process`](erl_driver.md#driver_monitor_process). The\n  address of the data is not stored outside of the driver, so `ErlDrvMonitor`\n  can be used as any other data, it can be copied, moved in memory, forgotten,\n  and so on.\n\n- **`ErlDrvNowData`{: #ErlDrvNowData }** - The `ErlDrvNowData` structure holds a\n  time stamp consisting of three values measured from some arbitrary point in\n  the past. The three structure members are:\n\n  - **`megasecs`** - The number of whole megaseconds elapsed since the arbitrary\n    point in time\n\n  - **`secs`** - The number of whole seconds elapsed since the arbitrary point\n    in time\n\n  - **`microsecs`** - The number of whole microseconds elapsed since the\n    arbitrary point in time\n\n- **`ErlDrvPDL`{: #ErlDrvPDL }** - If certain port-specific data must be\n  accessed from other threads than those calling the driver callbacks, a port\n  data lock can be used to synchronize the operations on the data. Currently,\n  the only port-specific data that the emulator associates with the port data\n  lock is the driver queue.\n\n  Normally a driver instance has no port data lock. If the driver instance wants\n  to use a port data lock, it must create the port data lock by calling\n  [`driver_pdl_create`](erl_driver.md#driver_pdl_create).\n\n  > #### Note {: .info }\n  >\n  > Once the port data lock has been created, every access to data associated\n  > with the port data lock must be done while the port data lock is locked. The\n  > port data lock is locked and unlocked by\n  > [`driver_pdl_lock`](erl_driver.md#driver_pdl_lock), and\n  > [`driver_pdl_unlock`](erl_driver.md#driver_pdl_unlock), respectively.\n\n  A port data lock is reference counted, and when the reference count reaches\n  zero, it is destroyed. The emulator at least increments the reference count\n  once when the lock is created and decrements it once the port associated with\n  the lock terminates. The emulator also increments the reference count when an\n  async job is enqueued and decrements it when an async job has been invoked.\n  Also, the driver is responsible for ensuring that the reference count does not\n  reach zero before the last use of the lock by the driver has been made. The\n  reference count can be read, incremented, and decremented by\n  [`driver_pdl_get_refc`](erl_driver.md#driver_pdl_get_refc),\n  [`driver_pdl_inc_refc`](erl_driver.md#driver_pdl_inc_refc), and\n  [`driver_pdl_dec_refc`](erl_driver.md#driver_pdl_dec_refc), respectively.\n\n- **`ErlDrvTid`{: #ErlDrvTid }** - Thread identifier.\n\n  See also [`erl_drv_thread_create`](erl_driver.md#erl_drv_thread_create),\n  [`erl_drv_thread_exit`](erl_driver.md#erl_drv_thread_exit),\n  [`erl_drv_thread_join`](erl_driver.md#erl_drv_thread_join),\n  [`erl_drv_thread_self`](erl_driver.md#erl_drv_thread_self), and\n  [`erl_drv_equal_tids`](erl_driver.md#erl_drv_equal_tids).\n\n- **`ErlDrvThreadOpts`{: #ErlDrvThreadOpts }**\n\n  ```text\n  int suggested_stack_size;\n  ```\n\n  Thread options structure passed to\n  [`erl_drv_thread_create`](erl_driver.md#erl_drv_thread_create).

The function `async_invoke` is invoked in a\nthread separate from the emulator thread. This enables the driver to perform\ntime-consuming, blocking operations without blocking the emulator.\n\nThe async thread pool size can be set with command-line argument\n[`+A`](erl_cmd.md#async_thread_pool_size) in [`erl(1)`](erl_cmd.md). If an async\nthread pool is unavailable, the call is made synchronously in the thread calling\n`driver_async`.

Functions exist for the following functionality:\n\n- **Read and write Erlang terms** - Any Erlang terms can be passed to a NIF as\n  function arguments and be returned as function return values. The terms are of\n  C-type [`ERL_NIF_TERM`](erl_nif.md#ERL_NIF_TERM) and can only be read or\n  written using API functions. Most functions to read the content of a term are\n  prefixed `enif_get_` and usually return `true` (or `false`) if the term is of\n  the expected type (or not). The functions to write terms are all prefixed\n  `enif_make_` and usually return the created `ERL_NIF_TERM`. There are also\n  some functions to query terms, like `enif_is_atom`, `enif_is_identical`, and\n  `enif_compare`.\n\n  All terms of type `ERL_NIF_TERM` belong to an environment of type\n  [`ErlNifEnv`](erl_nif.md#ErlNifEnv), except atoms created during loading (by\n  callbacks [`load`](erl_nif.md#load) or [`upgrade`](erl_nif.md#upgrade)). The\n  lifetime of a term is controlled by the lifetime of its environment object.\n  All API functions that read or write terms have the environment that the term\n  belongs to as the first function argument. However, the atoms created during\n  loading can be referred as a term in any `ErlNifEnv`. That is, the best\n  practice it to create all your atoms during loading and store them in\n  static/global variables, for example:\n\n  ```c\n  #include  \n\n  ERL_NIF_TERM world_atom;\n\n  static int load(ErlNifEnv* env, void** priv_data, ERL_NIF_TERM load_info)\n  {\n      world_atom = enif_make_atom(env, \"world\");\n      return 0;\n  }\n\n  static ERL_NIF_TERM hello(ErlNifEnv* env, int argc, const ERL_NIF_TERM argv[])\n  {\n      ERL_NIF_TERM hello_string = enif_make_string(env, \"Hello\", ERL_NIF_LATIN1);\n      return enif_make_tuple2(env, hello_string, world_atom);\n  }\n\n  static ErlNifFunc nif_funcs[] = { { \"hello\", 0, hello } };\n\n  ERL_NIF_INIT(niftest, nif_funcs, load, NULL, NULL, NULL)\n  ```\n\n- **Binaries** - Terms of type binary are accessed with the help of struct type\n  [`ErlNifBinary`](erl_nif.md#ErlNifBinary), which contains a pointer (`data`)\n  to the raw binary data and the length (`size`) of the data in bytes. Both\n  `data` and `size` are read-only and are only to be written using calls to API\n  functions. Instances of `ErlNifBinary` are, however, always allocated by the\n  user (usually as local variables).\n\n  The raw data pointed to by `data` is only mutable after a call to\n  [`enif_alloc_binary`](erl_nif.md#enif_alloc_binary) or\n  [`enif_realloc_binary`](erl_nif.md#enif_realloc_binary). All other functions\n  that operate on a binary leave the data as read-only. A mutable binary must in\n  the end either be freed with\n  [`enif_release_binary`](erl_nif.md#enif_release_binary) or made read-only by\n  transferring it to an Erlang term with\n  [`enif_make_binary`](erl_nif.md#enif_make_binary). However, it does not have\n  to occur in the same NIF call. Read-only binaries do not have to be released.\n\n  [`enif_make_new_binary`](erl_nif.md#enif_make_new_binary) can be used as a\n  shortcut to allocate and return a binary in the same NIF call.\n\n  Binaries are sequences of whole bytes. Bitstrings with an arbitrary bit length\n  have no support yet.\n\n- **Resource objects**{: #resource_objects }  \n  The use of resource objects is a safe way to return pointers to native data\n  structures from a NIF. A resource object is only a block of memory allocated\n  with [`enif_alloc_resource`](erl_nif.md#enif_alloc_resource). A handle (\"safe\n  pointer\") to this memory block can then be returned to Erlang by the use of\n  [`enif_make_resource`](erl_nif.md#enif_make_resource). The term returned by\n  `enif_make_resource` is opaque in nature. It can be stored and passed between\n  processes, but the only real end usage is to pass it back as an argument to a\n  NIF. The NIF can then call [`enif_get_resource`](erl_nif.md#enif_get_resource)\n  and get back a pointer to the memory block, which is guaranteed to still be\n  valid. A resource object is not deallocated until the last handle term is\n  garbage collected by the VM and the resource is released with\n  [`enif_release_resource`](erl_nif.md#enif_release_resource) (not necessarily\n  in that order).\n\n  All resource objects are created as instances of some _resource type_. This\n  makes resources from different modules to be distinguishable. A resource type\n  is created by calling\n  [`enif_open_resource_type`](erl_nif.md#enif_open_resource_type) when a library\n  is loaded. Objects of that resource type can then later be allocated and\n  `enif_get_resource` verifies that the resource is of the expected type. A\n  resource type can have a user-supplied destructor function, which is\n  automatically called when resources of that type are released (by either the\n  garbage collector or `enif_release_resource`). Resource types are uniquely\n  identified by a supplied name string and the name of the implementing module.\n\n  [](){: #enif_resource_example } The following is a template example of how to\n  create and return a resource object.\n\n  ```c\n  ERL_NIF_TERM term;\n  MyStruct* obj = enif_alloc_resource(my_resource_type, sizeof(MyStruct));\n\n  /* initialize struct ... */\n\n  term = enif_make_resource(env, obj);\n\n  if (keep_a_reference_of_our_own) {\n      /* store 'obj' in static variable, private data or other resource object */\n  }\n  else {\n      enif_release_resource(obj);\n      /* resource now only owned by \"Erlang\" */\n  }\n  return term;\n  ```\n\n  Notice that once `enif_make_resource` creates the term to return to Erlang,\n  the code can choose to either keep its own native pointer to the allocated\n  struct and release it later, or release it immediately and rely only on the\n  garbage collector to deallocate the resource object eventually when it\n  collects the term.\n\n  Another use of resource objects is to create binary terms with user-defined\n  memory management.\n  [`enif_make_resource_binary`](erl_nif.md#enif_make_resource_binary) creates a\n  binary term that is connected to a resource object. The destructor of the\n  resource is called when the binary is garbage collected, at which time the\n  binary data can be released. An example of this can be a binary term\n  consisting of data from a `mmap`'ed file. The destructor can then do `munmap`\n  to release the memory region.\n\n  Resource types support upgrade in runtime by allowing a loaded NIF library to\n  take over an already existing resource type and by that \"inherit\" all existing\n  objects of that type. The destructor of the new library is thereafter called\n  for the inherited objects and the library with the old destructor function can\n  be safely unloaded. Existing resource objects, of a module that is upgraded,\n  must either be deleted or taken over by the new NIF library. The unloading of\n  a library is postponed as long as there exist resource objects with a\n  destructor function in the library.\n\n- **Module upgrade and static data** - A loaded NIF library is tied to the\n  Erlang module instance that loaded it. If the module is upgraded, the new\n  module instance needs to load its own NIF library (or maybe choose not to).\n  The new module instance can, however, choose to load the exact same NIF\n  library as the old code if it wants to. Sharing the dynamic library means that\n  static data defined by the library is shared as well. To avoid unintentionally\n  shared static data between module instances, each Erlang module version can\n  keep its own private data. This private data can be set when the NIF library\n  is loaded and later retrieved by calling\n  [`enif_priv_data`](erl_nif.md#enif_priv_data).\n\n- **Threads and concurrency** - A NIF is thread-safe without any explicit\n  synchronization as long as it acts as a pure function and only reads the\n  supplied arguments. When you write to a shared state either through static\n  variables or [`enif_priv_data`](erl_nif.md#enif_priv_data), you need to supply\n  your own explicit synchronization. This includes terms in process independent\n  environments that are shared between threads. Resource objects also require\n  synchronization if you treat them as mutable.\n\n  The library initialization callbacks `load` and `upgrade` are thread-safe even\n  for shared state data.\n\n- **Version Management**{: #version_management } -\n  When a NIF library is built, information about the NIF API version is compiled\n  into the library. When a NIF library is loaded, the runtime system verifies\n  that the library is of a compatible version. `erl_nif.h` defines the\n  following:\n\n  - **`ERL_NIF_MAJOR_VERSION`** - Incremented when NIF library incompatible\n    changes are made to the Erlang runtime system. Normally it suffices to\n    recompile the NIF library when the `ERL_NIF_MAJOR_VERSION` has changed, but\n    it can, under rare circumstances, mean that NIF libraries must be slightly\n    modified. If so, this will of course be documented.\n\n  - **`ERL_NIF_MINOR_VERSION`** - Incremented when new features are added. The\n    runtime system uses the minor version to determine what features to use.\n\n  The runtime system normally refuses to load a NIF library if the major\n  versions differ, or if the major versions are equal and the minor version used\n  by the NIF library is greater than the one used by the runtime system. Old NIF\n  libraries with lower major versions are, however, allowed after a bump of the\n  major version during a transition period of two major releases. Such old NIF\n  libraries can however fail if deprecated features are used.\n\n- **Time Measurement**{: #time_measurement } -\n  Support for time measurement in NIF libraries:\n\n  - [`ErlNifTime`](erl_nif.md#ErlNifTime)\n  - [`ErlNifTimeUnit`](erl_nif.md#ErlNifTimeUnit)\n  - [`enif_monotonic_time()`](erl_nif.md#enif_monotonic_time)\n  - [`enif_time_offset()`](erl_nif.md#enif_time_offset)\n  - [`enif_convert_time_unit()`](erl_nif.md#enif_convert_time_unit)\n\n- **I/O Queues**{: #enif_ioq }  \n  The Erlang nif library contains function for easily working with I/O vectors\n  as used by the unix system call `writev`. The I/O Queue is not thread safe, so\n  some other synchronization mechanism has to be used.\n\n  - [`SysIOVec`](erl_nif.md#SysIOVec)\n  - [`ErlNifIOVec`](erl_nif.md#ErlNifIOVec)\n  - [`enif_ioq_create()`](erl_nif.md#enif_ioq_create)\n  - [`enif_ioq_destroy()`](erl_nif.md#enif_ioq_destroy)\n  - [`enif_ioq_enq_binary()`](erl_nif.md#enif_ioq_enq_binary)\n  - [`enif_ioq_enqv()`](erl_nif.md#enif_ioq_enqv)\n  - [`enif_ioq_deq()`](erl_nif.md#enif_ioq_deq)\n  - [`enif_ioq_peek()`](erl_nif.md#enif_ioq_peek)\n  - [`enif_ioq_peek_head()`](erl_nif.md#enif_ioq_peek_head)\n  - [`enif_inspect_iovec()`](erl_nif.md#enif_inspect_iovec)\n  - [`enif_free_iovec()`](erl_nif.md#enif_free_iovec)\n\n  Typical usage when writing to a file descriptor looks like this:\n\n  ```c\n  int writeiovec(ErlNifEnv *env, ERL_NIF_TERM term, ERL_NIF_TERM *tail,\n                 ErlNifIOQueue *q, int fd) {\n\n      ErlNifIOVec vec, *iovec = &vec;\n      SysIOVec *sysiovec;\n      int saved_errno;\n      int iovcnt, n;\n\n      if (!enif_inspect_iovec(env, 64, term, tail, &iovec))\n          return -2;\n\n      if (enif_ioq_size(q) > 0) {\n          /* If the I/O queue contains data we enqueue the iovec and\n             then peek the data to write out of the queue. */\n          if (!enif_ioq_enqv(q, iovec, 0))\n              return -3;\n\n          sysiovec = enif_ioq_peek(q, &iovcnt);\n      } else {\n          /* If the I/O queue is empty we skip the trip through it. */\n          iovcnt = iovec->iovcnt;\n          sysiovec = iovec->iov;\n      }\n\n      /* Attempt to write the data */\n      n = writev(fd, sysiovec, iovcnt);\n      saved_errno = errno;\n\n      if (enif_ioq_size(q) == 0) {\n          /* If the I/O queue was initially empty we enqueue any\n             remaining data into the queue for writing later. */\n          if (n >= 0 && !enif_ioq_enqv(q, iovec, n))\n              return -3;\n      } else {\n          /* Dequeue any data that was written from the queue. */\n          if (n > 0 && !enif_ioq_deq(q, n, NULL))\n              return -4;\n      }\n\n      /* return n, which is either number of bytes written or -1 if\n         some error happened */\n      errno = saved_errno;\n      return n;\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Long-running NIFs**{: #lengthy_work }  \n  As mentioned in the [warning](erl_nif.md#WARNING) text at the beginning of\n  this manual page, it is of _vital importance_ that a native function returns\n  relatively fast. It is difficult to give an exact maximum amount of time that\n  a native function is allowed to work, but usually a well-behaving native\n  function is to return to its caller within 1 millisecond. This can be achieved\n  using different approaches. If you have full control over the code to execute\n  in the native function, the best approach is to divide the work into multiple\n  chunks of work and call the native function multiple times. This is, however,\n  not always possible, for example when calling third-party libraries.\n\n  The [`enif_consume_timeslice()`](erl_nif.md#enif_consume_timeslice) function\n  can be used to inform the runtime system about the length of the NIF call. It\n  is typically always to be used unless the NIF executes very fast.\n\n  If the NIF call is too lengthy, this must be handled in one of the following\n  ways to avoid degraded responsiveness, scheduler load balancing problems, and\n  other strange behaviors:\n\n  - **Yielding NIF** - If the functionality of a long-running NIF can be split\n    so that its work can be achieved through a series of shorter NIF calls, the\n    application has two options:\n\n    - Make that series of NIF calls from the Erlang level.\n    - Call a NIF that first performs a chunk of the work, then invokes the\n      [`enif_schedule_nif`](erl_nif.md#enif_schedule_nif) function to schedule\n      another NIF call to perform the next chunk. The final call scheduled in\n      this manner can then return the overall result.\n\n    Breaking up a long-running function in this manner enables the VM to regain\n    control between calls to the NIFs.\n\n    This approach is always preferred over the other alternatives described\n    below. This both from a performance perspective and a system characteristics\n    perspective.\n\n  - **Threaded NIF** - This is accomplished by dispatching the work to another\n    thread managed by the NIF library, return from the NIF, and wait for the\n    result. The thread can send the result back to the Erlang process using\n    [`enif_send`](erl_nif.md#enif_send). Information about thread primitives is\n    provided below.\n\n  - **Dirty NIF**{: #dirty_nifs }  \n    A NIF that cannot be split and cannot execute in a millisecond or less is\n    called a \"dirty NIF\", as it performs work that the ordinary schedulers of\n    the Erlang runtime system cannot handle cleanly. Applications that make use\n    of such functions must indicate to the runtime that the functions are dirty\n    so they can be handled specially. This is handled by executing dirty jobs on\n    a separate set of schedulers called dirty schedulers. A dirty NIF executing\n    on a dirty scheduler does not have the same duration restriction as a normal\n    NIF.\n\n    It is important to classify the dirty job correct. An I/O bound job should\n    be classified as such, and a CPU bound job should be classified as such. If\n    you should classify CPU bound jobs as I/O bound jobs, dirty I/O schedulers\n    might starve ordinary schedulers. I/O bound jobs are expected to either\n    block waiting for I/O, and/or spend a limited amount of time moving data.\n\n    To schedule a dirty NIF for execution, the application has two options:\n\n    - Set the appropriate flags value for the dirty NIF in its\n      [`ErlNifFunc`](erl_nif.md#ErlNifFunc) entry.\n    - Call [`enif_schedule_nif`](erl_nif.md#enif_schedule_nif), pass to it a\n      pointer to the dirty NIF to be executed, and indicate with argument\n      `flags` whether it expects the operation to be CPU-bound or I/O-bound.\n\n    A job that alternates between I/O bound and CPU bound can be reclassified\n    and rescheduled using `enif_schedule_nif` so that it executes on the correct\n    type of dirty scheduler at all times. For more information see the\n    documentation of the [erl](erl_cmd.md) command line arguments\n    [`+SDcpu`](erl_cmd.md#%2BSDcpu), and [`+SDio`](erl_cmd.md#%2BSDio).\n\n    While a process executes a dirty NIF, some operations that communicate with\n    it can take a very long time to complete. Suspend or garbage collection of a\n    process executing a dirty NIF cannot be done until the dirty NIF has\n    returned. Thus, other processes waiting for such operations to complete\n    might have to wait for a very long time. Blocking multi-scheduling, that is,\n    calling\n    [`erlang:system_flag(multi_scheduling, block)`](`m:erlang#system_flag_multi_scheduling`),\n    can also take a very long time to complete. This is because all ongoing\n    dirty operations on all dirty schedulers must complete before the block\n    operation can complete.\n\n    Many operations communicating with a process executing a dirty NIF can,\n    however, complete while it executes the dirty NIF. For example, retrieving\n    information about it through [`process_info`](`erlang:process_info/1`),\n    setting its group leader, register/unregister its name, and so on.\n\n    Termination of a process executing a dirty NIF can only be completed up to a\n    certain point while it executes the dirty NIF. All Erlang resources, such as\n    its registered name and its ETS tables, are released. All links and monitors\n    are triggered. The execution of the NIF is, however, _not_ stopped. The NIF\n    can safely continue execution, allocate heap memory, and so on, but it is of\n    course better to stop executing as soon as possible. The NIF can check\n    whether a current process is alive using\n    [`enif_is_current_process_alive`](erl_nif.md#enif_is_current_process_alive).\n    Communication using [`enif_send`](erl_nif.md#enif_send) and\n    [`enif_port_command`](erl_nif.md#enif_port_command) is also dropped when the\n    sending process is not alive. Deallocation of certain internal resources,\n    such as process heap and process control block, is delayed until the dirty\n    NIF has completed.","ref":"erl_nif.html#functionality"},{"type":"extras","title":"Initialization - erl_nif","doc":"- **`ERL_NIF_INIT(MODULE, ErlNifFunc funcs[], load, NULL, upgrade, unload)`**{: #ERL_NIF_INIT } -\n  This is the magic macro to initialize a NIF library.

Note that by _returning_ we here\n  mean the first point where the NIF returns control back to the runtime system,\n  and _not_ the point where a call to a NIF return a value back to the Erlang\n  code that called the NIF. That is, if you schedule execution of a NIF, using\n  [`enif_schedule_nif()`](erl_nif.md#enif_schedule_nif), from within a NIF while\n  the system is halting, the scheduled NIF call will _not_ be executed even\n  though _delay halt_ has been enabled for the NIF library.\n\n  The runtime system halts when one of the [`erlang:halt()`](`erlang:halt/0`)\n  BIFs are called. By default flushing is enabled, but can be disabled using the\n  `erlang:halt/2` BIF. When flushing has been disabled, the _delay halt_ setting\n  will have no effect. That is, the runtime system will halt without waiting for\n  NIFs to return even if the _delay halt_ setting has been enabled. See the\n  [`{flush, boolean()}`](`m:erlang#halt_flush`) option of `erlang:halt/2` for\n  more information.\n\n  The `ERL_NIF_OPT_DELAY_HALT` option can only be set during loading of a NIF\n  library in a call to `enif_set_option()` inside a NIF library\n  [`load()`](erl_nif.md#load) or [`upgrade()`](erl_nif.md#upgrade) call, and\n  will fail if set somewhere else.

That is, in case\n  both a new and old version of a module using the NIF library are loaded, they\n  can have the same or different _delay halt_ settings.\n\n  The _delay halt_ feature can be used in combination with an\n  [_on halt_](erl_nif.md#on_halt) callback. The _on halt_ callback is in this\n  case typically used to notify processes blocked in NIFs in the library that it\n  is time to return in order to let the runtime system complete the halting.\n  Such NIFs should be dirty NIFs, since ordinary NIFs should never block for a\n  long time.\n\n- **[`ERL_NIF_OPT_ON_HALT`](erl_nif.md#ErlNifOption)**{: #on_halt }\n  ```c\n  enif_set_option(env, ERL_NIF_OPT_ON_HALT, on_halt)\n  ```\n\n  Install a callback that will be called when the runtime system halts with\n  flushing enabled.\n\n  The runtime system halts when one of the [`erlang:halt()`](`erlang:halt/0`)\n  BIFs are called.

A carrier is either placed in a separate memory segment (allocated\nthrough `mseg_alloc`), or in the heap segment (allocated through `sys_alloc`).\n\n- Multiblock carriers are used for storage of several blocks.\n- Singleblock carriers are used for storage of one block.\n- Blocks that are larger than the value of the singleblock carrier threshold\n  ([`sbct`](erts_alloc.md#M_sbct)) parameter are placed in singleblock carriers.\n- Blocks that are smaller than the value of parameter `sbct` are placed in\n  multiblock carriers.\n\nNormally an allocator creates a \"main multiblock carrier\". Main multiblock\ncarriers are never deallocated. The size of the main multiblock carrier is\ndetermined by the value of parameter [`mmbcs`](erts_alloc.md#M_mmbcs).\n\n[](){: #mseg_mbc_sizes } Sizes of multiblock carriers allocated through\n`mseg_alloc` are decided based on the following parameters:\n\n- The values of the largest multiblock carrier size\n  ([`lmbcs`](erts_alloc.md#M_lmbcs))\n- The smallest multiblock carrier size ([`smbcs`](erts_alloc.md#M_smbcs))\n- The multiblock carrier growth stages ([`mbcgs`](erts_alloc.md#M_mbcgs))\n\nIf `nc` is the current number of multiblock carriers (the main multiblock\ncarrier excluded) managed by an allocator, the size of the next `mseg_alloc`\nmultiblock carrier allocated by this allocator is roughly\n`smbcs+nc*(lmbcs-smbcs)/mbcgs` when `nc <= mbcgs`, and `lmbcs` when\n`nc > mbcgs`. If the value of parameter `sbct` is larger than the value of\nparameter `lmbcs`, the allocator may have to create multiblock carriers that are\nlarger than the value of parameter `lmbcs`, though. Singleblock carriers\nallocated through `mseg_alloc` are sized to whole pages.\n\nSizes of carriers allocated through `sys_alloc` are decided based on the value\nof the `sys_alloc` carrier size ([`ycs`](erts_alloc.md#Muycs)) parameter. The\nsize of a carrier is the least number of multiples of the value of parameter\n`ycs` satisfying the request.\n\nCoalescing of free blocks are always performed immediately. Boundary tags\n(headers and footers) in free blocks are used, which makes the time complexity\nfor coalescing constant.\n\n[](){: #strategy } The memory allocation strategy used for multiblock carriers\nby an allocator can be configured using parameter [`as`](erts_alloc.md#M_as).\nThe following strategies are available:\n\n- **Best fit** - Strategy: Find the smallest block satisfying the requested\n  block size.\n\n  Implementation: A balanced binary search tree is used. The time complexity is\n  proportional to log N, where N is the number of sizes of free blocks.\n\n- **Address order best fit** - Strategy: Find the smallest block satisfying the\n  requested block size.

The time complexity is\n  proportional to log N, where N is the number of free blocks.\n\n- **Good fit** - Strategy: Try to find the best fit, but settle for the best fit\n  found during a limited search.\n\n  Implementation: The implementation uses segregated free lists with a maximum\n  block search depth (in each list) to find a good fit fast. When the maximum\n  block search depth is small (by default 3), this implementation has a time\n  complexity that is constant. The maximum block search depth can be configured\n  using parameter [`mbsd`](erts_alloc.md#M_mbsd).\n\n- **A fit** - Strategy: Do not search for a fit, inspect only one free block to\n  see if it satisfies the request. This strategy is only intended to be used for\n  temporary allocations.\n\n  Implementation: Inspect the first block in a free-list. If it satisfies the\n  request, it is used, otherwise a new carrier is created. The implementation\n  has a time complexity that is constant.\n\n  As from ERTS 5.6.1 the emulator refuses to use this strategy on other\n  allocators than `temp_alloc`. This because it only causes problems for other\n  allocators.\n\nApart from the ordinary allocators described above, some pre-allocators are used\nfor some specific data types. These pre-allocators pre-allocate a fixed amount\nof memory for certain data types when the runtime system starts. As long as\npre-allocated memory is available, it is used. When no pre-allocated memory is\navailable, memory is allocated in ordinary allocators.

The Erlang/OTP system gets\nunresponsive, and some task may get prioritized unfairly if NIFs and\nBIFs occupy scheduler threads for a too long time. Therefore, the most\ncommonly used NIFs and BIFs that may run for a long time can yield.\n\nProblems\n--------\n\nErlang NIFs and BIFs are typically implemented in the C programming\nlanguage. The C programming language does not have built-in support\nfor automatic yielding in the middle of a routine (referred to as\n[coroutine support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine) in other\nprogramming languages). Therefore, most NIFs and BIFs implement\nyielding manually. Manual implementation of yielding has the advantage\nof giving the programmer control over what should be saved and when\nyielding should happen. Unfortunately, manual implementation of\nyielding also leads to code with a lot of boilerplate that is more\ndifficult to read than corresponding code that does not\nyield. Furthermore, manual implementation of yielding can be\ntime-consuming and error-prone, especially if the NIF or BIF is\ncomplicated.\n\nSolution\n--------\n\nA source-to-source transformer, called Yielding C Fun (YCF), has been\ncreated to make it easier to implement yielding NIFs and BIFs. YCF is\na tool that takes a set of function names and a C source code file and\ntransforms the functions with the given names in the source code file\ninto yieldable versions that can be used as coroutines. YCF has been\ncreated with yielding NIFs and BIFs in mind and has several features\nthat can be handy when implementing yielding NIFs and BIFs. The reader\nis recommended to look at YCF's documentation for a detailed\ndescription of YCF.\n\nYielding C Fun's Source Code and Documentation\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThe source code of YCF is included in the folder\n`\"$ERL_TOP\"/erts/lib_src/yielding_c_fun/` inside the source tree of\nthe Erlang/OTP system. The documentation of YCF can be found in\n`\"$ERL_TOP\"/erts/lib_src/yielding_c_fun/README.md`. A rendered version\nof YCF documentation can be found\n[here](https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/master/erts/lib_src/yielding_c_fun/README.md).\n\nYielding C Fun in the Erlang Run-time System\n-------------------------------------------\n\nAt the time of writing, YCF is used for the following in ERTS:\n\n* `ets:insert/2` and`ets:insert_new/2` (when these two functions get a list as their second parameter)\n* `maps:from_keys/2`, `maps:from_list/1`, `maps:keys/1` and `maps:values/1`\n* The functions `erts_qsort_ycf_gen_yielding`,\n  `erts_qsort_ycf_gen_continue` and `erts_qsort_ycf_gen_destroy`\n  implements a general purpose yieldable sorting routine that is used\n  in the implementation of `erlang:term_to_binary/2`\n\nBest Practices for YCF in the ERTS\n-------------------------------------------\n\nFirst of all, before starting to use YCF it is recommended to read\nthrough its documentation in\n[erts/lib_src/yielding_c_fun/README.md](https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/master/erts/lib_src/yielding_c_fun/README.md)\nto understand what limitations and functionalities YCF has.","ref":"automaticyieldingofccode.html"},{"type":"extras","title":"Mark YCF Transformed Functions - Automatic Yielding of C Code","doc":"It is important that it is easy to see what functions are transformed\nby YCF so that a programmer that edits these function are aware that\nthey have to follow certain restrictions.

With YCF this can\nbe accomplished by passing a pointer to the value 1 as the\n`ycf_nr_of_reductions` parameter (i.e., the first parameter of the\n`*_ycf_gen_yielding` and `*_ycf_gen_continue` functions).\n\nThe YCF flag `-debug` makes YCF generate code that checks for pointers\nto the C stack when yielding. When such a pointer is found the\nlocation of the found pointer will be printed out and the program will\ncrash. This can save a lot (!) of time when porting already existing C\ncode to yield with YCF. To make the `-debug` option work as intended,\none has to tell YCF where the stack starts before calling the YCF\ngenerated function. The functions `ycf_debug_set_stack_start` and\n`ycf_debug_reset_stack_start` has been created to make this easier\n(see the implementation of `erts_ycf_trap_driver` for how to use these\nfunctions). It is recommended to set up building of ERTS so that debug\nbuilds of ERTS runs with YCF code generated with the `-debug` flag\nwhile production code runs with YCF code that has been generated\nwithout the `-debug` flag.\n\nIt is a good practice to look through the code generated by YCF to try\nto find things that are not correctly transformed. Before doing that\none should format the generated code with an automatic source code\nformatter (the generated code is quite unreadable otherwise). If YCF\ndoes not transform something correctly, it is almost certainly possible\nto fix that by rewriting the code (see the YCF documentation for what\nis supported and what is not supported). For example, if you have a\ninline struct variable declaration (for example,\n`struct {int field1; int field2;} mystructvar;`), YCF will not recognize this\nas a variable declaration but you can fix this by creating a `typedef`\nfor the struct.\n\nYCF's hooks can be useful when debugging code that has been transformed\nby YCF. For examples, the hooks can be used to print the value of a\nvariable when yielding and when resuming after yielding.\n\nUnfortunately, YCF does not handle C code with syntactical errors very\nwell and can crash or produce bad output without giving any useful\nerror message when given syntactically incorrect C code (for example,\na missing parenthesis). Therefore, it is recommended to always check\nthe code with a normal C compiler before transforming it with YCF.","ref":"automaticyieldingofccode.html#testing-and-finding-problems-in-ycf-generated-code"},{"type":"extras","title":"Common Pitfalls - Automatic Yielding of C Code","doc":"* **Pointers to the stack** The stack might be located somewhere else\n  when a yielded function continues to execute so pointers to\n  variables that are located on the stack can be a problem.

YCF has functionality to make it easier to\n  port code that has pointers to the stack (see the documentation of\n  `YCF_STACK_ALLOC` in the YCF documentation for more\n  information). Another way to fix pointers to the stack, that\n  sometimes can be convenient, is to use YCF's hooks to set up\n  pointers to the stack correctly when a yielded function resumes.\n\n* **Macros** YCF does not expand macros so variable declarations,\n  return statements, and gotos etc that are \"hidden\" by macros can be\n  a problem.

This can be done, e.g., by calling the generated\n  `*_ycf_gen_destroy` function from the `dtor` of a magic binary that\n  holds a reference to trap state. YCF's `ON_DESTROY_STATE` and\n  `ON_DESTROY_STATE_OR_RETURN` hooks can be used to free any resources\n  that has been manually allocated inside a yielding function when the\n  function's `*_ycf_gen_destroy` function is executed.

Exceptions must not be thrown when the return address is reserved.\n\n    It's hard to tell where the stack will end up after an exception; the return\n    address won't be on the stack if we crash in the _current stack frame_, but\n    will be if we crash in a function we call. Telling these apart turned out to\n    rather complicated, so we decided to require the return address to be used\n    when an exception is thrown.\n\n    `emit_handle_error` handles this for you, and shared fragments that have been\n    called (rather than jumped to) satisfy this requirement by default.\n\n2. Garbage collection needs to take return addresses into account.\n\n    If we're about to create a term we have to make sure that there's enough\n    space for this term _and_ a potential return address, or else the next\n    `call` will clobber said term. This is taken care of in `emit_gc_test` and\n    you generally don't need to think about it.\n\nIn addition to the above, we ensure that there's always at least `S_REDZONE`\nfree words on the stack so we can make calls to shared fragments or trace\nhandlers even when we lack a stack frame.

We call these chunks of raw memory\n*carriers*. Single-block carriers which only contain one large block,\nand multi-block carriers which contain multiple blocks. A carrier is\ntypically created using `mmap()` on unix systems. However, how a\ncarrier is created is of minor importance. An allocator instance\ntypically manages a mixture of single- and multi-block carriers.\n\nProblem\n-------\n\nWhen a carrier is empty, i.e. contains only one large free block, it\nis deallocated. Since multi-block carriers can contain both allocated\nblocks and free blocks at the same time, an allocator instance might\nbe stuck with a large amount of poorly utilized carriers if the memory\nload decreases. After a peak in memory usage it is expected that not\nall memory can be returned since the blocks still allocated are likely\nto be dispersed over multiple carriers. Such poorly utilized carriers\ncan usually be reused if the memory load increases again. However,\nsince each scheduler thread manages its own set of allocator\ninstances, and memory load is not necessarily correlated to CPU load, we\nmight get into a situation where there are lots of poorly utilized\nmulti-block carriers on some allocator instances while we need to\nallocate new multi-block carriers on other allocator instances. In\nscenarios like this, the demand for multi-block carriers in the system\nmight increase at the same time as the actual memory demand in the\nsystem has decreased which is both unwanted and quite unexpected for\nthe end user.\n\nSolution\n--------\n\nIn order to prevent scenarios like this we've implemented support for\nmigration of multi-block carriers between allocator instances.","ref":"carriermigration.html"},{"type":"extras","title":"Management of Free Blocks ### - Carrier Migration","doc":"In order to be able to remove a carrier from one allocator instance\nand add it to another we need to be able to move references to the\nfree blocks of the carrier between the allocator instances. The\nallocator instance specific data structure referring to the free\nblocks it manages often refers to the same carrier from multiple\nplaces. For example, when the address order best-fit strategy is used\nthis data structure is a binary search tree spanning all carriers that\nthe allocator instance manages. Free blocks in one specific carrier\ncan be referred to from potentially every other carrier that is\nmanaged, and the amount of such references can be huge. That is, the\nwork of removing the free blocks of such a carrier from the search\ntree will be huge. One way of solving this could be not to migrate\ncarriers that contain lots of free blocks, but this would prevent us\nfrom migrating carriers that potentially need to be migrated in order\nto solve the problem we set out to solve.\n\nBy using one data structure of free blocks in each carrier and an\nallocator instance-wide data structure of carriers managed by the\nallocator instance, the work needed in order to remove and add\ncarriers can be kept to a minimum. When migration of carriers is\nenabled on a specific allocator type, we require that an allocation\nstrategy with such an implementation is used. Currently we've\nimplemented this for three different allocation strategies. All of\nthese strategies use a search tree of carriers sorted so that we can\nfind the carrier with the lowest address that can satisfy the\nrequest. Internally in carriers we use yet another search tree that\neither implement address order first fit, address order best fit,\nor best fit. The abbreviations used for these different allocation\nstrategies are `aoff`, and `aoffcaobf`, `aoffcbf`.","ref":"carriermigration.html#management-of-free-blocks"},{"type":"extras","title":"Carrier Pool ### - Carrier Migration","doc":"In order to migrate carriers between allocator instances we move them\nthrough a pool of carriers. In order for a carrier migration to\ncomplete, one scheduler needs to move the carrier into the pool, and\nanother scheduler needs to take the carrier out of the pool.\n\nThe pool is implemented as a lock-free, circular, double linked,\nlist. The list contains a sentinel which is used as the starting point\nwhen inserting to, or fetching from, the pool. Carriers in the pool are\nelements in this list.\n\nThe list can be modified by all scheduler threads\nsimultaneously. During modifications the double linked list is allowed\nto get a bit \"out of shape\". For example, following the `next` pointer\nto the next element and then following the `prev` pointer does not\nalways take you back to were you started. The following is however\nalways true:\n\n*   Repeatedly following `next` pointers will eventually take you to the\n    sentinel.\n*   Repeatedly following `prev` pointers will eventually take you to the\n    sentinel.\n*   Following a `next` or a `prev` pointer will take you to either an\n    element in the pool, or an element that used to be in the pool.\n\nWhen inserting a new element we search for a place to insert the\nelement by only following `next` pointers, and we always begin by\nskipping the first element encountered. When trying to fetch an\nelement we do the same thing, but instead only follow `prev` pointers.\n\nBy going different directions when inserting and fetching, we avoid\ncontention between threads inserting and threads fetching as much as\npossible. By skipping one element when we begin searching, we preserve\nthe sentinel unmodified as much as possible. This is beneficial since\nall search operations need to read the content of the sentinel. If we\nwere to modify the sentinel, the cache line containing the sentinel\nwould unnecessarily be bounced between processors.\n\nThe `prev` and `next` fields in the elements of the list contain the\nvalue of the pointer, a modification marker, and a deleted\nmarker. Memory operations on these fields are done using atomic memory\noperations. When a thread has set the modification marker in a field,\nno-one except the thread that set the marker is allowed to modify the\nfield. If multiple modification markers need to be set, we always\nbegin with `next` fields followed by `prev` fields in the order\nfollowing the actual pointers. This guarantees that no deadlocks will\noccur.\n\nWhen a carrier is being removed from a pool, we mark it with a thread\nprogress value that needs to be reached before we are allowed to\nmodify the `next` and `prev` fields.

This might not be a big problem for\ninitial loading of modules during VM boot, but it can be a severe\nproblem for availability when upgrading modules or adding new code on\na VM with running payload. This problem grows with the number of cores\nas both the time it takes to wait for all schedulers to stop increases\nas well as the potential amount of halted ongoing work.\n\nIn OTP R16, modules are loaded without blocking the VM.\nErlang processes may continue executing undisturbed in parallel during\nthe entire load operation. The code loading is carried out by a normal\nErlang process that is scheduled like all the others. The load\noperation is completed by making the loaded code visible to all\nprocesses in a consistent way with one single atomic\ninstruction. Non-blocking code loading will improve real-time\ncharacteristics when modules are loaded/upgraded on a running SMP\nsystem.\n\n\nThe Load Phases\n---------------\n\nThe loading of a module is divided into two phases; a *prepare phase*\nand a *finishing phase*. The prepare phase contains reading the BEAM\nfile format and all the preparations of the loaded code that can\neasily be done without interference with the running code. The\nfinishing phase will make the loaded (and prepared) code accessible\nfrom the running code. Old module versions (replaced or deleted) will\nalso be made inaccessible by the finishing phase.\n\nThe prepare phase is designed to allow several \"loader\" processes to\nprepare separate modules in parallel while the finishing phase can\nonly be done by one loader process at a time. A second loader process\ntrying to enter finishing phase will be suspended until the first\nloader is done. This will only block the process, the scheduler is\nfree to schedule other work while the second loader is waiting. (See\n`erts_try_seize_code_load_permission` and\n`erts_release_code_load_permission`).\n\nThe ability to prepare several modules in parallel is not currently\nused as almost all code loading is serialized by the code\\_server\nprocess. The BIF interface is however prepared for this.\n\n      erlang:prepare_loading(Module, Code) -> LoaderState\n      erlang:finish_loading([LoaderState])\n\nThe idea is that `prepare_loading` could be called in parallel for\ndifferent modules and returns a \"magic binary\" containing the internal\nstate of each prepared module. Function `finish_loading` could take a\nlist of such states and do the finishing of all of them in one go.\n\nCurrently we use the legacy BIF `erlang:load_module` which is now\nimplemented in Erlang by calling the above two functions in\nsequence. Function `finish_loading` is limited to only accepts a list\nwith one module state as we do not yet use the multi module loading\nfeature.\n\n\nThe Finishing Sequence\n----------------------\n\nDuring VM execution, code is accessed through a number of data\nstructures. These *code access structures* are\n\n* Export table. One entry for every exported function.\n* Module table. One entry for each loaded module.\n* \"beam\\_catches\". Identifies jump destinations for catch instructions.\n* \"beam\\_ranges\". Map code address to function and line in source file.\n\nThe most frequently used of these structures is the export table that\nis accessed in run time for every executed external function call to\nget the address of the callee. For performance reasons, we want to\naccess all these structures without any overhead from thread\nsynchronization. Earlier this was solved with an emergency break. Stop\nthe entire VM to mutate these code access structures, otherwise treat\nthem as read-only.\n\nThe solution in R16 is instead to *replicate* the code access\nstructures. We have one set of active structures read by the running\ncode. When new code is loaded the active structures are copied, the\ncopy is updated to include the newly loaded module and then a switch\nis made to make the updated copy the new active set. The active set is\nidentified by a single global atomic variable\n`the_active_code_index`. The switch can thus be made by a single\natomic write operation. The running code have to read this atomic\nvariable when using the active access structures, which means one\natomic read operation per external function call for example. The\nperformance penalty from this extra atomic read is however very small\nas it can be done without any memory barriers at all (as described\nbelow). With this solution we also preserve the transactional feature\nof a load operation. Running code will never see the intermediate\nresult of a half loaded module.\n\nThe finishing phase is carried out in the following sequence by the\nBIF `erlang:finish_loading`:\n\n1. Seize exclusive code load permission (suspend process if needed\n   until we get it).\n\n2. Make a full copy of all the active access structures. This copy is\n   called the staging area and is identified by the global atomic\n   variable `the_staging_code_index`.\n\n3. Update all access structures in the staging area to include the\n   newly prepared module.\n\n4. Schedule a thread progress event. That is a time in the future when\n   all schedulers have yielded and executed a full memory barrier.\n\n5. Suspend the loader process.\n\n6. After thread progress, commit the staging area by assigning\n   `the_staging_code_index` to `the_active_code_index`.\n\n7. Release the code load permission allowing other processes to stage\n   new code.\n\n8. Resume the loader process allowing it to return from\n   `erlang:finish_loading`.","ref":"codeloading.html"},{"type":"extras","title":"Thread Progress - Non-blocking code loading","doc":"The waiting for thread progress in 4-6 is necessary in order for\nprocesses to read `the_active_code_index` atomic during normal\nexecution without any expensive memory barriers.

Different processes may see\nthe new code at different point in time depending on when different\ncores happen to refresh their hardware caches. This may sound unsafe\nbut it actually does not matter. The only property we must guarantee\nis that the ability to see the new code must spread with process\ncommunication. After receiving a message that was triggered by new\ncode, the receiver must be guaranteed to also see the new code. This\nwill be guaranteed as all types of process communication involves\nmemory barriers in order for the receiver to be sure to read what the\nsender has written.

This solution of course scales\nvery poorly, due to heavy lock contention. An improved solution of\nthis scheme is to use multiple thread specific instances of such an\nallocator. That is, each thread allocates in its own allocator\ninstance which is protected by a lock. In the general case references\nto memory need to be passed between threads. In the case where a\nthread that needs to deallocate memory that originates from another\nthreads allocator instance a lock conflict is possible. In a system as\nthe Erlang VM where memory allocation/deallocation is frequent and\nreferences to memory also are passed around between threads this\nsolution will also scale poorly due to lock contention.\n\nFunctionality Used to Address This problem\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIn order to reduce contention due to locking of allocator instances we\nintroduced completely lock free instances tied to each scheduler\nthread, and an extra locked instance for other threads. The scheduler\nthreads in the system is expected to do the major part of the\nwork. Other threads may still be needed but should not perform any\nmajor and/or time critical work. The limited amount of contention that\nappears on the locked allocator instance can more or less be\ndisregarded.\n\nSince we still need to be able to pass references to memory between\nscheduler threads we need some way to manage this. An allocator\ninstance belonging to one scheduler thread is only allowed to be\nmanipulated by that scheduler thread. When other threads need to\ndeallocate memory originating from a foreign allocator instance, they\nonly pass the memory block to a \"message box\" containing deallocation\njobs attached to the originating allocator instance. When a scheduler\nthread detects such deallocation job it performs the actual\ndeallocation.\n\nThe \"message box\" is implemented using a lock free single linked list\nthrough the memory blocks to deallocate. The order of the elements in\nthis list is not important. Insertion of new free blocks will be made\nsomewhere near the end of this list. Requiring that the new blocks\nneed to be inserted at the end would cause unnecessary contention when\nlarge amount of memory blocks are inserted simultaneous by multiple\nthreads.\n\nThe data structure referring to this single linked list cover two cache\nlines. One cache line containing information about the head of the\nlist, and one cache line containing information about the tail of the\nlist. This in order to reduce cache line ping ponging of this data\nstructure. The head of the list will only be manipulated by the thread\nowning the allocator instance, and the tail will be manipulated by\nother threads inserting deallocation jobs.","ref":"delayeddealloc.html"},{"type":"extras","title":"Tail ### - Delayed Dealloc","doc":"In the tail part of the data structure we find a pointer to the last\nelement of the list, or at least something that is near the end of the\nlist.

This is done using an atomic compare and swap that expects\nthe next pointer to be `NULL`. If this succeeds the thread performing\nthis operation moves the last pointer to point to the newly inserted\nelement.\n\nIf the atomic compare and swap described above failed, the last\npointer didn't point to the last element. In this case we need to\ninsert the new element somewhere between the element that the last\npointer pointed to and the actual last element. If we do it this way\nthe last pointer will eventually end up at the last element when\nthreads stop adding new elements. When trying to insert somewhere near\nthe end and failing to do so, the inserting thread sometimes moves to\nthe next element and sometimes tries with the same element again.

When these two pointers are not\nequal the thread owning the allocator instance deallocate block after\nblock until `head.first` reach `head.unref_end`.\n\nWe of course periodically need to move the `head.unref_end` closer to\nthe end in order to be able to continue deallocating memory\nblocks. Since all threads inserting new elements in the linked list\nwill enter the list using the last pointer we can use this\nknowledge. If we call `erts_thr_progress_later()` and wait until we\nhave reached that thread progress we know that no managed threads can\nrefer the elements up to the element pointed to by the last pointer at\nthe time when we called `erts_thr_progress_later()`. This since, all\nmanaged threads must have left the code implementing this at least\nonce, and they always enters into the list via the last pointer.

Cons cells always require two words. Adding these things together, we get seven words for the tuples and 26 words for the cons cells. The string `\"hello world!\"` is a list of cons cells and thus requires 24 words. The atom `tag` and the integer `42` do not require any additional heap memory since it is an *immediate*. Adding all the terms together, the heap space required in this example should be 33 words.\n\nCompiling this code to beam assembly (`erlc -S`) shows exactly what is happening.\n\n    ...\n    {test_heap,6,1}.\n    {put_list,{integer,42},{x,0},{x,1}}.\n    {put_tuple,3,{x,0}}.\n    {put,{atom,tag}}.\n    {put,{x,1}}.\n    {put,{literal,{text,\"hello world!\"}}}.\n    return.\n\nLooking at the assembler code we can see three things: The heap requirement in this function turns out to be only six words, as seen by the `{test_heap,6,1}` instruction. All the allocations are combined to a single instruction. The bulk of the data `{text, \"hello world!\"}` is a *literal*. Literals, sometimes referred to as constants, are not allocated in the function since they are a part of the module and allocated at load time.\n\nIf there is not enough space available on the heap to satisfy the `test_heap` instructions request for memory, then a garbage collection is initiated. It may happen immediately in the `test_heap` instruction, or it can be delayed until a later time depending on what state the process is in. If the garbage collection is delayed, any memory needed will be allocated in heap fragments. Heap fragments are extra memory blocks that are a part of the young heap, but are not allocated in the contiguous area where terms normally reside.

When scanning, the collector steps through each term on the *to space* and any term still referencing the *from space* is copied over to the *to space*. Some terms contain non-term data (the payload of a on heap binary for instance). When encountered by the collector, these values are simply skipped.\n\n![Garbage collection: heap scan](assets/gc-heap-scan1.png)\n\nEvery term object we can reach is copied to the *to space* and stored on top off the *scan stop* line, and then the scan stop is moved to the end of the last object.\n\n![Garbage collection: heap scan](assets/gc-heap-stop.png)\n\nWhen *scan stop* marker [catches up](https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/OTP-18.0/erts/emulator/beam/erl_gc.c#L1103) to the *scan start* marker, the garbage collection is done.

An additional heap, called the old heap, is used where the long lived data is stored. The original heap is called the young heap, or sometimes the allocation heap.\n\nWith this in mind we can look at the Erlang's garbage collection again. During the copy stage anything that should be copied to the young *to space* is instead copied to the old *to space* *if* it is [below the *high-watermark*](https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/OTP-18.0/erts/emulator/beam/erl_gc.c#L1127).\n\n![Garbage collection: heap scan](assets/gc-watermark.png)\n\nThe [*high-watermark*](https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/OTP-18.0/erts/emulator/beam/erl_process.h#L1021) is placed where the previous garbage collection (described in [Overview](#overview)) ended and we have introduced a new area called the old heap. When doing the normal garbage collection pass, any term that is located below the high-watermark is copied to the old *to space* instead of the young.\n\n![Garbage collection: heap scan](assets/gc-watermark-2.png)\n\nIn the next garbage collection, any pointers to the old heap will be ignored and not scanned. This way the garbage collector does not have to scan the long-lived terms.\n\nGenerational garbage collection aims to increase performance at the expense of memory. This is achieved because only the young, smaller, heap is considered in most garbage collections.\n\nThe generational hypothesis predicts that most terms tend to die young (see D. Ungar in [References](#references)), and for an immutable language such as Erlang, young terms die even faster than in other languages. So for most usage patterns the data in the new heap will die very soon after it is allocated. This is good because it limits the amount of data copied to the old heap and also because the garbage collection algorithm used is proportional to the amount of live data on the heap.\n\nOne critical issue to note here is that any term on the young heap can reference terms on the old heap but *no* term on the old heap may refer to a term on the young heap. This is due to the nature of the copy algorithm. Anything referenced by an old heap term is not included in the reference tree, root-set and its followers, and hence is not copied. If it was, the data would be lost, fire and brimstone would rise to cover the earth. Fortunately, this comes naturally for Erlang because the terms are immutable and thus there can be no pointers modified on the old heap to point to the young heap.\n\nTo reclaim data from the old heap, both young and old heaps are included during the collection and copied to a common *to space*. Both the *from space* of the young and old heap are then deallocated and the procedure will start over from the beginning. This type of garbage collection is called a full sweep and is triggered when the size of the area under the high-watermark is larger than the size of the free area of the old heap. It can also be triggered by doing a manual call to [erlang:garbage_collect()](http://erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#garbage_collect-0), or by running into the young garbage collection limit set by [spawn\\_opt(fun(),[{fullsweep\\_after, N}\\])](http://erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#spawn_opt-4) where N is the number of young garbage collections to do before forcing a garbage collection of both young and old heap.","ref":"garbagecollection.html#generational-garbage-collection"},{"type":"extras","title":"The young heap - Erlang Garbage Collector","doc":"The young heap, or the allocation heap, consists of the stack and heap as described in the Overview.

Heap fragments contain terms that either did not fit on the heap, or were created by another process and then attached to the heap. For instance if the bif `binary_to_term/1` created a term which does not fit on the current heap without doing a garbage collection, it will create a heap-fragment for the term and then schedule a garbage collection for later. Also if a message is sent to the process, the payload may be placed in a heap-fragment and that fragment is added to young heap when the message is matched in a receive clause.\n\nThis procedure differs from how it worked prior to Erlang/OTP 19.0. Before 19.0, only a contiguous memory block where the young heap and stack resided was considered to be part of the young heap.

This system relies on the fact that a memory page that has not been touched yet does not take any actual space. So even if 1 GB of virtual memory is mapped, only the memory which is actually needed for literals is allocated in ram. The size of the literal area is configurable through the +MIscs erts\\_alloc option.\n\nOn 32 bit systems, there is not enough virtual memory space to allocate 1 GB for just literals, so instead small 256 KB sized literal regions are created on demand and a card mark bit-array of the entire 32 bit memory space is then used to determine if a term is a literal or not. Since the total memory space is only 32 bits, the card mark bit-array is only 256 words large. On a 64 bit system the same bit-array would have to be 1 tera words large, so this technique is only viable on 32 bit systems. Doing [lookups in the array](https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/OTP-19.0/erts/emulator/beam/erl_alloc.h#L316-L319) is a little more expensive then just doing the pointer checks that can be done in 64 bit systems, but not extremely so.\n\nOn 64 bit windows, on which erts\\_alloc cannot do unreserved virtual memory mappings, a [special tag](https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/OTP-19.0/erts/emulator/beam/erl_term.h#L59) within the Erlang term object is used to determine if something [is a literal or not](https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/OTP-19.0/erts/emulator/beam/erl_term.h#L248-L252). This is very cheap, however, the tag is only available on 64 bit machines, and it is possible to do a great deal of other nice optimizations with this tag in the future (like for instance a more compact list implementation) so it is not used on operating systems where it is not needed.\n\nThis behaviour is different from how it worked prior to Erlang/OTP 19.0. Before 19.0 the literal check was done by checking if the pointer pointed to the young or old heap block. If it did not, then it was considered a literal.

The possibility for a lock conflict is thus likely in an intensely collaborating system.\nIf the sending process cannot acquire the main lock, a heap fragment is instead created for the message and the message payload is copied onto that.\nWith the `off_heap` option the sender process always creates heap fragments for messages sent to that process.\n\nThere are a bunch of different tradeoffs that come into play when trying to figure out which of the strategies you want to use.\n\nUsing `off_heap` may seem like a nice way to get a more scalable system as you get very little contention on the main locks, however, allocating a heap fragment is more expensive than allocating on the heap of the receiving process. So if it is very unlikely that contention will occur, it is more efficient to try to allocate the message directly on the receiving process' heap.\n\nUsing `on_heap` will force all messages to be part of on the young heap which will increase the amount of data that the garbage collector has to move. So if a garbage collection is triggered while processing a large amount of messages, they will be copied to the young heap. This in turn will lead to that the messages will quickly be promoted to the old heap and thus increase its size. This may be good or bad depending on exactly what the process does. A large old heap means that the young heap will also be larger, which in turn means that less garbage collections will be triggered while processing the message queue. This will temporarily increase the throughput of the process at the cost of more memory usage. However, if after all the messages have been consumed the process enters a state where a lot less messages are being received. Then it may be a long time before the next fullsweep garbage collection happens and the messages that are on the old heap will be there until that happens. So while `on_heap` is potentially faster than the other modes, it uses more memory for a longer time. This mode is the legacy mode which is almost how the message queue was handled before Erlang/OTP 19.0.\n\nWhich one of these strategies is best depends a lot on what the process is doing and how it interacts with other processes.

The process structure contains miscellaneous\ninformation about a process, as for example pointers to its heap,\nmessage queue, etc. When the runtime system needs to operate on a\nprocess, it looks up the process structure in the process table using\nthe process identifier. An example of this is when passing a message\nto a process.\n\nThe process table has for a very long time just been an array of\npointers to process structures. Since process identifiers internally\nin the runtime system are 28-bit integers it is quite easy to map a\nprocess identifier to index into the array. The 28-bits were divided\ninto two sets. The least significant set of bits was used as index\ninto the array. The most significant set of bits was only used to be\nable to distinguish between a number of identifiers with which map to\nthe same index in the array. As long as process table sizes of a power\nof two was used we had 2^28 unique process identifiers.\n\nWhen the first SMP support was implemented, the table still was kept\nmore or less the same way, but protected by two types of locks. One\nlock that protected the whole table against modifications and an array\nof locks protecting different parts of the table. The exact locking\nstrategy previously used isn't interesting. What is interesting is\nthat it suffered from heavy lock contention especially when lots of\nmodifications was being made, but also when only performing lookups.\n\nIn order to be able to detect when it is safe to deallocate a\npreviously used process structure, reference counting of the structure\nwas used. Also this was problematic, since simultaneous lookups needed\nto modify the reference counter which also caused contention on the\ncache line where the reference counter was located. This since all\nmodifications needs to be communicated between all involved\nprocessors.\n\nThe port table is very similar to the process table. The major\ndifference, at least in concept, is that it is a mapping from port\nidentifiers to port structures. It had a similar implementation, but\nwith some differences. Instead of being an array of pointers it was an\narray of structures, and instead of being protected by two types of\nlocks it was only protected by one global lock. This table also\nsuffered from lock contention in various situations.\n\nSolution\n--------\n\nThe process table was the major problem to address since processes are\nmuch more frequently used than ports. The first implementation only\nimplemented this for processes, but since the port table is very\nsimilar and very similar problems occur on the port table, the process\ntable implementation was later generalized so that it could also be\nused implementing the port table. For simplicity I will only talk\nabout the process table in the following text, but the same will apply\nto the port table unless otherwise stated.\n\nIf we disregard the locking issues, the original solution is very\nappealing. The mapping from process identifier to index into the array\nis very fast, and this property is something we would like to\nkeep. The vast majority of operations on these tables are lookups so\noptimizing for lookups is what we want to do.","ref":"ptables.html"},{"type":"extras","title":"Lookup ### - Process and Port Tables","doc":"Using a set of bits in the process identifier as index into an array\nseems hard to beat.

Read the pointer using an atomic memory operation at determined\n    index in array.\n\n    On all platforms that we provide atomic memory operations, this is\n    just a `volatile` read, preventing the compiler to use values in\n    registers, forcing the a read from memory.\n\n3.  Depending on use, issue appropriate memory barrier.\n\n    A common barrier used is a barrier with acquire semantics. On\n    x86/x86\\_64 this maps to a compiler barrier preventing the compiler\n    to reorder instructions, but on other hardware often some kind of\n    light weight hardware memory barrier is also needed.\n\n    When comparing with a locked approach, at least one heavy weight\n    memory barrier will be issued when locking the lock on most, if\n    not all, hardware architectures (including x86/x86\\_64), and often\n    some kind of light weight memory barrier will be issued when\n    unlocking the lock. \n\nWhen looking at this very simple solution with very little overhead\nyou might wonder why we didn't implement it this way from the\nbeginning. It all boils down to the read operation of the pointer. We\nneed some way to know that it is safe to access the memory pointed\nto. One way of doing this is to place a reference counter in the\nprocess structure. Increment of the reference counter at lookup needs\nto be done atomically with the lookup.

If PidX is larger than PidY, then PidX was created after\nPidY assuming both identifiers originates from the same node. However,\nsince we have a quite limited amount of unique identifiers today\n(2^28), this property cannot be relied upon if we create large amount\nof processes. But never the less, this is a property the system always\nhave had.\n\nIf we would have had a huge amount of unique identifiers available, it\nwould have tempting to drop or modify this ordering property as\ndescribed above. The ordering property could for example be based on\nthe scheduler performing the spawn operation. It would have been\npossible to reserve large ranges of identifiers exclusive for each\nscheduler thread which could be used minimizing the need for\ncommunication when allocating identifiers. The amount of identifiers\nwe got to work with today is, however, not even close to be enough for\nsuch an approach.\n\nSince we have a limited amount of unique identifiers, we need to be\ncareful not to waste them. If previously used identifiers are reused\ntoo quick, identifiers originating from terminated processes will\nrefer to newly created processes, and mixups will occur. The\npreviously used approach was quite good at not wasting\nidentifiers. Using a modified version of the same approach also lets\nus keep the ordering property that we have always had.\n\n#### Insert ####\n\nThe original approach is more or less to search for next free index or\nslot in the array. The search starts from the last slot allocated. If\nwe reach the end of the array we increase a \"wrapped counter\" and then\ncontinue the search. The process identifier is constructed by writing\nthe index to the least significant set of bits, and the \"wrapped\ncounter\" to the most significant set of bits. The amount of bits in\neach set of bits is decided at boot time, so that maximum index will\njust fit into the least significant set of bits.\n\nIn the modified lock free version of this approach we more or less do\nit the same way, but with some important modifications trying to avoid\nunnecessary contention when multiple schedulers create processes\nsimultaneously. Since multiple threads might be trying to search for\nthe next free slot at the same time from the same starting point we\nwant subsequent slots to be located in different cache lines. Multiple\nschedulers simultaneously writing new pointers into the table are\ntherefore very likely to write into adjacent slots. If adjacent slots\nare located in the same cache line all modification of this cache line\nneeds to be communicated between all involved processors which will be\nvery expensive and scale very poor. By locating adjacent slots in\ndifferent cache lines only true conflicts will trigger communication\nbetween involved processors, i.e., avoiding false sharing.\n\nA cache line is larger than a pointer, typically 8 or 16 times larger,\nso using one cache line for each slot only containing one pointer\nwould be a waste of space. Each cache line will be able to hold a\nfixed amount of slots. The first slot of the table will be the first\nslot of the first cache line, the second slot of the table will be the\nfirst slot of the second cache line until we reach the end of the\narray. The next slot after that will be the second slot of the first\ncache line, etc, moving forward one cache line internal slot each time\nwe wrap. This way we will be able to fit the same amount of pointers\ninto an array of the same size while always keeping adjacent slots in\ndifferent cache lines.\n\nThe mapping from identifier to slot or index into the array gets a bit\nmore complicated than before. Instead of a `shift` and a bitwise\n`and`, we get two `shift`s, two bitwise `and`s, and an `add` (see\nimplementation of `erts_ptab_data2pix()` in `erl_ptab.h`). However, by\nstoring this information optimized for lookup we only need a `shift`\nand a bitwise `and` on 32-bit platforms. On 64-bit platforms we got\nenough room for the 28-bit identifier in the least significant\nhalfword, and the index in the most significant halfword, in other\nwords, we just need to read the most significant halfword to get the\nindex. That is, this operation is as fast, or faster than before. The\ndownside is that on 32-bit platforms we need to convert this\ninformation into the 28-bit identifier number when printing, or when\nordering identifiers from the same node. These operations are,\nhowever, extremely infrequent compared to lookups.\n\nWhen we insert a new element in the table we do the following:\n\n1.  We begin by reserving space in the table by atomically\n    incrementing a counter of processes in the table. If our increment\n    brings the counter above the maximum size of the table, the\n    operation fail and a `system_limit` exception is raised.\n\n2.  The table contains a 64-bit atomic variable of the last identifier\n    used. Only the least significant bits will be used when actually\n    creating the identifier. This identifier is where the search\n    begin.\n\n3.  We increment last identifier value used. In order determine the\n    slot that corresponds to this identifier we call\n    `erts_ptab_data2pix()` that maps identifier to slot. We read the\n    content of the slot. If the slot is free we try to write a\n    reservation marker using an atomic compare and swap. If this fails\n    we repeat this step until it succeeds. \n\n4.  Change the table variable of last identifier used. Since multiple\n    writes might occur at the same time this value may already have\n    been changed by to an identifier larger that the one we got. In\n    this case we can continue; otherwise, we need to change it to the\n    identifier we got.\n\n5.  We now do some initializations of the process structure that\n    cannot be done before we know the process identifier, and have to\n    be done before we publish the structure in the table. This, for\n    example, includes storing the identifier in the process structure. \n\n6.  Now we can publish the structure in the table by writing the\n    pointer to the process structure in the slot previously reserved\n    in 3.\n\nUsing this approach we keep the properties like identifier ordering,\nand identifier reuse while improving performance and scalability. It\nhas one flaw, though. There is no guarantee that the operation will\nterminate. This can quite easily be fixed though, and will be fixed in\nthe next release. We will get back to this below.\n\n#### Delete ####\n\nWhen a process terminates, we mark the process as terminated in the\nprocess structure, the counter of number of processes in the table is\ndecreased, and the reference to the process structure is removed by\nwriting a `NULL` pointer into the corresponding slot. The scheduler\nthread performing this then schedule a thread progress later job which\nwill do the final cleanup and deallocate the process structure. The\nthread progress functionality will make sure that this job will not\nexecute until it is certain that all managed threads have dropped all\nreferences to the process structure.","ref":"ptables.html#modifications-of-the-table"},{"type":"extras","title":"BIF Iterating Over the Table ### - Process and Port Tables","doc":"The `erlang:processes/0` and `erlang:ports/0` BIFs iterate over the\ntables and return corresponding identifiers.

We use an \"inverted rwlock\".\n\nWhen performing lookups in the table we do not need to bother about\nthe locking at all, but when modifying the table we read lock the\nrwlock protecting the table which allows for multiple writers during\nnormal operation. When the BIF that iterates over the table need\naccess to the table it write locks the rwlock and reads content of the\ntable. The BIF do not read the whole table in one go but instead read\nsmall chunks at time only write locking while reading.

The easy fix is to abort the operation if an empty slot could\nnot be found in a finite number operation, and then restart the\noperation under a write lock.

Erlang\nprocesses execute Erlang code in the virtual machine, while an Erlang\nport execute native code typically used for communication with the\noutside world. For example, when an Erlang process wants to\ncommunicate using TCP over the network, it communicates via an Erlang\nport implementing the TCP socket interface in native code. Both Erlang\nProcesses and Ports communicate using asynchronous signaling. The\nnative code executed by an Erlang port is a collection of callback\nfunctions, called a driver. Each callback more or less implements the\ncode of a signal to, or from the port.\n\nEven though processes and ports conceptually always have been very\nsimilar, the implementations have been very different. Originally,\nmore or less all port signals were handled synchronously at the time\nthey occurred. Very early in the development of the SMP support for\nthe runtime system we recognized that this was a huge problem for\nsignals between ports and the outside world. That is, I/O events to\nand from the outside world, or I/O signals. This was one of the first\nthings that had to be rewritten in order to be able to do I/O in\nparallel at all. The solution was to implement scheduling of these\nsignals. I/O signals corresponding to different ports could then be\nexecuted in parallel on different scheduler threads. Signals from\nprocesses to ports was not as big of a problem as the I/O signals, and\nthe implementation of those was left as they were.\n\nEach port is protected by its own lock to protect against simultaneous\nexecution in multiple threads. Previously when a process, executing on\na scheduler thread, sent a port a signal, it locked the port lock and\nsynchronously executed the code corresponding to the signal. If the\nlock was busy, the scheduler thread blocked waiting until it could\nlock the lock. If multiple processes executing simultaneously on\ndifferent scheduler threads, sent signals to the same port, schedulers\nsuffered from heavy lock contention. Such contention could also occur\nbetween I/O signals for the port executing on one scheduler thread,\nand a signal from a process to the port executing on another scheduler\nthread. Beside the contention issues, we also loose potential work to\nexecute in parallel on different scheduler threads. This since the\nprocess sending the *asynchronous* signal is blocked while the code\nimplementing the signal is executed synchronously.\n\nSolution\n--------\n\nIn order to prevent multiple schedulers from trying to execute signals\nto/from the same port simultaneously, we need to be able to ensure\nthat all signals to/from a port are executed in sequence on one\nscheduler. More or less, the only way to do this is to schedule all\ntypes of signals. Signals corresponding to a port can then be executed\nin sequence by one single scheduler thread. If only one thread tries\nto execute the port, no contention will appear on the port\nlock. Besides getting rid of the contention, processes sending signals\nto the port can also continue execution of their own Erlang code on\nother schedulers at the same time as the signaling code is executing\non another scheduler.\n\nWhen implementing this there are a couple of important properties that\nwe either need, or want to preserve:\n\n*   Signal ordering guarantee. Signals from process `X` to port `Y`,\n    *must* be delivered to `Y` in the same order as sent from `X`.\n\n*   Signal latency. Due to the previous synchronous implementation,\n    latency of signals sent from processes to ports have usually been\n    very low. During contention the latency has of course\n    increased. Users expect latency of these signals to be low, a\n    sudden increase in latency would not be appreciated by our users.\n\n*   Compatible flow control. Ports have for a very long time had the\n    possibility to use the busy port functionality when implementing\n    flow control. One may argue that this functionality fits very bad\n    with the conceptually completely asynchronous signaling, but the\n    functionality has been there for ages and is expected to be\n    there. When a port sets itself into a busy state, `command`\n    signals should not be delivered, and senders of such signals\n    should suspend until the port sets itself in a not busy state.","ref":"portsignals.html"},{"type":"extras","title":"Scheduling of Port Signals ### - Port Signals","doc":"A run queue has four queues for processes of different priority and\none queue for ports. The scheduler thread associated with the run\nqueue switch evenly between execution of processes and execution of\nports while both processes and ports exist in the queue. This is not\ncompletely true, but not important for this discussion. A port that is\nin a run queue also has a queue of tasks to execute. Each task\ncorresponds to an in- or outgoing signal. When the port is selected\nfor execution each task will be executed in sequence. The run queue\nlocks not only protected the queues of ports, but also the queues of\nport tasks.\n\nSince we go from a state where I/O signals are the only port related\nsignals scheduled, to a state where potentially all port related\nsignals may be scheduled we may drastically increase the load on the\nrun queue lock. The amount of scheduled port tasks very much depend on\nthe Erlang application executing, which we do not control, and we do\nnot want to get increased contention on the run queue locks. We\ntherefore need another approach of protecting the port task queue.\n\n#### Task Queue ####\n\nWe chose a \"semi locked\" approach, with one public locked task queue,\nand a private, lock free, queue like, task data structure. This \"semi\nlocked\" approach is similar to how the message boxes of processes are\nmanaged. The lock is port specific and only used for protection of\nport tasks, so the run queue lock is now needed in more or less the\nsame way for ports as for processes. This ensures that we won't see an\nincreased lock contention on run queue locks due to this rewrite of\nthe port functionality.\n\nWhen an executing port runs out of work to execute in the private task\ndata structure, it moves the public task queue into the private task\ndata structure while holding the lock. Once tasks has been moved to\nthe private data structure no lock protects them. This way the port\ncan continue working on tasks in the private data structure without\nhaving to fight for the lock.\n\nI/O signals may however be aborted. This could be solved by letting\nthe port specific scheduling lock also protect the private task data\nstructure, but then the port very frequently would have to fight with\nothers enqueueing new tasks. In order to handle this while keeping the\nprivate task data structure lock free, we use a similar \"non\naggressive\" approach as we use when handling processes that gets\nsuspended while in the run queue. Instead of removing the aborted port\ntask, we just mark it as aborted using an atomic memory\noperation. When a task is selected for execution, we first verify that\nit has not been aborted. If aborted we, just drop the task.\n\nA task that can be aborted is referred via another data structure from\nother parts of the system, so that a thread that needs to abort the\ntask can reach it. In order to be sure to safely deallocate a task\nthat is no longer used, we first clear this reference and then use the\nthread progress functionality in order to make sure no references can\nexist to the task. Unfortunately, also unmanaged threads might abort\ntasks. This is very infrequent, but might occur. This could be handled\nlocally for each port, but would require extra information in each\nport structure which very infrequently would be used. Instead of\nimplementing this in each port, we implemented general functionality\nthat can be used from unmanaged threads to delay thread progress.\n\nThe private \"queue like\" task data structure could have been an\nordinary queue if it wasn't for the busy port functionality. When the\nport has flagged itself as busy, `command` signals are not allowed to\nbe delivered and need to be blocked. Other signals sent from the same\nsender following a `command` signal that has been blocked also have to\nbe blocked; otherwise, we would violate the ordering guarantee. At the\nsame time, other signals that have no dependencies to blocked\n`command` signals are expected to be delivered.\n\nThe above requirements makes the private task data structure a rather\ncomplex data structure. It has a queue of unprocessed tasks, and a\nbusy queue. The busy queue contains blocked tasks corresponding to\n`command` signals, and tasks with dependencies to such tasks. The busy\nqueue is accompanied by a table over blocked tasks based on sender\nwith a references into last task in the busy queue from a specific\nsender. This since we need check for dependencies when new tasks are\nprocessed in the queue of unprocessed tasks. When a new task is\nprocessed that needs to be blocked it isn't enqueued at the end of the\nbusy queue, but instead directly after the last task with the same\nsender. This in order to easily be able to detect when we have tasks\nthat no longer have any dependencies to tasks corresponding to\n`command` signals which should be moved out of the busy queue. When\nthe port executes, it switches between processing tasks from the busy\nqueue, and processing directly from the unprocessed queue based on its\nbusy state. When processing directly from the unprocessed queue it\nmight, of course, have to move a task into the busy queue instead of\nexecuting it.\n\n#### Busy Port Queue ####\n\nSince it is the port itself which decides when it is time to enter a\nbusy state, it needs to be executing in order to enter the busy\nstate. As a result of `command` signals being scheduled, we may get\ninto a situation where the port gets flooded by a huge amount of\n`command` signals before it even gets a chance to set itself into a\nbusy state. This since it has not been scheduled for execution\nyet. That is, under these circumstances the busy port functionality\nloose the flow control properties it was intended to provide.\n\nIn order to solve this, we introduced a new busy feature, namely \"busy\nport queue\". The port has a limit of `command` data that is allowed to\nbe enqueued in the task queue. When this limit is reached, the port\nwill automatically enter a busy port queue state. When in this state,\nsenders of `command` signals will be suspended, but `command` signals\nwill still be delivered to the port unless it is also in a busy port\nstate. This limit is known as the high limit.\n\nThere is also a low limit. When the amount of queued `command` data\nfalls below this limit and the port is in a busy port queue state, the\nbusy port queue state is automatically disabled. The low limit should\ntypically be significantly lower than the high limit in order to\nprevent frequent oscillation around the busy port queue state.\n\nBy introduction of this new busy state we still can provide the flow\ncontrol. Old driver do not even have to be changed. The limits can,\nhowever, be configured and even disabled by the port. By default the\nhigh limit is 8 KB and the low limit is 4 KB.","ref":"portsignals.html#scheduling-of-port-signals"},{"type":"extras","title":"Preparation of Signal Send ### - Port Signals","doc":"Previously all operations sending signals to ports began by acquiring\nthe port lock, then performed preparations for sending the signal, and\nthen finally sent the signal.

That is we would\nlike to do this without having the port lock locked.\n\nIn order to improve this, state information was re-organized in the\nport structure, so that we can access it using atomic memory\noperations.

The most important\nbeing able to determine if we should enqueue a process in a specific\nrun queue or not. This involves being able to read actual load, and\nload balancing information.\n\nThe load balancing functionality is triggered at repeated fixed\nintervals. The load balancing more or less strives to even out run\nqueue lengths over the system. When balancing is triggered,\ninformation about every run queue is gathered, migrations paths and\nrun queue length limits are set up. Migration paths and limits are\nfixed until the next balancing has been done. The most important\ninformation about each run queue is the maximum run queue length since\nlast balancing. All of this information were previously stored in the\nrun queues themselves.\n\nWhen a process has become runnable, for example due to reception of a\nmessage, we need to determine which run queue to enqueue it\nin. Previously this at least involved locking the run queue that the\nprocess currently was assigned to while holding the status lock on the\nprocess. Depending on load we sometimes also had to acquire a lock on\nanother run queue in order to be able to determine if it should be\nmigrated to that run queue or not.\n\nIn order to be able to decide which run queue to use without having to\nlock any run queues, we moved all fixed balancing information out of\nthe run queues into a global memory block. That is, migration paths\nand run queue limits. Information that need to be frequently updated,\nlike for example maximum run queue length, were kept in the run queue,\nbut instead of operating on this information under locks we now use\natomic memory operations when accessing this information. This made it\npossible to first determine which run queue to use, without locking\nany run queues, and when decided, lock the chosen run queue and insert\nthe process.\n\n#### Fixed Balancing Information ####\n\nWhen determining which run queue to choose we need to read the fixed\nbalancing information that we moved out of the run queues. This\ninformation is global, read only between load balancing operations,\nbut will be changed during a load balancing. We do not want to\nintroduce a global lock that needs to be acquired when accessing this\ninformation. A reader optimized rwlock could avoid some of the\noverhead since the data is most frequently read, but it would\nunavoidably cause disruption during load balancing, since this\ninformation is very frequently read. The likelihood of a large\ndisruption due to this also increase as number of schedulers grows.\n\nInstead of using a global lock protecting modifications of this\ninformation, we write a completely new version of it at each load\nbalancing. The new version is written in another memory block than the\nprevious one, and published by issuing a write memory barrier and then\nstoring a pointer to the new memory block in a global variable using\nan atomic write operation.\n\nWhen schedulers need to read this information, they read the pointer\nto currently used information using an atomic read operation, and then\nissue a data dependency read barrier, which on most architectures is a\nno-op. That is, it is very little overhead getting access to this\ninformation.\n\nInstead of allocating and deallocating memory blocks for the different\nversions of the balancing information we keep old memory blocks and\nreuse them when it is safe to do so. In order to be able to determine\nwhen it is safe to reuse a block we use the thread progress\nfunctionality, ensuring that no threads have any references to the\nmemory block when we reuse it.\n\n#### Be Less Aggressive ####\n\nWe implemented a test version using lock free run queues. This\nimplementation did however not perform as good as the version using\none lock per run queue. The reason for this was not investigated\nenough to say why this was. Since the locked version performed better\nwe kept it, at least for now. The lock free version, however, forced\nus to use other solutions, some of them we kept.\n\nPreviously when a process that was in a run queue got suspended, we\nremoved it from the queue straight away. This involved locking the\nprocess, locking the run queue, and then unlinking it from the double\nlinked list implementing the queue. Removing a process from a lock\nfree queue gets really complicated. Instead, of removing it from the\nqueue, we just leave it in the queue and mark it as suspended. When\nlater selected for execution we check if the process is suspended, if\nso just dropped it. During its time in the queue, it might also get\nresumed again, if so execute it when it get selected for execution.\n\nBy keeping this part when reverting back to a locked implementation,\nwe could remove a pointer field in each process structure, and avoid\nunnecessary operations on the process and the queue which might cause\ncontention.","ref":"processmanagementoptimizations.html#run-queue"},{"type":"extras","title":"Combined Modifications ### - Process Management Optimizations","doc":"By combining the modifications of the process state management and the\nrun queue management, we can do large parts of the work involved when\nmanaging processes with regards to scheduling and migration without\nhaving any locks locked at all.

They are both rather large blocks of continuous\nmemory, but MBCs and SBCs have different demands on alignment and\nsize.\n\nSBCs can have arbitrary size and do only need minimum 8-byte\nalignment.\n\nMBCs are more restricted. They can only have a number of fixed\nsizes that are powers of 2. The start address need to have a very\nlarge alignment (currently 256 kb, called \"super alignment\"). This is a\ndesign choice that allows very low overhead per allocated block in the\nMBC.\n\nTo reduce fragmentation within the super carrier, it is good to keep SBCs\nand MBCs apart. MBCs with their uniform alignment and sizes can be\npacked very efficiently together. SBCs without demand for alignment can\nalso be allocated quite efficiently together. But mixing them can lead\nto a lot of memory wasted when we need to create large holes of\npadding to the next alignment limit.\n\nThe super carrier thus contains two areas. One area for MBCs growing from\nthe bottom and up. And one area for SBCs growing from the top and\ndown.

One initial idea was to use the same\nmechanism that is used to keep track of free blocks within MBCs\n(alloc\\_util and the different strategies). However, that would not be\nas straight forward as one can think and can also waste quite a lot of\nmemory as it uses prepended block headers. The granularity of the\nsuper carrier is one memory page (usually 4kb). We want to allocate\nand free entire pages and we don't want to waste an entire page just\nto hold the block header of the following pages.\n\nInstead we store the meta information about all the free segments in a\ndedicated area apart from the `sa` and `sua` areas. Every free segment is\nrepresented by a descriptor struct (`ErtsFreeSegDesc`).\n\n    typedef struct {\n        RBTNode snode;      /* node in 'stree' */\n        RBTNode anode;      /* node in 'atree' */\n        char* start;\n        char* end;\n    }ErtsFreeSegDesc;\n\nTo find the smallest free segment that will satisfy a carrier allocation\n(best fit), the free segments are organized in a tree sorted by\nsize (`stree`). We search in this tree at allocation. If no free segment of\nsufficient size was found, the area (`sa` or `sua`) is instead expanded.\nIf two or more free segments with equal size exist, the one at lowest\naddress is chosen for `sa` and highest address for `sua`.\n\nAt carrier deallocation, we want to coalesce with any adjacent free\nsegments, to form one large free segment. To do that, all free\nsegments are also organized in a tree sorted in address order (`atree`).\n\nSo, in total we keep four trees of free descriptors for the super\ncarrier; two for `sa` and two for `sua`. They all use the same\nred-black-tree implementation that support the different sorting\norders used.\n\nWhen allocating a new MBC we first search after a free segment in `sa`,\nthen try to raise `sa.top`, and then as a fallback try to search after a\nfree segment in `sua`. When an MBC is allocated in `sua`, a larger segment\nis allocated which is then trimmed to obtain the right\nalignment. Allocation search for an SBC is done in reverse order.

Not all threads in the system are able to frequently report\nprogress. Such threads cannot be allowed in the set of managed threads\nand are called unmanaged threads. An example of unmanaged threads are\nthreads in the async thread pool. Async threads can be blocked for\nvery long times and by this be prevented from frequently reporting\nprogress. Currently only scheduler threads and a couple of other\nthreads are managed threads.","ref":"threadprogress.html#knowing-that-modifications-of-memory-is-consistently-observed"},{"type":"extras","title":"Thread Progress Events ### - Thread Progress","doc":"Any thread in the system may use the thread progress functionality in\norder to determine when the following events have occurred at least\nonce in all managed threads:\n\n1.  The thread has returned from other code to a known state in the\n    thread progress functionality, which is independent of any other\n    code. \n2.  The thread has executed a full memory barrier.\n\nThese events, of course, need to occur ordered to other memory\noperations. The operation of determining this begins by initiating the\nthread progress operation. The thread that initiated the thread\nprogress operation after this poll for the completion of the\noperation. Both of these events must occur at least once *after* the\nthread progress operation has been initiated, and at least once\n*before* the operation has completed in each managed thread. This is\nordered using communication via memory which makes it possible to draw\nconclusion about the memory state after the thread progress operation\nhas completed. Lets call the progress made from initiation to\ncompletion for \"thread progress\".\n\nAssuming that the thread progress functionality is efficient, a lot of\nalgorithms can both be simplified and made more efficient than using\nthe first approach that comes to mind. A couple of examples follows.\n\nBy being able to determine when the first event above has occurred we\ncan easily know when all managed threads have completed accesses to a\ndata structure. This can be determined the following way. We have an\nimplementation of some functionality `F` using a data structure\n`D`. The reference to `D` is always looked up before `D` is being\naccessed, and the references to `D` is always dropped before we leave\nthe code implementing `F`. If we remove the possibility to look up `D`\nand then wait until the first event has occurred in all managed\nthreads, no managed threads can have any references to the data\nstructure `D`. This could for example have been achieved by using\nreference counting, but the cache line containing the reference\ncounter would in this case be ping ponged between all processors\naccessing `D` at every access.\n\nBy being able to determine when the second event has occurred it is\nquite easy to do complex modifications of memory that needs to be seen\nconsistently by other threads without having to resort to locking. By\ndoing the modifications, then issuing a full memory barrier, then wait\nuntil the second event has occurred in all managed threads, and then\npublish the modifications, we know that all managed threads reading\nthis memory will get a consistent view of the modifications.

These confirmation cache lines are located in sequence in an\narray, and each confirmation cache line will only be written by one\nand only one thread. One of the managed threads always have the leader\nresponsibility. This responsibility may jump between threads, but as\nlong as there are some activity in the system always one of them will\nhave the leader responsibility. The thread with the leader\nresponsibility will call `erts_thr_progress_leader_update()` which\nwill check that all other threads have confirmed an increment of the\nglobal counter before doing the increment of the global counter. The\nleader thread is the only thread reading the confirmation cache\nlines.\n\nDoing it this way we will get a communication pattern of information\ngoing from the leader thread out to all other managed threads and then\nback from the other threads to the leader thread. This since only the\nleader thread will write to the global counter and all other threads\nwill only read it, and since each confirmation cache lines will only\nbe written by one specific thread and only read by the leader\nthread. When each managed thread is distributed over different\nprocessors, the communication between processors will be a reflection\nof this communication pattern between threads.\n\nThe value returned from `erts_thr_progress_later()` equals the, by\nthis thread, latest confirmed value plus two. The global value may be\nlatest confirmed value or latest confirmed value minus one. In order\nto be certain that all other managed threads actually will call\n`erts_thr_progress_update()` at least once before we reach the value\nreturned from `erts_thr_progress_later()`, the global counter plus one\nis not enough. This since all other threads may already have confirmed\ncurrent global value plus one at the time when we call\n`erts_thr_progress_later()`. They are however guaranteed not to have\nconfirmed global value plus two at this time.\n\nThe above described implementation more or less minimizes the\ncommunication needed before we can increment the global counter. The\namount of communication in the system due to the thread progress\nfunctionality however also depend on the frequency with which managed\nthreads call `erts_thr_progress_update()`. Today each scheduler thread\ncalls `erts_thr_progress_update()` more or less each time an Erlang\nprocess is scheduled out. One way of further reducing communication\ndue to the thread progress functionality is to only call\n`erts_thr_progress_update()` every second, or third time an Erlang\nprocess is scheduled out, or even less frequently than that. However,\nby doing updates of thread progress less frequently all operations\ndepending on the thread progress functionality will also take a longer\ntime.\n\n#### Delay of Thread Progress by Unmanaged Threads ####\n\nIn order to implement delay of thread progress from unmanaged threads\nwe use two reference counters. One being `current` and one being\n`waiting`. When an unmanaged thread wants to delay thread progress it\nincrements `current` and gets a handle back to the reference counter\nit incremented. When it later wants to enable continuation of thread\nprogress it uses the handle to decrement the reference counter it\npreviously incremented.\n\nWhen the leader threads is about to increment the global thread\nprogress counter it verifies that the `waiting` counter is zero before\ndoing so. If not zero, the leader isn't allowed to increment the\nglobal counter, and needs to wait before it can do this. When it is\nzero, it swaps the `waiting` and `current` counters before increasing\nthe global counter. From now on the new `waiting` counter will\ndecrease, so that it eventually will reach zero, making it possible to\nincrement the global counter the next time. If we only used one\nreference counter it would potentially be held above zero for ever by\ndifferent unmanaged threads.\n\nWhen an unmanaged thread increment the `current` counter it will not\nprevent the next increment of the global counter, but instead the\nincrement after that. This is sufficient since the global counter\nneeds to be incremented two times before thread progress has been\nmade. It is also desirable not to prevent the first increment, since\nthe likelihood increases that the delay is withdrawn before any\nincrement of the global counter is delayed. That is, the operation\nwill cause as little disruption as possible.\n\nHowever, this feature of delaying thread progress from unmanaged\nthreads should preferably be used as little as possible, since heavy\nuse of it will cause contention on the reference counter cache\nlines. The functionality is however very useful in code which normally\nonly executes in managed threads, but which may under some infrequent\ncircumstances be executed in other threads.\n\n#### Overhead ####\n\nThe overhead caused by the thread progress functionality is more or\nless fixed using the same amount of schedulers regardless of the\nnumber of uses of the functionality. Already today quite a lot of\nfunctionality use it, and we plan to use it even more. When rewriting\nold implementations of ERTS internal functionality to use the thread\nprogress functionality, this implies removing communication in the old\nimplementation. Otherwise it is simply no point rewriting the old\nimplementation to use the thread progress functionality. Since the\nthread progress overhead is more or less fixed, the rewrite will cause\na reduction of the total communication in the system.\n\n##### An Example #####\n\nThe main structure of an ETS table was originally managed using\nreference counting. Already a long time ago we replaced this strategy\nsince the reference counter caused contention on each access of the\ntable. The solution used was to schedule \"confirm deletion\" jobs on\neach scheduler in order to know when it was safe to deallocate the\ntable structure of a removed table. These confirm deletion jobs needed\nto be allocated. That is, we had to allocate and deallocate as many\nblocks as schedulers in order to deallocate one block. This of course\nwas a quite an expensive operation, but we only needed to do this once\nwhen removing a table. It was more important to get rid of the\ncontention on the reference counter which was present on every\noperation on the table.\n\nWhen the thread progress functionality had been introduced, we could\nremove the code implementing the \"confirm deletion\" jobs, and then\njust schedule a thread progress later operation which deallocates the\nstructure. Besides simplifying the code a lot, we got an increase of\nmore than 10% of the number of transactions per second handled on a\nmnesia tpcb benchmark executing on a quad core machine.","ref":"threadprogress.html#implementation"},{"type":"extras","title":"Tracing","doc":"# Tracing","ref":"tracing.html"},{"type":"extras","title":"Implementation - Tracing","doc":"","ref":"tracing.html#implementation"},{"type":"extras","title":"Call, return, and exception tracing - Tracing","doc":"Tracing is implemented by setting breakpoints in the traced functions,\nand sending the appropriate trace messages when they're hit.\n\n* Call trace messages are sent immediately.\n* Return tracing pushes a frame to the stack which _returns to_ an\n  instruction that sends a trace message when encountered.\n* Exception tracing also pushes a frame to the stack, but will only send\n  a trace message if we encounter it in stack scanning while throwing an\n  exception.\n\nThis means that one must be careful not to use return or exception tracing\non functions that never return, as each call pushes a frame that will\nnever be removed.\n\nAnother limitation is that since the breakpoint is in the _callee_ and not\nthe _caller_, we're limited to the information we have on function ingress.\nThis means that we can't actually tell who called us: since we're limited\nto inspecting the stack we can only say where we're _going to return to_,\nwhich is not quite the same thing.\n\nAs an illustration, when the `caller` option is enabled all trace messages\nfrom `bar/1`  will say that they were called from `foo/0`, even though it\nwent through a bunch of other functions on the way:\n\n    foo() ->\n        lots(),\n        ok.\n    \n    lots() ->\n        'of'().\n    \n    'of'() ->\n        indirections().\n    \n    indirections() ->\n        bar(10).\n    \n    bar(0) ->\n        done;\n    bar(N) ->\n        bar(N - 1).","ref":"tracing.html#call-return-and-exception-tracing"},{"type":"extras","title":"Export tracing - Tracing","doc":"In the interpreter, breakpoints are set inside the code trampoline for\nexport entries, and their address vector is updated to point to them.\nThis way, only remote calls will hit the breakpoint while local calls to\nthe same function are left alone, but it otherwise acts the same way as\nlocal breakpoints.\n\nThings get a bit more involved in the JIT.

They will get the breakpoint\nstructure written in step 3, read `erts_active_bp_index` and execute\nthe corresponding part of the breakpoint. Before the switch in step 8\nbecomes visible they will however execute the disabled part of the\nbreakpoint structure and do nothing other than executing the saved\noriginal instruction.\n\nThe consolidation in step 10 will make the new staging area identical\nto the new active area. This will make it simpler for the next call to\n`trace_pattern` that may not affect all existing breakpoints.

We do\nbasically the same sequence to update the settings of an existing\nbreakpoint except step 2,3 and 6 can be skipped as it has already been\ndone.\n\nTo remove a breakpoint some more steps are needed. The idea is to\nfirst stage the breakpoint as disabled, do the switch, wait for thread\nprogress and then remove the disabled breakpoint by restoring the\noriginal beam instruction.\n\nHere is a more complete sequence that contains both adding, updating\nand removing breakpoints.\n\n1. Seize exclusive code modification permission (suspend process until we get\n   it).\n\n2. Allocate new breakpoint structures with a disabled active area and\n   the original beam instruction.

Given a number of input files (all with\nthe extension `.tab`), it will generate source files used by the\nErlang compiler and by the runtime system to load and execute BEAM\ninstructions.\n\nEssentially those `.tab` files define:\n\n* External generic BEAM instructions.  They are the instructions that\nare known to both the compiler and the runtime system.  Generic\ninstructions are stable between releases.  New generic instructions\nwith high numbers than previous instructions can be added in major\nreleases.  The OTP 20 release has 159 external generic instructions.\n\n* Internal generic instructions.  They are known only to the runtime\nsystem and can be changed at any time without compatibility issues.\nThey are created by transformation rules (described next).\n\n* Rules for transforming one or more generic instructions to other\ngeneric instructions.  The transformation rules allow combining,\nsplitting, and removal of instructions, as well as shuffling operands.\nBecause of the transformation rules, the runtime can have many\ninternal generic instructions that are only known to runtime system.\n\n* Specific BEAM instructions.  The specific instructions are the\ninstructions that are actually executed by the runtime system.  They\ncan be changed at any time without causing compatibility issues.\nThe loader translates generic instructions to specific instructions.\nIn general, for each generic instruction, there exists a family of\nspecific instructions.  The OTP 20 release has 389 specific\ninstructions.\n\n* The implementation of specific instructions for the traditional\nBEAM interpreter. For the [BeamAsm JIT](BeamAsm.md) introduced\nin OTP 24, the implementation of instructions are defined in emitter\nfunctions written in C++.\n\nGeneric instructions have typed operands. Here are a few examples of\noperands for `move/2`:\n\n    {move,{atom,id},{x,5}}.\n    {move,{x,3},{x,0}}.\n    {move,{x,2},{y,1}}.\n\nWhen those instructions are loaded, the loader rewrites them\nto specific instructions:\n\n    move_cx id 5\n    move_xx 3 0\n    move_xy 2 1\n\nCorresponding to each generic instruction, there is a family of\nspecific instructions.  The types that an instance of a specific\ninstruction can handle are encoded in the instruction names.  For\nexample, `move_xy` takes an X register number as the first operand and\na Y register number as the second operand.  `move_cx` takes a tagged\nErlang term as the first operand and an X register number as the\nsecond operand.\n\nAn example: the move instruction\n--------------------------------\n\nUsing the `move` instruction as an example, we will give a quick\ntour to show the main features of **beam\\_makeops**.\n\nIn the `compiler` application, in the file `genop.tab`, there is the\nfollowing line:\n\n    64: move/2\n\nThis is a definition of an external generic BEAM instruction. Most\nimportantly it specifies that the opcode is 64.  It also defines that\nit has two operands.  The BEAM assembler will use the opcode when\ncreating `.beam` files.  The compiler does not really need the arity,\nbut it will use it as an internal sanity check when assembling the\nBEAM code.\n\nLet's have a look at `ops.tab` in `erts/emulator/beam/emu`, where the\nspecific `move` instructions are defined.  Here are a few of them:\n\n    move x x\n    move x y\n    move c x\n\nEach specific instructions is defined by following the name of the\ninstruction with the types for each operand.  An operand type is a\nsingle letter.  For example, `x` means an X register, `y`\nmeans a Y register, and `c` is a \"constant\" (a tagged term such as\nan integer, an atom, or a literal).\n\nNow let's look at the implementation of the `move` instruction.  There\nare multiple files containing implementations of instructions in the\n`erts/emulator/beam/emu` directory.  The `move` instruction is defined\nin `instrs.tab`.  It looks like this:\n\n    move(Src, Dst) {\n        $Dst = $Src;\n    }\n\nThe implementation for an instruction largely follows the C syntax,\nexcept that the variables in the function head don't have any types.\nThe `$` before an identifier denotes a macro expansion.  Thus,\n`$Src` will expand to the code to pick up the source operand for\nthe instruction and `$Dst` to the code for the destination register.\n\nWe will look at the code for each specific instruction in turn.  To\nmake the code easier to understand, let's first look at the memory\nlayout for the instruction `{move,{atom,id},{x,5}}`:\n\n         +--------------------+--------------------+\n    I -> |                 40 |       &&lb_move_cx |\n         +--------------------+--------------------+\n         |                        Tagged atom 'id' |\n         +--------------------+--------------------+\n\nThis example and all other examples in the document assumes a 64-bit\narchitecture, and furthermore that pointers to C code fit in 32 bits.\n\n`I` in the BEAM virtual machine is the instruction pointer.  When BEAM\nexecutes an instruction, `I` points to the first word of the\ninstruction.\n\n`&&lb_move_cx` is the address to C code that implements `move_cx`.  It\nis stored in the lower 32 bits of the word.  In the upper 32 bits is\nthe byte offset to the X register; the register number 5 has been\nmultiplied by the word size size 8.\n\nIn the next word the tagged atom `id` is stored.\n\nWith that background, we can look at the generated code for `move_cx`\nin `beam_hot.h`:\n\n    OpCase(move_cx):\n    {\n      BeamInstr next_pf = BeamCodeAddr(I[2]);\n      xb(BeamExtraData(I[0])) = I[1];\n      I += 2;\n      ASSERT(VALID_INSTR(next_pf));\n      GotoPF(next_pf);\n    }\n\nWe will go through each line in turn.\n\n* `OpCase(move_cx):` defines a label for the instruction.  The\n`OpCase()` macro is defined in `beam_emu.c`.  It will expand this line\nto `lb_move_cx:`.\n\n* `BeamInstr next_pf = BeamCodeAddr(I[2]);` fetches the pointer to\ncode for the next instruction to be executed.  The `BeamCodeAddr()`\nmacro extracts the pointer from the lower 32 bits of the instruction\nword.\n\n* `xb(BeamExtraData(I[0])) = I[1];` is the expansion of `$Dst = $Src`.\n`BeamExtraData()` is a macro that will extract the upper 32 bits from\nthe instruction word.  In this example, it will return 40 which is the\nbyte offset for X register 5.  The `xb()` macro will cast a byte\npointer to an `Eterm` pointer and dereference it.  The `I[1]` on\nthe right-hand side of the `=` fetches an Erlang term (the atom `id` in\nthis case).\n\n* `I += 2` advances the instruction pointer to the next\ninstruction.\n\n* In a debug-compiled emulator, `ASSERT(VALID_INSTR(next_pf));` makes\nsure that `next_pf` is a valid instruction (that is, that it points\nwithin the `process_main()` function in `beam_emu.c`).\n\n* `GotoPF(next_pf);` transfers control to the next instruction.\n\nNow let's look at the implementation of `move_xx`:\n\n    OpCase(move_xx):\n    {\n      Eterm tmp_packed1 = BeamExtraData(I[0]);\n      BeamInstr next_pf = BeamCodeAddr(I[1]);\n      xb((tmp_packed1>>BEAM_TIGHT_SHIFT)) = xb(tmp_packed1&BEAM_TIGHT_MASK);\n      I += 1;\n      ASSERT(VALID_INSTR(next_pf));\n      GotoPF(next_pf);\n    }\n\nWe will go through the lines that are new or have changed compared to\n`move_cx`.\n\n* `Eterm tmp_packed1 = BeamExtraData(I[0]);` picks up both X register\nnumbers packed into the upper 32 bits of the instruction word.\n\n* `BeamInstr next_pf = BeamCodeAddr(I[1]);` pre-fetches the address of\nthe next instruction. Note that because both X registers operands fits\ninto the instruction word, the next instruction is in the very next\nword.\n\n* `xb((tmp_packed1>>BEAM_TIGHT_SHIFT)) = xb(tmp_packed1&BEAM_TIGHT_MASK);`\ncopies the source to the destination.  (For a 64-bit architecture,\n`BEAM_TIGHT_SHIFT` is 16 and `BEAM_TIGHT_MASK` is `0xFFFF`.)\n\n* `I += 1;` advances the instruction pointer to the next instruction.\n\n`move_xy` is almost identical to `move_xx`.  The only difference is\nthe use of the `yb()` macro instead of `xb()` to reference the\ndestination register:\n\n    OpCase(move_xy):\n    {\n      Eterm tmp_packed1 = BeamExtraData(I[0]);\n      BeamInstr next_pf = BeamCodeAddr(I[1]);\n      yb((tmp_packed1>>BEAM_TIGHT_SHIFT)) = xb(tmp_packed1&BEAM_TIGHT_MASK);\n      I += 1;\n      ASSERT(VALID_INSTR(next_pf));\n      GotoPF(next_pf);\n    }","ref":"beam_makeops.html"},{"type":"extras","title":"Transformation rules ### - The beam_makeops script","doc":"Next let's look at how we can do some optimizations using transformation\nrules.  For simple instructions such as `move/2`, the instruction dispatch\noverhead can be substantial.  A simple optimization is to combine common\ninstructions sequences to a single instruction.  One such common sequence\nis multiple `move` instructions moving X registers to Y registers.\n\nUsing the following rule we can combine two `move` instructions\nto a `move2` instruction:\n\n    move X1=x Y1=y | move X2=x Y2=y => move2 X1 Y1 X2 Y2\n\nThe left-hand side of the arrow (`=>`) is a pattern.  If the pattern\nmatches, the matching instructions will be replaced by the\ninstructions on the right-hand side.  Variables in a pattern must start\nwith an uppercase letter just as in Erlang.  A pattern variable may be\nfollowed `=` and one or more type letters to constrain the match to\none of those types.  The variables that are bound on the left-hand side can\nbe used on the right-hand side.\n\nWe will also need to define a specific instruction and an implementation:\n\n    # In ops.tab\n    move2 x y x y\n\n    // In instrs.tab\n    move2(S1, D1, S2, D2) {\n        Eterm V1, V2;\n        V1 = $S1;\n        V2 = $S2;\n        $D1 = V1;\n        $D2 = V2;\n    }\n\nWhen the loader has found a match and replaced the matched instructions,\nit will match the new instructions against the transformation rules.\nBecause of that, we can define the rule for a `move3/6` instruction\nas follows:\n\n    move2 X1=x Y1=y X2=x Y2=y | move X3=x Y3=y =>\n          move3 X1 Y1 X2 Y2 X3 Y3\n\n(For readability, a long transformation line can be broken after `|`\nand `=>` operators.)\n\nIt would also be possible to define it like this:\n\n    move X1=x Y1=y | move X2=x Y2=y | move X3=x Y3=y =>\n         move3 X1 Y1 X2 Y2 X3 Y3\n\nbut in that case it must be defined before the rule for `move2/4`\nbecause the first matching rule will be applied.\n\nOne must be careful not to create infinite loops.  For example, if we\nfor some reason would want to reverse the operand order for the `move`\ninstruction, we must not do like this:\n\n    move Src Dst => move Dst Src\n\nThe loader would swap the operands forever.  To avoid the loop, we must\nrename the instruction.  For example:\n\n    move Src Dst => assign Dst Src\n\nThis concludes the quick tour of the features of **beam\\_makeops**.\n\nShort overview of instruction loading for the interpreter\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo give some background to the rest of this document, here follows a\nquick overview of how instructions are loaded.\n\n* The loader reads and decodes one instruction at a time from the BEAM\ncode and creates a generic instruction.  Many transformation rules\nmust look at multiple instructions, so the loader will\nkeep multiple generic instructions in a linked list.\n\n* The loader tries to apply transformation rules against the\ngeneric instructions in the linked list.  If a rule matches, the\nmatched instructions will be removed and replaced with new\ngeneric instructions constructed from the right-hand side of the\ntransformation.\n\n* If a transformation rule matched, the loader applies the\ntransformation rules again.\n\n* If no transformation rule match, the loader will begin rewriting\nthe first of generic instructions to a specific instruction.\n\n* First the loader will search for a specific operation where the\ntypes for all operands match the type for the generic instruction.\nThe first matching instruction will be selected.  **beam\\_makeops**\nhas ordered the specific instructions so that instructions with more\nspecific operands comes before instructions with less specific\noperands.  For example, `move_nx` is more specific than `move_cx`.  If\nthe first operand is `[]` (NIL), `move_nx` will be selected.\n\n* Given the opcode for the selected specific instruction, the loader\nlooks up the pointer to the C code for the instruction and stores\nin the code area for the module being loaded.\n\n* The loader translates each operand to a machine word and stores it\nin the code area.  The operand type for the selected specific\ninstruction guides the translation.  For example, if the type is `e`,\nthe value of the operand is an index into an array of external\nfunctions and will be translated to a pointer to the export entry for\nthe function to call.  If the type is `x`, the number of the X\nregister will be multiplied by the word size to produce a byte offset.\n\n* The loader runs the packing engine to pack multiple operands into a\nsingle word.  The packing engine is controlled by a small program,\nwhich is a string where each character is an instruction.  For\nexample, the code to pack the operands for `move_xy` is `\"22#\"` (on a\n64-bit machine).  That program will pack the byte offsets for both\nregisters into the same word as the pointer to C code.\n\nShort overview of instruction loading for BeamAsm\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n* The first steps up to selection of a specific instruction is done\nas described for the interpreter.  The selection of a specific instruction\nis simpler, because in BeamAsm most generic instructions only have\na single corresponding specific instruction.\n\n* The loader calls the *emitter function* for the selected specific\ninstruction.  The emitter function translates the instruction to\nmachine code.\n\nRunning beam_makeops\n--------------------\n\n**beam\\_makeops** is found in `$ERL_TOP/erts/emulator/utils`.

They can be changed\nat any time without causing compatibility issues.\n\nA specific instruction can have at most 6 operands if the family of\ninstructions it belongs to has more than one member.  The number of\noperands is unlimited if there is only a single specific instruction\nin a family.\n\nA specific instruction is defined by first giving its name followed by\nthe types for each operand.  For example:\n\n     move x y\n\nInternally, for example in the generated code and in the output from\nthe BEAM disassembler, the instruction `move x y` will be called `move_xy`.\n\nThe name for a specific instruction is an identifier starting with a\nlowercase letter.  A type is a lowercase or uppercase letter.\n\nAll specific instructions with a given name must have the same number\nof operands. That is, the following is **not** allowed:\n\n     move x x\n     move x y x y\n\nHere follows the type letters that more or less directly corresponds\nto the types for generic instructions.\n\n* `x` - X register.  Will be loaded as a byte offset to the X register\nrelative to the base of X register array.  (Can be packed with other\noperands.)\n\n* `y` - Y register.

(Can be packed with other\noperands.)\n\n* `a` - Tagged atom.\n\n* `n` - NIL or the empty list.  (Will not be stored in the loaded code.)\n\n* `q` - Tagged CONS or BOXED pointer.  That is, a term such as a list\nor tuple.  Any heap object type is supported, even types that don't\nhave real literals such as external references.\n\n* `f` - Failure label (non-zero).  The target for a branch\nor call instruction.\n\n* `p` - The 0 failure label, meaning that an exception should be raised\nif the instruction fails.  (Will not be stored in the loaded code.)\n\n* `c` - Any literal term; that is, immediate literals such as SMALL,\nand CONS or BOXED pointers to literals.  (Can be used where the\noperand in the generic instruction has one of the types `i`, `a`, `n`,\nor `q`.)\n\nThe types that follow do a type test of the operand at runtime; thus,\nthey are generally more expensive in terms of runtime than the types\ndescribed earlier.  However, those operand types are needed to avoid a\ncombinatorial explosion in the number of specific instructions and\noverall code size of `process_main()`.\n\n* `s` - Tagged source: X register, Y register, or a literal term.  The\ntag will be tested at runtime to retrieve the value from an X\nregister, a Y register, or simply use the value as a tagged Erlang\nterm.  (Implementation note: An X register is tagged as a pid, and a Y\nregister as a port.  Therefore the literal term must not contain a\nport or pid.)\n\n* `S` - Tagged source register (X or Y).  The tag will be tested at\nruntime to retrieve the value from an X register or a Y register.  Slightly\ncheaper than `s`.\n\n* `d` - Tagged destination register (X or Y).  The tag will be tested\nat runtime to set up a pointer to the destination register.  If the\ninstruction performs a garbage collection, it must use the\n`$REFRESH_GEN_DEST()` macro to refresh the pointer before storing to\nit (there are more details about that in a later section).\n\n* `j` - A failure label (combination of `f` and `p`).  If the branch target 0,\nan exception will be raised if instruction fails, otherwise control will be\ntransferred to the target address.\n\nThe types that follows are all applied to an operand that has the `u`\ntype.\n\n* `t` - An untagged integer that will fit in 12 bits (0-4096).  It can be\npacked with other operands in a word.  Most often used as the number\nof live registers in instructions such as `test_heap`.\n\n* `I` - An untagged integer that will fit in 32 bits.  It can be\npacked with other operands in a word on a 64-bit system.\n\n* `W` - Untagged integer or pointer.  Not possible to pack with other\noperands.\n\n* `e` - Pointer to an export entry.  Use by call instructions that call\nother modules, such as `call_ext`.\n\n* `L` - A label.  Only used by the `label/1` instruction.\n\n* `b` - Pointer to BIF.  Used in BIF instructions such as `call_bif`.\n\n* `F` - Pointer to a fun entry. Used in `make_fun2` and friends.\n\n* `A` - A tagged arityvalue.  Used in instructions that test the arity\nof a tuple.\n\n* `P` - A byte offset into a tuple.\n\n* `Q` - A byte offset into the stack.  Used for updating the frame\npointer register.  Can be packed with other operands.\n\n* `*` - This operand must be the last operand.  It indicates that a\nvariable number of operands follow.  Its use is mandatory for BeamAsm\nwhen an instruction has a variable number of operands; see [handling a\nvariable number of operands](#handling-a-variable-number-of-operands).\nIt can be used for the interpreter as documentation, but it will have\nno effect on the code generation.\n\nWhen the loader translates a generic instruction a specific\ninstruction, it will choose the most specific instruction that will\nfit the types.  Consider the following two instructions:\n\n    move c x\n    move n x\n\nThe `c` operand can encode any literal value, including NIL.  The\n`n` operand only works for NIL.  If we have the generic instruction\n`{move,nil,{x,1}}`, the loader will translate it to `move_nx 1`\nbecause `move n x` is more specific.  `move_nx` could be slightly\nfaster or smaller (depending on the architecture), because the `[]`\nis not stored explicitly as an operand.\n\n#### Syntactic sugar for specific instructions ####\n\nIt is possible to specify more than one type letter for each operand.\nHere is an example:\n\n    move cxy xy\n\nThis is syntactic sugar for:\n\n    move c x\n    move c y\n    move x x\n    move x y\n    move y x\n    move y y\n\nNote the difference between `move c xy` and `move c d`.  Note that `move c xy`\nis equivalent to the following two definitions:\n\n    move c x\n    move c y\n\nOn the other hand, `move c d` is a single instruction.  At runtime,\nthe `d` operand will be tested to see whether it refers to an X\nregister or a Y register, and a pointer to the register will be set\nup.\n\n#### The '?' type modifier ####\n\nThe character `?` can be added to the end of an operand to indicate\nthat the operand will not be used every time the instruction is executed.\nFor example:\n\n    allocate_heap t I t?\n    is_eq_exact f? x xy\n\nIn `allocate_heap`, the last operand is the number of live registers.\nIt will only be used if there is not enough heap space and a garbage\ncollection must be performed.\n\nIn `is_eq_exact`, the failure address (the first operand) will only be\nused if the two register operands are not equal.\n\nKnowing that an operand is not always used can improve how packing\nis done for some instructions.\n\nFor the `allocate_heap` instruction, without the `?` the packing would\nbe done like this:\n\n         +--------------------+--------------------+\n    I -> |       Stack needed | &&lb_allocate_heap +\n         +--------------------+--------------------+\n         |        Heap needed | Live registers     +\n         +--------------------+--------------------+\n\n\"Stack needed\" and \"Heap needed\" are always used, but they are in\ndifferent words.  Thus, at runtime the `allocate_heap` instruction\nmust read both words from memory even though it will not always use\n\"Live registers\".\n\nWith the `?`, the operands will be packed like this:\n\n         +--------------------+--------------------+\n    I -> |     Live registers | &&lb_allocate_heap +\n         +--------------------+--------------------+\n         |        Heap needed |       Stack needed +\n         +--------------------+--------------------+\n\nNow \"Stack needed\" and \"Heap needed\" are in the same word.","ref":"beam_makeops.html#defining-specific-instructions"},{"type":"extras","title":"Defining transformation rules ### - The beam_makeops script","doc":"Transformation rules are used to rewrite generic instructions to other\ngeneric instructions.  The transformations rules are applied\nrepeatedly until no rule match.  At that point, the first instruction\nin the resulting instruction sequence will be converted to a specific\ninstruction and added to the code for the module being loaded.  Then\nthe transformation rules for the remaining instructions are run in the\nsame way.\n\nA rule is recognized by its right-pointer arrow: `=>`.  To the left of\nthe arrow is one or more instruction patterns, separated by `|`.  To\nthe right of the arrow is zero or more instructions, separated by `|`.\nIf the instructions from the BEAM code matches the instruction\npatterns on the left-hand side, they will be replaced with\ninstructions on the right-hand side (or removed if there are no\ninstructions on the right).\n\n#### Defining instruction patterns ####\n\nWe will start looking at the patterns on the left-hand side of the arrow.\n\nA pattern for an instruction consists of its name, followed by a pattern\nfor each of its operands.  The operand patterns are separated by spaces.\n\nThe simplest possible pattern is a variable.  Just like in Erlang,\na variable must begin with an uppercase letter.  In constrast to Erlang,\nvariables must **not** be repeated.\n\nVariables that have been bound on the left-hand side can be used on\nthe right-hand side.  For example, this rule will rewrite all `move`\ninstructions to `assign` instructions with the operands swapped:\n\n    move Src Dst => assign Dst Src\n\nIf we only want to match operands of a certain type, we can\nuse a type constraint.  A type constraint consists of one or more\nlowercase letters, each specifying a type.  For example:\n\n    is_integer Fail an => jump Fail\n\nThe second operand pattern, `an`, will match if the second operand is\neither an atom or NIL (the empty list).  In case of a match, the\n`is_integer/2` instruction will be replaced with a `jump/1`\ninstruction.\n\nAn operand pattern can bind a variable and constrain the type at the\nsame time by following the variable with a `=` and the constraint.\nFor example:\n\n    is_eq_exact Fail=f R=xy C=q => i_is_eq_exact_literal Fail R C\n\nHere the `is_eq_exact` instruction is replaced with a specialized instruction\nthat only compares literals, but only if the first operand is a register and\nthe second operand is a literal.\n\n#### Removing instructions ####\n\nThe instructions of the left-hand side of the pattern can be removed\nby using the `_` symbol on the right-hand side of the\ntransformation. For example, a `line` instruction without any actual\nline-number information can be removed like this:\n\n    line n => _\n\n(Before OTP 25, this was instead achieved by leaving the right-hand side\nblank.)\n\n#### Further constraining patterns ####\n\nIn addition to specifying a type letter, the actual value for the type can\nbe specified.  For example:\n\n    move C=c x==1 => move_x1 C\n\nHere the second operand of `move` is constrained to be X register 1.\n\nWhen specifying an atom constraint, the atom is written as it would be\nin the C source code.  That is, it needs an `am_` prefix, and it must\nbe listed in `atom.names`.  For example, redundant `is_boolean` instructions\ncan be removed like this:\n\n    is_boolean Fail=f a==am_true => _\n    is_boolean Fail=f a==am_false => _\n\nThere are several constraints available for testing whether a call is to a BIF\nor a function.\n\nThe constraint `u$is_bif` will test whether the given operand refers to a BIF.\nFor example:\n\n    call_ext u Bif=u$is_bif => call_bif Bif\n    call_ext u Func         => i_call_ext Func\n\nThe `call_ext` instruction can be used to call functions written in\nErlang as well as BIFs (or more properly called SNIFs).  The\n`u$is_bif` constraint will match if the operand refers to a BIF (that\nis, if it is listed in the file `bif.tab`).  Note that `u$is_bif`\nshould only be applied to operands that are known to contain an index\nto the import table chunk in the BEAM file (such operands have the\ntype `b` or `e` in the corresponding specific instruction).  If\napplied to other `u` operands, it will at best return a nonsense\nresult.\n\nThe `u$is_not_bif` constraint matches if the operand does not refer to\na BIF (not listed in `bif.tab`).  For example:\n\n    move S X0=x==0 | line Loc | call_ext_last Ar Func=u$is_not_bif D =>\n         move S X0 | call_ext_last Ar Func D\n\nThe `u$bif:Module:Name/Arity` constraint tests whether the given\noperand refers to a specific BIF.  Note that `Module:Name/Arity`\n**must** be an existing BIF defined in `bif.tab`, or there will\nbe a compilation error.  It is useful when a call to a specific BIF\nshould be replaced with an instruction as in this example:\n\n    gc_bif2 Fail Live u$bif:erlang:splus/2 S1 S2 Dst =>\n         gen_plus Fail Live S1 S2 Dst\n\nHere the call to the GC BIF `'+'/2` will be replaced with the instruction\n`gen_plus/5`.  Note that the same name as used in the C source code must be\nused for the BIF, which in this case is `splus`.  It is defined like this\nin `bit.tab`:\n\n    ubif erlang:'+'/2 splus_2\n\nThe `u$func:Module:Name/Arity` will test whether the given operand is a\na specific function.  Here is an example:\n\n    bif1 Fail u$func:erlang:is_constant/1 Src Dst => too_old_compiler\n\n`is_constant/1` used to be a BIF a long time ago.  The transformation\nreplaces the call with the `too_old_compiler` instruction, which is\nspecially handled in the loader to produce a nicer error message than\nthe default error would be for a missing guard BIF.\n\n#### Type constraints allowed in patterns ####\n\nHere are all type letters that are allowed on the left-hand side of a\ntransformation rule.\n\n* `u` - An untagged integer that fits in a machine word.\n\n* `x` - X register.\n\n* `y` - Y register.\n\n* `l` - Floating point register number.\n\n* `i` - Tagged literal integer.\n\n* `a` - Tagged literal atom.\n\n* `n` - NIL (`[]`, the empty list).\n\n* `q` - Literals that don't fit in a word, such as list or tuples.\n\n* `f` - Non-zero failure label.\n\n* `p` - The zero failure label.\n\n* `j` - Any label.  Equivalent to `fp`.\n\n* `c` - Any literal term.  Equivalent to `ainq`.\n\n* `s` - X register, Y register, or any literal term.  Equivalent to `xyc`.\n\n* `d` - X or Y register.  Equivalent to `xy`.  (In a pattern `d` will\nmatch both source and destination registers.  As an operand in a specific\ninstruction, it must only be used for a destination register.)\n\n* `o` - Overflow.  An untagged integer that does not fit in a machine word.\n\n#### Predicates ####\n\nIf the constraints described so far is not enough, additional\nconstraints can be implemented in C and be called as a guard function\non the left-hand side of the transformation.  If the guard function returns\na non-zero value, the matching of the rule will continue, otherwise\nthe match will fail.  Such guard functions are hereafter called\n*predicates*.\n\nThe most commonly used guard constraints is `equal()`. It can be used\nto remove a redundant `move` instructio like this:\n\n    move R1 R2 | equal(R1, R2) => _\n\nor remove a redundant `is_eq_exact` instruction like this:\n\n    is_eq_exact Lbl Src1 Src2 | equal(Src1, Src2) => _\n\nAt the time of writing, all predicates are defined in files named\n`predicates.tab` in several directories.  In `predicates.tab` directly\nin `$ERL_TOP/erts/emulator/beam`, predicates that are used by both the\ntraditinal emulator and the JIT implementations are contained.\nPredicates only used by the emulator can be found in\n`emu/predicates.tab`.","ref":"beam_makeops.html#defining-transformation-rules"},{"type":"extras","title":"A very brief note on implementation of predicates #### - The beam_makeops script","doc":"It is outside the scope for this document to describe in detail how\npredicates are implemented because it requires knowledge of the\ninternal loader data structures, but here is quick look at the\nimplementation of a simple predicate called `literal_is_map()`.\n\nHere is first an example how it is used:\n\n   is_map Fail Lit=q | literal_is_map(Lit) => _\n\nIf the `Lit` operand is a literal, then the `literal_is_map()`\npredicate is called to determine whether it is a map literal.\nIf it is, the instruction is not needed and can be removed.\n\n`literal_is_map()` is implemented like this (in `emu/predicates.tab`):\n\n    pred.literal_is_map(Lit) {\n        Eterm term;\n\n        ASSERT(Lit.type == TAG_q);\n        term = beamfile_get_literal(&S->beam, Lit.val);\n        return is_map(term);\n    }\n\nThe `pred.` prefix tells **beam\\_makeops** that this function is a\npredicate.  Without the prefix, it would have been interpreted as the\nimplementation of an instruction (described in **Defining the\nimplementation**).\n\nPredicate functions have a magic variabled called `S`, which is a\npointer to a state struct. In the example,\n`beamfile_get_literal(&S->beam, Lit.val);` is used to retrieve the actual term\nfor the literal.\n\nAt the time of writing, the expanded C code generated by\n**beam\\_makeops** looks like this:\n\n    static int literal_is_map(LoaderState* S, BeamOpArg Lit) {\n      Eterm term;\n\n      ASSERT(Lit.type == TAG_q);\n      term = S->literals[Lit.val].term;\n      return is_map(term);;\n    }\n\n#### Handling instructions with variable number of operands ####\n\nSome instructions, such as `select_val/3`, essentially has a variable\nnumber of operands.  Such instructions have a `{list,[...]}` operand\nas their last operand in the BEAM assembly code.  For example:\n\n    {select_val,{x,0},\n                {f,1},\n                {list,[{atom,b},{f,4},{atom,a},{f,5}]}}.\n\nThe loader will convert a `{list,[...]}` operand to an `u` operand whose\nvalue is the number of elements in the list, followed by each element in\nthe list.  The instruction above would be translated to the following\ngeneric instruction:\n\n    {select_val,{x,0},{f,1},{u,4},{atom,b},{f,4},{atom,a},{f,5}}\n\nTo match a variable number of arguments we need to use the special\noperand type `*` like this:\n\n    select_val Src=aiq Fail=f Size=u List=* =>\n        i_const_select_val Src Fail Size List\n\nThis transformation renames a `select_val/3` instruction\nwith a constant source operand to `i_const_select_val/3`.\n\n#### Constructing new instructions on the right-hand side ####\n\nThe most common operand on the right-hand side is a variable that was\nbound while matching the pattern on the left-hand side.  For example:\n\n    trim N Remaining => i_trim N\n\nAn operand can also be a type letter to construct an operand of that\ntype.  Each type has a default value.  For example, the type `x` has\nthe default value 1023, which is the highest X register.  That makes\n`x` on the right-hand side a convenient shortcut for a temporary X\nregister.  For example:\n\n    is_number Fail Literal=q => move Literal x | is_number Fail x\n\nIf the second operand for `is_number/2` is a literal, it will be moved to\nX register 1023.  Then `is_number/2` will test whether the value stored in\nX register 1023 is a number.\n\nThis kind of transformation is useful when it is rare that an operand can\nbe anything else but a register.  In the case of `is_number/2`, the second\noperand is always a register unless the compiler optimizations have been\ndisabled.\n\nIf the default value is not suitable, the type letter can be followed\nby `=` and a value.  Most types take an integer value.  The value for\nan atom is written the same way as in the C source code.  For example,\nthe atom `false` is written as `am_false`.  The atom must be listed in\n`atom.names`.\n\nHere is an example showing how values can be specified:\n\n    bs_put_utf32 Fail=j Flags=u Src=s =>\n        i_bs_validate_unicode Fail Src |\n        bs_put_integer Fail i=32 u=1 Flags Src\n\n#### Type letters on the right-hand side ####\n\nHere follows all types that are allowed to be used in operands for\ninstructions being constructed on the right-hand side of a\ntransformation rule.\n\n* `u` - Construct an untagged integer.  The default value is 0.\n\n* `x` - X register.  The default value is 1023.  That makes `x` convenient to\nuse as a temporary X register.\n\n* `y` - Y register.  The default value is 0.\n\n* `l` - Floating point register number.  The default value is 0.\n\n* `i` - Tagged literal integer.  The default value is 0.\n\n* `a` - Tagged atom.  The default value is the empty atom (`am_Empty`).\n\n* `p` - Zero failure label.\n\n* `n` - NIL (`[]`, the empty list).\n\n#### Function call on the right-hand side ####\n\nTransformations that are not possible to describe with the rule\nlanguage as described here can be implemented as a generator function\nin C and called from the right-hand side of a transformation.  The left-hand\nside of the transformation will perform the match and bind operands to\nvariables.  The variables can then be passed to a generator function\non the right-hand side.  For example:\n\n    bif2 Fail=j u$bif:erlang:element/2 Index=s Tuple=xy Dst=d =>\n        element(Jump, Index, Tuple, Dst)\n\nThis transformation rule matches a call to the BIF `element/2`.\nThe operands will be captured and the generator function `element()` will\nbe called.\n\nThe `element()` generator will produce one of two instructions\ndepending on `Index`.  If `Index` is an integer in the range from 1 up\nto the maximum tuple size, the instruction `i_fast_element/2` will be\nproduced, otherwise the instruction `i_element/4` will be produced.\nThe corresponding specific instructions are:\n\n    i_fast_element xy j? I d\n    i_element xy j? s d\n\nThe `i_fast_element/2` instruction is faster because the tuple is\nalready an untagged integer.  It also knows that the index is at least\n1, so it does not have to test for that.  The `i_element/4`\ninstruction will have to fetch the index from a register, test that it\nis an integer, and untag the integer.\n\nAt the time of writing, all generators functions were defined in files\nnamed `generators.tab` in several directories (in the same directories\nas the `predicates.tab` files).\n\nIt is outside the scope of this document to describe in detail how\ngenerator functions are written, but here is the implementation of\n`element()`:\n\n    gen.element(Fail, Index, Tuple, Dst) {\n        BeamOp* op;\n\n        $NewBeamOp(S, op);\n\n        if (Index.type == TAG_i && Index.val > 0 &&\n            Index.val <= ERTS_MAX_TUPLE_SIZE &&\n            (Tuple.type == TAG_x || Tuple.type == TAG_y)) {\n            $BeamOpNameArity(op, i_fast_element, 4);\n            op->a[0] = Tuple;\n            op->a[1] = Fail;\n            op->a[2].type = TAG_u;\n            op->a[2].val = Index.val;\n            op->a[3] = Dst;\n        } else {\n            $BeamOpNameArity(op, i_element, 4);\n            op->a[0] = Tuple;\n            op->a[1] = Fail;\n            op->a[2] = Index;\n            op->a[3] = Dst;\n        }\n\n        return op;\n    }\n\nThe `gen.` prefix tells **beam\\_makeops** that this function is a\ngenerator.  Without the prefix, it would have been interpreted as the\nimplementation of an instruction (described in **Defining the\nimplementation**).\n\nGenerator functions have a magic variabled called `S`, which is a\npointer to a state struct.  In the example, `S` is used in the invocation\nof the `NewBeamOp` macro.","ref":"beam_makeops.html#a-very-brief-note-on-implementation-of-predicates"},{"type":"extras","title":"Defining the implementation ### - The beam_makeops script","doc":"For the traditional BEAM interpreter, the actual implementation of\ninstructions are also defined in `.tab` files processed by\n**beam\\_makeops**.  See [Code generation for\nBeamAsm](#code-generation-for-beamasm) for a brief introduction to\nhow code generation is done for BeamAsm.\n\nFor practical reasons, instruction definitions are stored in several\nfiles, at the time of writing in the following files (in the\n`beam/emu` directory):\n\n    bif_instrs.tab\n    arith_instrs.tab\n    bs_instrs.tab\n    float_instrs.tab\n    instrs.tab\n    map_instrs.tab\n    msg_instrs.tab\n    select_instrs.tab\n    trace_instrs.tab\n\nThere is also a file that only contains macro definitions:\n\n    macros.tab\n\nThe syntax of each file is similar to C code.  In fact, most of\nthe contents *is* C code, interspersed with macro invocations.\n\nTo allow Emacs to auto-indent the code, each file starts with the\nfollowing line:\n\n    // -*- c -*-\n\nTo avoid messing up the indentation, all comments are written\nas C++ style comments (`//`) instead of `#`.  Note that a comment\nmust start at the beginning of a line.\n\nThe meat of an instruction definition file are macro definitions.\nWe have seen this macro definition before:\n\n    move(Src, Dst) {\n        $Dst = $Src;\n    }\n\nA macro definitions must start at the beginning of the line (no spaces\nallowed), the opening curly bracket must be on the same line, and the\nfinishing curly bracket must be at the beginning of a line.  It is\nrecommended that the macro body is properly indented.\n\nAs a convention, the macro arguments in the head all start with an\nuppercase letter.  In the body, the macro arguments can be expanded\nby preceding them with `$`.\n\nA macro definition whose name and arity matches a family of\nspecific instructions is assumed to be the implementation of that\ninstruction.\n\nA macro can also be invoked from within another macro.  For example,\n`move_deallocate_return/2` avoids repeating code by invoking\n`$deallocate_return()` as a macro:\n\n    move_deallocate_return(Src, Deallocate) {\n        x(0) = $Src;\n        $deallocate_return($Deallocate);\n    }\n\nHere is the definition of `deallocate_return/1`:\n\n    deallocate_return(Deallocate) {\n        //| -no_next\n        int words_to_pop = $Deallocate;\n        SET_I((BeamInstr *) cp_val(*E));\n        E = ADD_BYTE_OFFSET(E, words_to_pop);\n        CHECK_TERM(x(0));\n        DispatchReturn;\n    }\n\nThe expanded code for `move_deallocate_return` will look this:\n\n    OpCase(move_deallocate_return_cQ):\n    {\n      x(0) = I[1];\n      do {\n        int words_to_pop = Qb(BeamExtraData(I[0]));\n        SET_I((BeamInstr *) cp_val(*E));\n        E = ADD_BYTE_OFFSET(E, words_to_pop);\n        CHECK_TERM(x(0));\n        DispatchReturn;\n      } while (0);\n    }\n\nWhen expanding macros, **beam\\_makeops** wraps the expansion in a\n`do`/`while` wrapper unless **beam\\_makeops** can clearly see that no\nwrapper is needed.  In this case, the wrapper is needed.\n\nNote that arguments for macros cannot be complex expressions, because\nthe arguments are split on `,`.  For example, the following would\nnot work because **beam\\_makeops** would split the expression into\ntwo arguments:\n\n    $deallocate_return(get_deallocation(y, $Deallocate));\n\n#### Code generation directives ####\n\nWithin macro definitions, `//` comments are in general not treated\nspecially.  They will be copied to the file with the generated code\nalong with the rest of code in the body.\n\nHowever, there is an exception. Within a macro definition, a line that\nstarts with whitespace followed by `//|` is treated specially.  The\nrest of the line is assumed to contain directives to control code\ngeneration.\n\nCurrently, two code generation directives are recognized:\n\n* `-no_prefetch`\n* `-no_next`\n\n##### The -no_prefetch directive #####\n\nTo see what `-no_prefetch` does, let's first look at the default code\ngeneration.  Here is the code generated for `move_cx`:\n\n    OpCase(move_cx):\n    {\n      BeamInstr next_pf = BeamCodeAddr(I[2]);\n      xb(BeamExtraData(I[0])) = I[1];\n      I += 2;\n      ASSERT(VALID_INSTR(next_pf));\n      GotoPF(next_pf);\n    }\n\nNote that the very first thing done is to fetch the address to the\nnext instruction.  The reason is that it usually improves performance.\n\nJust as a demonstration, we can add a `-no_prefetch` directive to\nthe `move/2` instruction:\n\n    move(Src, Dst) {\n        //| -no_prefetch\n        $Dst = $Src;\n    }\n\nWe can see that the prefetch is no longer done:\n\n    OpCase(move_cx):\n    {\n      xb(BeamExtraData(I[0])) = I[1];\n      I += 2;\n      ASSERT(VALID_INSTR(*I));\n      Goto(*I);\n    }\n\nWhen would we want to turn off the prefetch in practice?\n\nIn instructions that will not always execute the next instruction.\nFor example:\n\n    is_atom(Fail, Src) {\n        if (is_not_atom($Src)) {\n            $FAIL($Fail);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // From macros.tab\n    FAIL(Fail) {\n        //| -no_prefetch\n        $SET_I_REL($Fail);\n        Goto(*I);\n    }\n\n`is_atom/2` may either execute the next instruction (if the second\noperand is an atom) or branch to the failure label.\n\nThe generated code looks like this:\n\n    OpCase(is_atom_fx):\n    {\n      if (is_not_atom(xb(I[1]))) {\n        ASSERT(VALID_INSTR(*(I + (fb(BeamExtraData(I[0]))) + 0)));\n        I += fb(BeamExtraData(I[0])) + 0;;\n        Goto(*I);;\n      }\n      I += 2;\n      ASSERT(VALID_INSTR(*I));\n      Goto(*I);\n    }\n\n##### The -no_next directive #####\n\nNext we will look at when the `-no_next` directive can be used.  Here\nis the `jump/1` instruction:\n\n    jump(Fail) {\n        $JUMP($Fail);\n    }\n\n    // From macros.tab\n    JUMP(Fail) {\n        //| -no_next\n        $SET_I_REL($Fail);\n        Goto(*I);\n    }\n\nThe generated code looks like this:\n\n    OpCase(jump_f):\n    {\n      ASSERT(VALID_INSTR(*(I + (fb(BeamExtraData(I[0]))) + 0)));\n      I += fb(BeamExtraData(I[0])) + 0;;\n      Goto(*I);;\n    }\n\nIf we remove the `-no_next` directive, the code would look like this:\n\n    OpCase(jump_f):\n    {\n      BeamInstr next_pf = BeamCodeAddr(I[1]);\n      ASSERT(VALID_INSTR(*(I + (fb(BeamExtraData(I[0]))) + 0)));\n      I += fb(BeamExtraData(I[0])) + 0;;\n      Goto(*I);;\n      I += 1;\n      ASSERT(VALID_INSTR(next_pf));\n      GotoPF(next_pf);\n    }\n\nIn the end, the C compiler will probably optimize this code to the\nsame native code as the first version, but the first version is certainly\nmuch easier to read for human readers.\n\n#### Macros in the macros.tab file ####\n\nThe file `macros.tab` contains many useful macros.  When implementing\nnew instructions it is good practice to look through `macros.tab` to\nsee if any of existing macros can be used rather than re-inventing\nthe wheel.\n\nWe will describe a few of the most useful macros here.\n\n[](){: #the-GC_REGEXP-definition }\n\n##### The GC_REGEXP definition #####\n\nThe following line defines a regular expression that will recognize\na call to a function that does a garbage collection:\n\n     GC_REGEXP=erts_garbage_collect|erts_gc|GcBifFunction;\n\nThe purpose is that **beam\\_makeops** can verify that an instruction\nthat does a garbage collection and has an `d` operand uses the\n`$REFRESH_GEN_DEST()` macro.\n\nIf you need to define a new function that does garbage collection,\nyou should give it the prefix `erts_gc_`.  If that is not possible\nyou should update the regular expression so that it will match your\nnew function.\n\n##### FAIL(Fail) #####\n\nBranch to `$Fail`.  Will suppress prefetch (`-no_prefetch`).  Typical use:\n\n    is_nonempty_list(Fail, Src) {\n        if (is_not_list($Src)) {\n            $FAIL($Fail);\n        }\n    }\n\n##### JUMP(Fail) #####\n\nBranch to `$Fail`.  Suppresses generation of dispatch of the next\ninstruction (`-no_next`).  Typical use:\n\n    jump(Fail) {\n        $JUMP($Fail);\n    }\n\n##### GC_TEST(NeedStack, NeedHeap, Live) #####\n\n`$GC_TEST(NeedStack, NeedHeap, Live)` tests that given amount of\nstack space and heap space is available.  If not it will do a\ngarbage collection.  Typical use:\n\n    test_heap(Nh, Live) {\n        $GC_TEST(0, $Nh, $Live);\n    }\n\n##### AH(NeedStack, NeedHeap, Live) #####\n\n`AH(NeedStack, NeedHeap, Live)` allocates a stack frame and\noptionally additional heap space.\n\n#### Pre-defined macros and variables ####\n\n**beam\\_makeops** defines several built-in macros and pre-bound variables.\n\n##### The NEXT_INSTRUCTION pre-bound variable #####\n\nThe NEXT\\_INSTRUCTION is a pre-bound variable that is available in\nall instructions.  It expands to the address of the next instruction.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n    i_call(CallDest) {\n        //| -no_next\n        $SAVE_CONTINUATION_POINTER($NEXT_INSTRUCTION);\n        $DISPATCH_REL($CallDest);\n    }\n\nWhen calling a function, the return address is first stored in `E[0]`\n(using the `$SAVE_CONTINUATION_POINTER()` macro), and then control is\ntransferred to the callee.  Here is the generated code:\n\n    OpCase(i_call_f):\n    {\n        ASSERT(VALID_INSTR(*(I+2)));\n        *E = (BeamInstr) (I+2);;\n\n        /* ... dispatch code intentionally left out ... */\n    }\n\nWe can see that that `$NEXT_INSTRUCTION` has been expanded to `I+2`.\nThat makes sense since the size of the `i_call_f/1` instruction is\ntwo words.\n\n##### The IP_ADJUSTMENT pre-bound variable #####\n\n`$IP_ADJUSTMENT` is usually 0.  In a few combined instructions\n(described below) it can be non-zero.  It is used like this\nin `macros.tab`:\n\n    SET_I_REL(Offset) {\n        ASSERT(VALID_INSTR(*(I + ($Offset) + $IP_ADJUSTMENT)));\n        I += $Offset + $IP_ADJUSTMENT;\n    }\n\nAvoid using `IP_ADJUSTMENT` directly.  Use `SET_I_REL()` or\none of the macros that invoke such as `FAIL()` or `JUMP()`\ndefined in `macros.tab`.\n\n#### Pre-defined macro functions ####\n\n##### The IF() macro #####\n\n`$IF(Expr, IfTrue, IfFalse)` evaluates `Expr`, which must be a valid\nPerl expression (which for simple numeric expressions have the same\nsyntax as C).  If `Expr` evaluates to 0, the entire `IF()` expression will be\nreplaced with `IfFalse`, otherwise it will be replaced with `IfTrue`.\n\nSee the description of `OPERAND_POSITION()` for an example.\n\n##### The OPERAND\\_POSITION() macro #####\n\n`$OPERAND_POSITION(Expr)` returns the position for `Expr`, if\n`Expr` is an operand that is not packed.  The first operand is\nat position 1.\n\nReturns 0 otherwise.\n\nThis macro could be used like this in order to share code:\n\n    FAIL(Fail) {\n        //| -no_prefetch\n        $IF($OPERAND_POSITION($Fail) == 1 && $IP_ADJUSTMENT == 0,\n            goto common_jump,\n            $DO_JUMP($Fail));\n    }\n\n    DO_JUMP(Fail) {\n        $SET_I_REL($Fail);\n        Goto(*I));\n    }\n\n    // In beam_emu.c:\n    common_jump:\n       I += I[1];\n       Goto(*I));\n\n\n#### The $REFRESH\\_GEN\\_DEST() macro ####\n\nWhen a specific instruction has a `d` operand, early during execution\nof the instruction, a pointer will be initialized to point to the X or\nY register in question.\n\nIf there is a garbage collection before the result is stored,\nthe stack will move and if the `d` operand referred to a Y\nregister, the pointer will no longer be valid.  (Y registers are\nstored on the stack.)\n\nIn those circumstances, `$REFRESH_GEN_DEST()` must be invoked\nto set up the pointer again. **beam\\_makeops** will notice\nif there is a call to a function that does a garbage collection and\n`$REFRESH_GEN_DEST()` is not called.\n\nHere is a complete example.  The `new_map` instruction is defined\nlike this:\n\n    new_map d t I\n\nIt is implemented like this:\n\n    new_map(Dst, Live, N) {\n        Eterm res;\n\n        HEAVY_SWAPOUT;\n        res = erts_gc_new_map(c_p, reg, $Live, $N, $NEXT_INSTRUCTION);\n        HEAVY_SWAPIN;\n        $REFRESH_GEN_DEST();\n        $Dst = res;\n        $NEXT($NEXT_INSTRUCTION+$N);\n    }\n\nIf we have forgotten the `$REFRESH_GEN_DEST()` there would be a message\nsimilar to this:\n\n    pointer to destination register is invalid after GC -- use $REFRESH_GEN_DEST()\n    ... from the body of new_map at beam/map_instrs.tab(30)\n\n#### Variable number of operands ####\n\nHere follows an example of how to handle an instruction with a variable number\nof operands for the interpreter.  Here is the instruction definition in `emu/ops.tab`:\n\n    put_tuple2 xy I *\n\nFor the interpreter, the `*` is optional, because it does not effect code generation\nin any way. However, it is recommended to include it to make it clear for human readers\nthat there is a variable number of operands.\n\nUse the `$NEXT_INSTRUCTION` macro to obtain a pointer to the first of the variable\noperands.\n\nHere is the implementation:\n\n    put_tuple2(Dst, Arity) {\n\tEterm* hp = HTOP;\n\tEterm arity = $Arity;\n\tEterm* dst_ptr = &($Dst);\n\n\t//| -no_next\n\tASSERT(arity != 0);\n\t*hp++ = make_arityval(arity);\n\n\t/*\n\t * The $NEXT_INSTRUCTION macro points just beyond the fixed\n\t * operands. In this case it points to the descriptor of\n\t * the first element to be put into the tuple.\n\t */\n\tI = $NEXT_INSTRUCTION;\n\tdo {\n\t    Eterm term = *I++;\n\t    switch (loader_tag(term)) {\n\t    case LOADER_X_REG:\n\t\t*hp++ = x(loader_x_reg_index(term));\n\t\tbreak;\n\t    case LOADER_Y_REG:\n\t\t*hp++ = y(loader_y_reg_index(term));\n\t\tbreak;\n\t    default:\n\t\t*hp++ = term;\n\t\tbreak;\n\t    }\n\t} while (--arity != 0);\n\t*dst_ptr = make_tuple(HTOP);\n\tHTOP = hp;\n\tASSERT(VALID_INSTR(* (Eterm *)I));\n\tGoto(*I);\n    }\n\n\n#### Combined instructions ####\n\n**Problem**: For frequently executed instructions we want to use\n\"fast\" operands types such as `x` and `y`, as opposed to `s` or `S`.\nTo avoid an explosion in code size, we want to share most of the\nimplementation between the instructions.  Here are the specific\ninstructions for `i_increment/5`:\n\n    i_increment r W t d\n    i_increment x W t d\n    i_increment y W t d\n\nThe `i_increment` instruction is implemented like this:\n\n    i_increment(Source, IncrementVal, Live, Dst) {\n        Eterm increment_reg_source = $Source;\n        Eterm increment_val = $IncrementVal;\n        Uint live;\n        Eterm result;\n\n        if (ERTS_LIKELY(is_small(increment_reg_val))) {\n            Sint i = signed_val(increment_reg_val) + increment_val;\n            if (ERTS_LIKELY(IS_SSMALL(i))) {\n                $Dst = make_small(i);\n                $NEXT0();\n            }\n        }\n        live = $Live;\n        HEAVY_SWAPOUT;\n        reg[live] = increment_reg_val;\n        reg[live+1] = make_small(increment_val);\n        result = erts_gc_mixed_plus(c_p, reg, live);\n        HEAVY_SWAPIN;\n        ERTS_HOLE_CHECK(c_p);\n        if (ERTS_LIKELY(is_value(result))) {\n            $REFRESH_GEN_DEST();\n            $Dst = result;\n            $NEXT0();\n        }\n        ASSERT(c_p->freason != BADMATCH || is_value(c_p->fvalue));\n        goto find_func_info;\n    }\n\nThere will be three almost identical copies of the code.  Given the\nsize of the code, that could be too high cost to pay.\n\nTo avoid the three copies of the code, we could use only one specific\ninstruction:\n\n    i_increment S W t d\n\n(The same implementation as above will work.)\n\nThat reduces the code size, but is slower because `S` means that\nthere will be extra code to test whether the operand refers to an X\nregister or a Y register.\n\n**Solution**: We can use \"combined instructions\".  Combined\ninstructions are combined from instruction fragments.  The\nbulk of the code can be shared.\n\nHere we will show how `i_increment` can be implemented as a combined\ninstruction.  We will show each individual fragment first, and then\nshow how to connect them together.  First we will need a variable that\nwe can store the value fetched from the register in:\n\n    increment.head() {\n        Eterm increment_reg_val;\n    }\n\nThe name `increment` is the name of the group that the fragment\nbelongs to.  Note that it does not need to have the same\nname as the instruction.  The group name is followed by `.` and\nthe name of the fragment.  The name `head` is pre-defined.\nThe code in it will be placed at the beginning of a block, so\nthat all fragments in the group can access it.\n\nNext we define the fragment that will pick up the value from the\nregister from the first operand:\n\n    increment.fetch(Src) {\n        increment_reg_val = $Src;\n    }\n\nWe call this fragment `fetch`.  This fragment will be duplicated three\ntimes, one for each value of the first operand (`r`, `x`, and `y`).\n\nNext we define the main part of the code that do the actual incrementing.\n\n    increment.execute(IncrementVal, Live, Dst) {\n        Eterm increment_val = $IncrementVal;\n        Uint live;\n        Eterm result;\n\n        if (ERTS_LIKELY(is_small(increment_reg_val))) {\n            Sint i = signed_val(increment_reg_val) + increment_val;\n            if (ERTS_LIKELY(IS_SSMALL(i))) {\n                $Dst = make_small(i);\n                $NEXT0();\n            }\n        }\n        live = $Live;\n        HEAVY_SWAPOUT;\n        reg[live] = increment_reg_val;\n        reg[live+1] = make_small(increment_val);\n        result = erts_gc_mixed_plus(c_p, reg, live);\n        HEAVY_SWAPIN;\n        ERTS_HOLE_CHECK(c_p);\n        if (ERTS_LIKELY(is_value(result))) {\n            $REFRESH_GEN_DEST();\n            $Dst = result;\n            $NEXT0();\n        }\n        ASSERT(c_p->freason != BADMATCH || is_value(c_p->fvalue));\n        goto find_func_info;\n    }\n\nWe call this fragment `execute`.  It will handle the three remaining\noperands (`W t d`).  There will only be one copy of this fragment.\n\nNow that we have defined the fragments, we need to inform\n**beam\\_makeops** how they should be connected:\n\n    i_increment := increment.fetch.execute;\n\nTo the left of the `:=` is the name of the specific instruction that\nshould be implemented by the fragments, in this case `i_increment`.\nTo the right of `:=` is the name of the group with the fragments,\nfollowed by a `.`.  Then the name of the fragments in the group are\nlisted in the order they should be executed.  Note that the `head`\nfragment is not listed.\n\nThe line ends in `;` (to avoid messing up the indentation in Emacs).\n\n(Note that in practice the `:=` line is usually placed before the\nfragments.)\n\nThe generated code looks like this:\n\n    {\n      Eterm increment_reg_val;\n      OpCase(i_increment_rWtd):\n      {\n        increment_reg_val = r(0);\n      }\n      goto increment__execute;\n\n      OpCase(i_increment_xWtd):\n      {\n        increment_reg_val = xb(BeamExtraData(I[0]));\n      }\n      goto increment__execute;\n\n      OpCase(i_increment_yWtd):\n      {\n        increment_reg_val = yb(BeamExtraData(I[0]));\n      }\n      goto increment__execute;\n\n      increment__execute:\n      {\n        // Here follows the code from increment.execute()\n        .\n        .\n        .\n    }\n\n##### Some notes about combined instructions #####\n\nThe operands that are different must be at\nthe beginning of the instruction.  All operands in the last\nfragment must have the same operands in all variants of\nthe specific instruction.\n\nAs an example, the following specific instructions cannot be\nimplemented as a combined instruction:\n\n    i_times j? t x x d\n    i_times j? t x y d\n    i_times j? t s s d\n\nWe would have to change the order of the operands so that the\ntwo operands that are different are placed first:\n\n    i_times x x j? t d\n    i_times x y j? t d\n    i_times s s j? t d\n\nWe can then define:\n\n    i_times := times.fetch.execute;\n\n    times.head {\n        Eterm op1, op2;\n    }\n\n    times.fetch(Src1, Src2) {\n        op1 = $Src1;\n        op2 = $Src2;\n    }\n\n    times.execute(Fail, Live, Dst) {\n        // Multiply op1 and op2.\n        .\n        .\n        .\n    }\n\nSeveral instructions can share a group.  As an example, the following\ninstructions have different names, but in the end they all create a\nbinary.  The last two operands are common for all of them:\n\n    i_bs_init_fail       xy j? t? x\n    i_bs_init_fail_heap s I j? t? x\n    i_bs_init                W t? x\n    i_bs_init_heap         W I t? x\n\nThe instructions are defined like this (formatted with extra\nspaces for clarity):\n\n    i_bs_init_fail_heap := bs_init . fail_heap . verify . execute;\n    i_bs_init_fail      := bs_init . fail      . verify . execute;\n    i_bs_init           := bs_init .           .  plain . execute;\n    i_bs_init_heap      := bs_init .               heap . execute;\n\nNote that the first two instruction have three fragments, while the\nother two only have two fragments.  Here are the fragments:\n\n    bs_init_bits.head() {\n        Eterm num_bits_term;\n        Uint num_bits;\n        Uint alloc;\n    }\n\n    bs_init_bits.plain(NumBits) {\n        num_bits = $NumBits;\n        alloc = 0;\n    }\n\n    bs_init_bits.heap(NumBits, Alloc) {\n        num_bits = $NumBits;\n        alloc = $Alloc;\n    }\n\n    bs_init_bits.fail(NumBitsTerm) {\n        num_bits_term = $NumBitsTerm;\n        alloc = 0;\n    }\n\n    bs_init_bits.fail_heap(NumBitsTerm, Alloc) {\n        num_bits_term = $NumBitsTerm;\n        alloc = $Alloc;\n    }\n\n    bs_init_bits.verify(Fail) {\n        // Verify the num_bits_term, fail using $FAIL\n        // if there is a problem.\n\t.\n\t.\n\t.\n    }\n\n    bs_init_bits.execute(Live, Dst) {\n       // Long complicated code to a create a binary.\n       .\n       .\n       .\n    }\n\nThe full definitions of those instructions can be found in `bs_instrs.tab`.\nThe generated code can be found in `beam_warm.h`.","ref":"beam_makeops.html#defining-the-implementation"},{"type":"extras","title":"Code generation for BeamAsm ### - The beam_makeops script","doc":"For the BeamAsm runtime system, the implementation of each instruction is defined\nby emitter functions written in C++ that emit the assembly code for each instruction.\nThere is one emitter function for each family of specific instructions.\n\nTake for example the `move` instruction. In `beam/asm/ops.tab` there is a\nsingle specific instruction for `move` defined like this:\n\n    move s d\n\nThe implementation is found in `beam/asm/instr_common.cpp`:\n\n    void BeamModuleAssembler::emit_move(const ArgVal &Src, const ArgVal &Dst) {\n        mov_arg(Dst, Src);\n    }\n\nThe `mov_arg()` helper function will handle all combinations of source and destination\noperands.  For example, the instruction `{move,{x,1},{y,1}}` will be translated like this:\n\n    mov rdi, qword [rbx+8]\n    mov qword [rsp+8], rdi\n\nwhile `{move,{integer,42},{x,0}}` will be translated like this:\n\n    mov qword [rbx], 687\n\nIt is possible to define more than one specific instruction, but there will still be\nonly one emitter function. For example:\n\n    fload S l\n    fload q l\n\nBy defining `fload` like this, the source operand must be a X register, Y register, or\na literal.  If not, the loading will be aborted.  If the instruction instead had been\ndefined like this:\n\n    fload s l\n\nattempting to load an invalid instruction such as `{fload,{atom,clearly_bad},{fr,0}}`\nwould cause a crash (either at load time or when the instruction was executed).\n\nRegardless on how many specific instructions there are in the family,\nonly a single `emit_fload()` function is allowed:\n\n    void BeamModuleAssembler::emit_fload(const ArgVal &Src, const ArgVal &Dst) {\n        .\n        .\n        .\n    }\n\n[](){: #handling-a-variable-number-of-operands }\n\n#### Handling a variable number of operands ####\n\nHere follows an example of how an instruction with a variable number\nof operands could be handled.  One such instructions is\n`select_val/3`. Here is an example how it can look like in BEAM code:\n\n    {select_val,{x,0},\n                {f,1},\n                {list,[{atom,b},{f,4},{atom,a},{f,5}]}}.\n\nThe loader will convert a `{list,[...]}` operand to an `u` operand whose\nvalue is the number of elements in the list, followed by each element in\nthe list.  The instruction above would be translated to the following\ninstruction:\n\n    {select_val,{x,0},{f,1},{u,4},{atom,b},{f,4},{atom,a},{f,5}}\n\nA definition of a specific instruction for that instruction would look\nlike this:\n\n    select_val s f I *\n\nThe `*` as the last operand will make sure that the variable operands\nare passed in as a `Span` of `ArgVal` (will be `std::span` in C++20 onwards).\nHere is the emitter function:\n\n    void BeamModuleAssembler::emit_select_val(const ArgVal &Src,\n                                              const ArgVal &Fail,\n                                              const ArgVal &Size,\n                                              const Span  &args) {\n        ASSERT(Size.getValue() == args.size());\n           .\n           .\n           .\n    }","ref":"beam_makeops.html#code-generation-for-beamasm"}],"proglang":"erlang","content_type":"text/markdown","producer":{"name":"ex_doc","version":"0.37.3"}}
