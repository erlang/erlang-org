This configuration file must\nhave a double extension `\".set.asn1\"` (`\".asn1\"` can alternatively be\n`\".asn\"` or `\".py\"`). If the input files are `File1.asn1`,\n`File2.asn1`, and `File3.asn1`, the configuration file should look as\nfollows:\n\n```text\nFile1.asn1\nFile2.asn1\nFile3.asn1\n```\n\nThe output files in this case get their names from the configuration file. If\nthe configuration file is named `SetOfFiles.set.asn1`, the names of the output\nfiles are `SetOfFiles.hrl, SetOfFiles.erl, and SetOfFiles.asn1db`.\n\nSometimes in a system of `ASN.1` modules, different modules can have\ndifferent default tag modes, for example, one uses `AUTOMATIC` and\nanother `IMPLICIT`.  The multi-file compilation resolves the default\ntagging as if the modules were compiled separately.\n\nName collisions is an unwanted effect that can occur in multi-file\ncompilation. The compiler solves this problem in one of two ways:\n\n- If the definitions are identical, the output module keeps only one definition\n  with the original name.\n- If the definitions have the same name and differs in the definition, they are\n  renamed. The new names are the definition name and the original module name\n  concatenated.\n\nIf a name collision occurs, the compiler reports a `\"NOTICE: ...\"` message that\ntells if a definition was renamed, and the new name that must be used to\nencode/decode data.\n\n`Options` is a list with options specific for the ASN.1 compiler and options\nthat are applied to the Erlang compiler. The ASN.1 compiler passes on any\nunrecognized options to the Erlang compiler. The available options are as follows:\n\n- **`ber | per | uper | jer`** - The encoding rule to be used. The\n  supported encoding rules are Basic Encoding Rules (`ber`), Packed\n  Encoding Rules (`per`) aligned, PER unaligned (`uper`), and JSON\n  Encoding Rules (`jer`). The `jer` option can be used by itself to\n  generate a module that only supports encoding/decoding of JER, or it\n  can be used as a supplementary option to `ber`, `per`, and `uper`,\n  in which case a module that handles both the main encoding rules and\n  JER will be generated. In that case, the exported functions for JER\n  will be `jer_encode(Type, Value)` and `jer_decode(Type, Bytes)`.\n\n  JER (ITU-T X.697) are experimental in OTP 22. There is support for a\n  subset of the X.697 standard, for example there is no support for:\n\n  - JER encoding instructions\n  - the REAL type\n\n  > #### Change {: .info }\n  >\n  > In Erlang/OTP 27 and later, module `m:json` in STDLIB is used for\n  > encoding and decoding JSON. Before Erlang/OTP 27, it was necessary\n  > to provide an external JSON library.\n\n  If the encoding rule option is omitted, `ber` is the default.\n\n  The generated Erlang module always gets the same name as the ASN.1 module.\n  Therefore, only one encoding rule per ASN.1 module can be used at runtime.\n\n- **`der`** - With this option the Distinguished Encoding Rules (`der`) is\n  chosen. DER is regarded as a specialized variant of the BER encoding rule.\n  Therefore, this option only makes sense together with option `ber`. This\n  option sometimes adds sorting and value checks when encoding, which implies\n  slower encoding. The decoding routines are the same as for `ber`.\n\n- **`maps`** - This option changes the representation of the types `SEQUENCE`\n  and `SET` to use maps (instead of records). This option also suppresses the\n  generation of `.hrl` files.\n\n  For details, see section\n  [Map representation for SEQUENCE and SET](asn1_getting_started.md#MAP_SEQ_SET)\n  in the User's Guide.\n\n- **`compact_bit_string`** - The `BIT STRING` type is decoded to \"compact\n  notation\".\n\n  **This option is not recommended for new code.**\n\n  For details, see section [BIT STRING](asn1_getting_started.md#bit-string) in\n  the User's Guide.\n\n  This option implies option `legacy_erlang_types`, and it cannot be combined\n  with option `maps`.\n\n- **`legacy_bit_string`** - The `BIT STRING` type is decoded to the legacy\n  format, that is, a list of zeroes and ones.\n\n  **This option is not recommended for new code.**\n\n  For details, see section [BIT STRING](asn1_getting_started.md#bit-string) in\n  the User's Guide\n\n  This option implies option `legacy_erlang_types`, and it cannot be combined\n  with option `maps`.\n\n- **`legacy_erlang_types`** - Use the same Erlang types to represent\n  `BIT STRING` and `OCTET STRING` as in Erlang/OTP R16.\n\n  **This option is not recommended for new code.**\n\n  For details, see section [BIT STRING](asn1_getting_started.md#bit-string) and\n  section [OCTET STRING](asn1_getting_started.md#octet-string) in the User's\n  Guide.\n\n  This option cannot be combined with option `maps`.\n\n- **`{n2n, EnumTypeName}`** - Tells the compiler to generate functions for\n  conversion between names (as atoms) and numbers and conversely for the\n  specified `EnumTypeName`. There can be multiple occurrences of this option to\n  specify several type names. The type names must be declared as `ENUMERATIONS`\n  in the ASN.1 specification.\n\n  If `EnumTypeName` does not exist in the ASN.1 specification, the compilation\n  stops with an error code.\n\n  The generated conversion functions are named `name2num_EnumTypeName/1` and\n  `num2name_EnumTypeName/1`.\n\n- **`noobj`** - Do not compile (that is, do not produce object code) the\n  generated `.erl` file. If this option is omitted, the generated Erlang module\n  is compiled.\n\n- **`{i, IncludeDir}`** - Adds `IncludeDir` to the search-path for `.asn1db` and\n  ASN.1 source files. The compiler tries to open an `.asn1db` file when a\n  module imports definitions from another ASN.1 module. If no `.asn1db` file\n  is found, the ASN.1 source file is parsed. Several `{i, IncludeDir}` can be\n  given.\n\n- **`{outdir, Dir}`** - Specifies directory `Dir` where all generated files are\n  to be placed. If this option is omitted, the files are placed in the current\n  directory.\n\n- **`asn1config`** - When using one of the specialized decodes, exclusive or\n  selective decode, instructions must be given in a configuration file. Option\n  `asn1config` enables specialized decodes and takes the configuration file in\n  concern. The configuration file has the same name as the ASN.1 specification,\n  but with extension `.asn1config`.\n\n  For instructions for exclusive decode, see section\n  [Exclusive Decode](asn1_spec.md#Exclusive-Instruction) in the User's Guide.\n\n  For instructions for selective decode, see section\n  [Selective Decode](asn1_spec.md#Selective-Instruction) in the User's Guide.\n\n- **`undec_rest`** - By default when decoding, any bytes following the\n  end of an ASN.1 data structure are discarded. If an ASN.1 module is\n  compiled with option `undec_rest`, the decode function returns a\n  tuple `{ok, Value, Rest}`, where `Rest` is the bytes following the ASN.1\n  data structure. `Rest` can be a list or a binary.\n\n- **`no_ok_wrapper`** - With this option, the generated `encode/2` and\n  `decode/2` functions do not wrap a successful return value in an `{ok,...}`\n  tuple. If any error occurs, an exception will be raised.\n\n- **`{macro_name_prefix, Prefix}`** - All macro names generated by the compiler\n  are prefixed with `Prefix`. This is useful when multiple protocols that\n  contain macros with identical names are included in a single module.\n\n- **`{record_name_prefix, Prefix}`** - All record names generated by the\n  compiler are prefixed with `Prefix`. This is useful when multiple protocols\n  that contain records with identical names are included in a single module.\n\n- **`verbose`** - Causes more verbose information from the compiler describing\n  what it is doing.\n\n- **`warnings_as_errors`** - Causes warnings to be treated as errors.\n\n- **`deterministic`** - Causes all non-deterministic options to be stripped from\n  the `-asn1_info()` attribute.\n\nUnrecognized options are passed on to the Erlang compiler when the generated\n`.erl` file is compiled.\n\nThe compiler generates the following files:\n\n- `Asn1Module.hrl` (if any `SET` or `SEQUENCE` is defined)\n- `Asn1Module.erl` \\- Erlang module with encode, decode, and value functions\n- `Asn1Module.asn1db` \\- Intermediate format used by the compiler when modules\n  `IMPORT` definitions from each other.","ref":"asn1ct.html#compile/2"},{"type":"function","title":"asn1ct.test/1","doc":"Tests encoding and decoding of all types in `Module`.\n\nFor more details, see `test/3`.","ref":"asn1ct.html#test/1"},{"type":"function","title":"asn1ct.test/2","doc":"Tests encoding and decoding of `Module`.\n\nIf the second argument is given as atom `Type`, that type is tested.\n\nIf the second argument is given as list `Options`, that are the options\nthat are used for testing all types in the module.\n\nFor more details, see `test/3`.","ref":"asn1ct.html#test/2"},{"type":"function","title":"asn1ct.test/3","doc":"Performs a test of encode and decode of types in `Module`.\n\nThe generated functions are called by this function.

The ASN.1 compiler checks that\nthe syntax is correct and that the text represents proper ASN.1 code before\ngenerating an abstract syntax tree. The code generator then uses the abstract\nsyntax tree to generate code.\n\nThe generated Erlang files are placed in the current directory or in the\ndirectory specified with option `{outdir,Dir}`.\n\nThe compiler can be called from the Erlang shell like this:\n\n```erlang\n1> asn1ct:compile(\"People\", [ber]).\nok\n```\n\nOption `verbose` can be added to get information about the generated files:\n\n```erlang\n2> asn1ct:compile(\"People\", [ber,verbose]).\nErlang ASN.1 compiling \"People.asn\"\n--{generated,\"People.asn1db\"}--\n--{generated,\"People.hrl\"}--\n--{generated,\"People.erl\"}--\nok\n```\n\nASN.1 module `People` is now accepted and the abstract syntax tree is saved in\nfile `People.asn1db`. The generated Erlang code is compiled using the Erlang\ncompiler and loaded into the Erlang runtime system. There is now an API for\n`encode/2` and `decode/2` in module `People`, which is called like this:\n\n```\n'People':encode( ,  )\n```\n\nor:\n\n```\n'People':decode( ,  )\n```\n\nAssume that there is a network application that receives instances of the ASN.1\ndefined type `Person`, modifies, and sends them back again:\n\n```erlang\nreceive\n   {Port,{data,Bytes}} ->\n       case 'People':decode('Person',Bytes) of\n           {ok,P} ->\n               {ok,Answer} = 'People':encode('Person',mk_answer(P)),\n               Port ! {self(),{command,Answer}};\n           {error,Reason} ->\n               exit({error,Reason})\n       end\n    end,\n```\n\nIn this example, a series of bytes is received from an external source and the\nbytes are then decoded into a valid Erlang term. This was achieved with the call\n`'People':decode('Person',Bytes)`, which returned an Erlang value of the ASN.1\ntype `Person`. Then an answer was constructed and encoded using\n`'People':encode('Person',Answer)`, which takes an instance of a defined ASN.1\ntype and transforms it to a binary according to the BER or PER encoding rules.\n\nThe encoder and decoder can also be run from the shell:\n\n```erlang\n2> Rockstar = {'Person',\"Some Name\",roving,50}.\n{'Person',\"Some Name\",roving,50}\n3> {ok,Bin} = 'People':encode('Person',Rockstar).\n{ok,<<243,17,19,9,83,111,109,101,32,78,97,109,101,2,1,2,\n      2,1,50>>}\n4> {ok,Person} = 'People':decode('Person',Bin).\n{ok,{'Person',\"Some Name\",roving,50}}\n```","ref":"asn1_getting_started.html#example"},{"type":"extras","title":"Module Dependencies - Getting Started","doc":"It is common that ASN.1 modules import defined types, values, and other entities\nfrom another ASN.1 module.\n\nEarlier versions of the ASN.1 compiler required that modules that were imported\nfrom had to be compiled before the module that imported.

If omitted, `ber`\n  is the default.\n\n- **`-o OutDirectory`** - Where to put the generated files. Default is the\n  current directory.\n\n- **`-I IncludeDir`** - Where to search for `.asn1db` files and ASN.1 source\n  specs to resolve references to other modules. This option can be repeated many\n  times if there are several places to search in. The compiler searches the\n  current directory first.\n\n- **`+der`** - DER encoding rule. Only when using option `-bber`.\n\n- **`+jer`** - Functions `jer_encode/2` and `jer_decode/2` for JSON encoding\n  rules are generated together with functions for `ber` or `per`. Only to be\n  used when the main encoding option is `-bber`, `-bper` or `-buper`.\n\n- **`+maps`** - Use maps instead of records to represent the `SEQUENCE` and\n  `SET` types. No `.hrl` files will be generated. See the section\n  [Map representation for SEQUENCE and SET](asn1_getting_started.md#MAP_SEQ_SET)\n  for more information.\n\n- **`+asn1config`** - This functionality works together with option `ber`. It\n  enables the specialized decodes, see section\n  [Specialized Decode](asn1_spec.md).\n\n- **`+undec_rest`** - A buffer that holds a message being decoded can also have\n  trailing bytes. If those trailing bytes are important, they can be returned\n  along with the decoded value by compiling the ASN.1 specification with option\n  `+undec_rest`. The return value from the decoder is `{ok,Value,Rest}` where\n  `Rest` is a binary containing the trailing bytes.\n\n- **`+'Any Erlc Option'`** - Any option can be added to the Erlang compiler when\n  compiling the generated Erlang files. Any option unrecognized by the ASN.1\n  compiler is passed to the Erlang compiler.\n\nFor a complete description of `erlc`, see ERTS Reference Manual.\n\nThe compiler and other compile-time functions can also be started from the\nErlang shell. Here follows a brief description of the primary functions. For a\ncomplete description of each function, see module `asn1ct` in the\n[ASN.1 Reference Manual](`m:asn1ct`).\n\nThe compiler is started by `asn1ct:compile/1` with default options, or\n`asn1ct:compile/2` if explicit options are given.\n\nExample:\n\n```text\nasn1ct:compile(\"H323-MESSAGES\").\n```\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n\n```text\nasn1ct:compile(\"H323-MESSAGES\", [ber]).\n```\n\nIf PER encoding is wanted:\n\n```text\nasn1ct:compile(\"H323-MESSAGES\", [per]).\n```\n\nThe generic encode and decode functions can be called as follows:\n\n```text\n'H323-MESSAGES':encode('SomeChoiceType', {call,<<\"octetstring\">>}).\n'H323-MESSAGES':decode('SomeChoiceType', Bytes).\n```","ref":"asn1_getting_started.html#compile-time-functions"},{"type":"extras","title":"Runtime Functions - Getting Started","doc":"When an ASN.1 specification is compiled with option `ber`, the `asn1rt_nif`\nmodule and the NIF library in `asn1/priv_dir` are needed at runtime.\n\nBy calling function `info/0` in a generated module, you get information about\nwhich compiler options were used.","ref":"asn1_getting_started.html#runtime-functions"},{"type":"extras","title":"Special Decode Functionality for JSON Encoding Rules (JER) - Getting Started","doc":"When using the JSON encoding rules, it is possible to call the\n`decode/2` function in the following way with data that has already\nbeen decoded by `json:decode/1`:\n\n```erlang\nSomeModule:decode(Type, {json_decoded, Decoded}).\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```erlang\n1> asn1ct:compile(\"People\", [jer]).\nok\n2> Rockstar = {'Person',\"Vince Eclipse\",roving,50}.\n{'Person',\"Vince Eclipse\",roving,50}\n3> {ok,Bin} = 'People':encode('Person', Rockstar).\n{ok,<<\"{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Vince Eclipse\\\",\\\"location\\\":2,\\\"age\\\":50}\">>}\n4> 'People':decode('Person', Bin).\n{ok,{'Person',\"Vince Eclipse\",roving,50}}\n5> 'People':decode('Person', {json_decoded,json:decode(Bin)}).\n{ok,{'Person',\"Vince Eclipse\",roving,50}}\n\n```","ref":"asn1_getting_started.html#special-decode-functionality-for-json-encoding-rules-jer"},{"type":"extras","title":"Errors - Getting Started","doc":"Errors detected at compile-time are displayed on the screen together with line\nnumbers indicating where in the source file the respective error was detected.\nIf no errors are found, an Erlang ASN.1 module is created.\n\nThe runtime encoders and decoders execute within a `catch` and return `{ok, Data}`\nor `{error, {asn1, Description}}` where `Description` is an Erlang term\ndescribing the error.\n\nCurrently, `Description` looks like this: `{ErrorDescription, StackTrace}`.\nApplications should not depend on the exact contents of `Description` as it\ncould change in the future.","ref":"asn1_getting_started.html#errors"},{"type":"extras","title":"Multi-File Compilation - Getting Started","doc":"There are various reasons for using multi-file compilation:\n\n- To choose the name for the generated module, for example, because you need to\n  compile the same specs for different encoding rules.\n- You want only one resulting module.\n\nSpecify which ASN.1 specs to compile in a module with extension `.set.asn`.\nChoose a module name and provide the names of the ASN.1 specs.

For example, it is possible to have the following:\n\n```text\nEmb ::= SEQUENCE {\n    a SEQUENCE OF OCTET STRING,\n    b SET {\n       a INTEGER,\n       b INTEGER DEFAULT 66},\n    c CHOICE {\n       a INTEGER,\n       b FooType } }\n\nFooType ::= [3] VisibleString\n```\n\nThe following records are generated because of type `Emb`:\n\n```erlang\n-record('Emb,{a, b, c}).\n-record('Emb_b',{a, b = asn1_DEFAULT}). % the embedded SET type\n```\n\nValues of type `Emb` can be assigned as follows:\n\n```erlang\nV = #'Emb'{a=[\"qqqq\",[1,2,255]],\n           b = #'Emb_b'{a=99},\n           c ={b,\"Can you see this\"}}.\n```\n\nFor an embedded type of type `SEQUENCE`/`SET` in a `SEQUENCE`/`SET`, the record\nname is extended with an underscore and the component name. If the embedded\nstructure is deeper with the `SEQUENCE`, `SET`, or `CHOICE` types in the line,\neach component name/alternative name is added to the record name.\n\nExample:\n\n```text\nSeq ::= SEQUENCE{\n    a CHOICE{\n        b SEQUENCE {\n           c  INTEGER\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis results in the following record:\n\n```erlang\n-record('Seq_a_b',{c}).\n```\n\nIf the structured type has a component with an embedded `SEQUENCE OF`/`SET OF`\nwhich embedded type in turn is a `SEQUENCE`/`SET`, it gives a record with the\n`SEQUENCE OF`/`SET OF` addition as in the following example:\n\n```text\nSeq ::= SEQUENCE {\n    a SEQUENCE OF SEQUENCE {\n           b\n               }\n    c SET OF SEQUENCE {\n           d\n               }\n}\n```\n\nThis results in the following records:\n\n```erlang\n-record('Seq_a_SEQOF'{b}).\n-record('Seq_c_SETOF'{d}).\n```\n\nA parameterized type is to be considered as an embedded type. Each time such a\ntype is referenced, an instance of it is defined. Thus, in the following example\na record with name `'Seq_b'` is generated in the `.hrl` file and is used to hold\nvalues:\n\n```text\nSeq ::= SEQUENCE {\n    b PType{INTEGER}\n}\n\nPType{T} ::= SEQUENCE{\n    id T\n}\n```","ref":"asn1_getting_started.html#embedded-structured-types"},{"type":"extras","title":"Recursive Types - Getting Started","doc":"Types that refer to themselves are called recursive types.

A value for this type is assigned in Erlang as follows:\n\n```erlang\nV = {something,#'Rec_something'{a = 77,\n                                b = \"some octets here\",\n                                c = {nothing,'NULL'}}}.\n```","ref":"asn1_getting_started.html#recursive-types"},{"type":"extras","title":"ASN.1 Values - Getting Started","doc":"Values can be assigned to an ASN.1 type within the ASN.1 code itself, as opposed\nto the actions in the previous section where a value was assigned to an ASN.1\ntype in Erlang. The full value syntax of ASN.1 is supported and X.680 describes\nin detail how to assign values in ASN.1. A short example:\n\n```erlang\nTT ::= SEQUENCE {\n   a INTEGER,\n   b SET OF OCTET STRING }\n\ntt TT ::= {a 77,b {\"kalle\",\"kula\"}}\n```\n\nThe value defined here can be used in several ways. It can, for example, be used\nas the value in some `DEFAULT` component:\n\n```text\nSS ::= SET {\n    s OBJECT IDENTIFIER,\n    val TT DEFAULT tt }\n```\n\nIt can also be used from inside an Erlang program. If this ASN.1 code is defined\nin ASN.1 module `Values`, the ASN.1 value `tt` can be reached from Erlang as a\nfunction call to `'Values':tt()` as in the following example:\n\n```erlang\n1> Val = 'Values':tt().\n{'TT',77,[\"kalle\",\"kula\"]}\n2> {ok,Bytes} = 'Values':encode('TT',Val).\n{ok,<<48,18,128,1,77,161,13,4,5,107,97,108,108,101,4,4,\n      107,117,108,97>>}\n4> 'Values':decode('TT',Bytes).\n{ok,{'TT',77,[\"kalle\",\"kula\"]}}\n5>\n```\n\nThis example shows that a function is generated by the compiler that returns a\nvalid Erlang representation of the value, although the value is of a complex\ntype.\n\nFurthermore, if the option `maps` is not used, a macro is generated for each\nvalue in the `.hrl` file.

Only a brief explanation is given\nhere.\n\nThese constructs makes it possible to define open types, that is, values of that\ntype can be of any ASN.1 type. Also, relationships can be defined between\ndifferent types and values, as classes can hold types, values, objects, object\nsets, and other classes in their fields. A class can be defined in ASN.1 as\nfollows:\n\n```text\nGENERAL-PROCEDURE ::= CLASS {\n      &Message,\n      &Reply               OPTIONAL,\n      &Error               OPTIONAL,\n      &id          PrintableString UNIQUE\n}\nWITH SYNTAX {\n      NEW MESSAGE     &Message\n      [REPLY           &Reply]\n      [ERROR           &Error]\n      ADDRESS          &id\n}\n```\n\nAn object is an instance of a class. An object set is a set containing objects\nof a specified class. A definition can look as follows:\n\n```text\nobject1 GENERAL-PROCEDURE ::= {\n    NEW MESSAGE      PrintableString\n    ADDRESS          \"home\"\n}\n\nobject2 GENERAL-PROCEDURE ::= {\n    NEW MESSAGE INTEGER\n    ERROR INTEGER\n    ADDRESS \"remote\"\n}\n```\n\nThe object `object1` is an instance of the class `GENERAL-PROCEDURE` and has one\ntype field and one fixed type value field. The object `object2` has also an\noptional field `ERROR`, which is a type field. The field `ADDRESS` is a `UNIQUE`\nfield. Objects in an object set must have unique values in their `UNIQUE` field,\nas in `GENERAL-PROCEDURES`:\n\n```text\nGENERAL-PROCEDURES GENERAL-PROCEDURE ::= {\n    object1 | object2}\n```\n\nYou cannot encode a class, object, or object set, only refer to it when defining\nother ASN.1 entities. Typically you refer to a class as well as to object sets\nby table constraints and component relation constraints (X.682) in ASN.1 types,\nas in the following:\n\n```erlang\nStartMessage  ::= SEQUENCE {\n    msgId  GENERAL-PROCEDURE.&id  ({GENERAL-PROCEDURES}),\n    content GENERAL-PROCEDURE.&Message ({GENERAL-PROCEDURES}{@msgId}),\n    }\n```\n\nIn type `StartMessage`, the constraint following field `content` tells that in a\nvalue of type `StartMessage` the value in field `content` must come from the\nsame object that is chosen by field `msgId`.\n\nSo, the value `#'StartMessage'{msgId=\"home\",content=\"Any Printable String\"}` is\nlegal to encode as a `StartMessage` value. However, the value\n`#'StartMessage'{msgId=\"remote\", content=\"Some String\"}` is illegal as the\nconstraint in `StartMessage` tells that when you have chosen a value from a\nspecific object in object set `GENERAL-PROCEDURES` in field `msgId`, you must\nchoose a value from that same object in the content field too. In this second\ncase, it is to be any `INTEGER` value.\n\n`StartMessage` can in field `content` be encoded with a value of any type that\nan object in object set `GENERAL-PROCEDURES` has in its `NEW MESSAGE` field.\nThis field refers to a type field `&Message` in the class. Field `msgId` is\nalways encoded as a `PrintableString`, as the field refers to a fixed type in\nthe class.\n\nIn practice, object sets are usually declared to be extensible so that more\nobjects can be added to the set later. Extensibility is indicated as follows:\n\n```text\nGENERAL-PROCEDURES GENERAL-PROCEDURE ::= {\n    object1 | object2, ...}\n```\n\nWhen decoding a type that uses an extensible set constraint, it is always\npossible that the value in field `UNIQUE` is unknown (that is, the type has been\nencoded with a later version of the ASN.1 specification). The unencoded data is\nthen returned wrapped in a tuple as follows:\n\n```text\n{asn1_OPENTYPE,Binary}\n```\n\nHere `Binary` is an Erlang binary that contains the encoded data. (If option\n`legacy_erlang_types` has been given, only the binary is returned.)","ref":"asn1_getting_started.html#asn-1-information-objects-x-681"},{"type":"extras","title":"Parameterization (X.683) - Getting Started","doc":"Parameterization, which is defined in X.683, can be used when defining types,\nvalues, value sets, classes, objects, or object sets. A part of a definition can\nbe supplied as a parameter. For example, if a `Type` is used in a definition\nwith a certain purpose, you want the type name to express the intention. This\ncan be done with parameterization.\n\nWhen many types (or another ASN.1 entity) only differ in some minor cases, but\nthe structure of the types is similar, only one general type can be defined and\nthe differences can be supplied through parameters.\n\nExample of use of parameterization:\n\n```text\nGeneral{Type} ::= SEQUENCE\n{\n     number     INTEGER,\n     string     Type\n}\n\nT1 ::= General{PrintableString}\n\nT2 ::= General{BIT STRING}\n```\n\nAn example of a value that can be encoded as type `T1` is `{12,\"hello\"}`.\n\nNotice that the compiler does not generate encode/decode functions for\nparameterized types, only for the instances of the parameterized types.\nTherefore, if a file contains the types `General{}`, `T1`, and `T2` as in the\nprevious example, encode/decode functions are only generated for `T1` and `T2`.","ref":"asn1_getting_started.html#parameterization-x-683"},{"type":"extras","title":"Specialized Decodes","doc":"<!--\n%CopyrightBegin%\n\nCopyright Ericsson AB 2023-2024.
