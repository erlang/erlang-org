This is done by sending\nand receiving information to/from the process through a third process, called\nthe meta process. You can implement your own attached process. See `int.erl` for\navailable functions and `dbg_wx_trace.erl` for possible messages.\n\nThe interpreter depends on the Kernel, STDLIB, and WX applications. This means\nthat modules belonging to any of these applications are not allowed to be\ninterpreted, as it could lead to a deadlock or emulator crash.

An inactive breakpoint is ignored.\n- A trigger action.
