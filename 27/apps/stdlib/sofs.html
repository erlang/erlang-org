<p>Functions for manipulating sets of sets.</p><p>This module provides operations on finite sets and relations represented as
sets. Intuitively, a set is a collection of elements; every element belongs to
the set, and the set contains every element.</p><p>The data representing <code class="inline">sofs</code> as used by this module is to be regarded as opaque
by other modules. In abstract terms, the representation is a composite type of
existing Erlang terms. See note on
<a href="../../system/data_types.html#no_user_types">data types</a>. Any code assuming
knowledge of the format is running on thin ice.</p><p>Given a set A and a sentence S(x), where x is a free variable, a new set B whose
elements are exactly those elements of A for which S(x) holds can be formed,
this is denoted B = {x in A : S(x)}. Sentences are expressed using the logical
operators &quot;for some&quot; (or &quot;there exists&quot;), &quot;for all&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, &quot;not&quot;. If the
existence of a set containing all the specified elements is known (as is always
the case in this module), this is denoted B = {x : S(x)}.</p><ul><li><p>The <em>unordered set</em> containing the elements a, b, and c is denoted
{a, b, c}. This notation is not to be confused with tuples.</p><p>The <em>ordered pair</em> of a and b, with first <em>coordinate</em> a and second coordinate
b, is denoted (a, b). An ordered pair is an <em>ordered set</em> of two elements. In
this module, ordered sets can contain one, two, or more elements, and
parentheses are used to enclose the elements.</p><p>Unordered sets and ordered sets are orthogonal, again in this module; there is
no unordered set equal to any ordered set.</p></li><li><p>The <em>empty set</em> contains no elements.</p><p>Set A is <em id="equal">equal</em> to set B if they contain the same elements, which
is denoted A = B. Two ordered sets are equal if they contain the same number
of elements and have equal elements at each coordinate.</p><p>Set B is a <em id="subset">subset</em> of set A if A contains all elements that B
contains.</p><p>The <em id="union">union</em> of two sets A and B is the smallest set that contains
all elements of A and all elements of B.</p><p>The <em id="intersection">intersection</em> of two sets A and B is the set that
contains all elements of A that belong to B.</p><p>Two sets are <em id="disjoint">disjoint</em> if their intersection is the empty set.</p><p>The <em id="difference">difference</em> of two sets A and B is the set that contains
all elements of A that do not belong to B.</p><p>The <em id="symmetric_difference">symmetric difference</em> of two sets is the set
that contains those element that belong to either of the two sets, but not
both.</p><p>The <em id="union_n">union</em> of a collection of sets is the smallest set that
contains all the elements that belong to at least one set of the collection.</p><p>The <em id="intersection_n">intersection</em> of a non-empty collection of sets is
the set that contains all elements that belong to every set of the collection.</p></li><li><p>The <em id="Cartesian_product">Cartesian product</em> of two sets X and Y, denoted
X × Y, is the set {a : a = (x, y) for some x in X and for some y in Y}.</p><p>A <em id="relation">relation</em> is a subset of X × Y. Let R be a relation. The fact
that (x, y) belongs to R is written as x R y. As relations are sets, the
definitions of the last item (subset, union, and so on) apply to relations as
well.</p><p>The <em id="domain">domain</em> of R is the set {x : x R y for some y in Y}.</p><p>The <em id="range">range</em> of R is the set {y : x R y for some x in X}.</p><p>The <em id="converse">converse</em> of R is the set {a : a = (y, x) for some
(x, y) in R}.</p><p>If A is a subset of X, the <em id="image">image</em> of A under R is the set {y :
x R y for some x in A}. If B is a subset of Y, the <em id="inverse_image">inverse image</em> of B is the set {x : x R y for some y in B}.</p><p>If R is a relation from X to Y, and S is a relation from Y to Z, the <em id="relative_product">relative
product</em> of R and S is the relation T from X to Z
defined so that x T z if and only if there exists an element y in Y such that
x R y and y S z.</p><p>The <em id="restriction">restriction</em> of R to A is the set S defined so that
x S y if and only if there exists an element x in A such that x R y.</p><p>If S is a restriction of R to A, then R is an <em id="extension">extension</em> of S
to X.</p><p>If X = Y, then R is called a relation <em>in</em> X.</p><p>The <em id="field">field</em> of a relation R in X is the union of the domain of R
and the range of R.</p><p>If R is a relation in X, and if S is defined so that x S y if x R y and not
x = y, then S is the <em id="strict_relation">strict</em> relation corresponding to
R. Conversely, if S is a relation in X, and if R is defined so that x R y if
x S y or x = y, then R is the <em id="weak_relation">weak</em> relation corresponding
to S.</p><p>A relation R in X is <em>reflexive</em> if x R x for every element x of X, it is
<em>symmetric</em> if x R y implies that y R x, and it is <em>transitive</em> if x R y and
y R z imply that x R z.</p></li><li><p>A <em id="function">function</em> F is a relation, a subset of X × Y, such that the
domain of F is equal to X and such that for every x in X there is a unique
element y in Y with (x, y) in F. The latter condition can be formulated as
follows: if x F y and x F z, then y = z. In this module, it is not required
that the domain of F is equal to X for a relation to be considered a function.</p><p>Instead of writing (x, y) in F or x F y, we write F(x) = y when F is a
function, and say that F maps x onto y, or that the value of F at x is y.</p><p>As functions are relations, the definitions of the last item (domain, range,
and so on) apply to functions as well.</p><p>If the converse of a function F is a function F', then F' is called the
<em id="inverse">inverse</em> of F.</p><p>The relative product of two functions F1 and F2 is called the <em id="composite">composite</em> of F1 and F2 if the range of F1 is a subset of the domain of F2.</p></li><li><p>Sometimes, when the range of a function is more important than the function
itself, the function is called a <em>family</em>.</p><p>The domain of a family is called the <em>index set</em>, and the range is called the
<em>indexed set</em>.</p><p>If x is a family from I to X, then x[i] denotes the value of the function at
index i. The notation &quot;a family in X&quot; is used for such a family.</p><p>When the indexed set is a set of subsets of a set X, we call x a <em id="family">family of
subsets</em> of X.</p><p>If x is a family of subsets of X, the union of the range of x is called the
<em>union of the family</em> x.</p><p>If x is non-empty (the index set is non-empty), the <em>intersection of the
family</em> x is the intersection of the range of x.</p><p>In this module, the only families that are considered are families of subsets
of some set X; in the following, the word &quot;family&quot; is used for such families
of subsets.</p></li><li><p>A <em id="partition">partition</em> of a set X is a collection S of non-empty subsets
of X whose union is X and whose elements are pairwise disjoint.</p><p>A relation in a set is an <em>equivalence relation</em> if it is reflexive,
symmetric, and transitive.</p><p>If R is an equivalence relation in X, and x is an element of X, the
<em id="equivalence_class">equivalence class</em> of x with respect to R is the set
of all those elements y of X for which x R y holds. The equivalence classes
constitute a partitioning of X. Conversely, if C is a partition of X, the
relation that holds for any two elements of X if they belong to the same
equivalence class, is an equivalence relation induced by the partition C.</p><p>If R is an equivalence relation in X, the <em id="canonical_map">canonical map</em>
is the function that maps every element of X onto its equivalence class.</p></li><li><p><a href="" id="binary_relation"></a> Relations as defined above (as sets of ordered
pairs) are from now on referred to as <em>binary relations</em>.</p><p>We call a set of ordered sets (x[1], ..., x[n]) an <em id="n_ary_relation">(n-ary) relation</em>, and say that the relation is a subset of the <a href="" id="Cartesian_product_tuple"></a> Cartesian product X[1] × ... × X[n], where x[i]
is an element of X[i], 1 &lt;= i &lt;= n.</p><p>The <em id="projection">projection</em> of an n-ary relation R onto coordinate i is
the set {x[i] : (x[1], ..., x[i], ..., x[n]) in R for some
x[j] in X[j], 1 &lt;= j &lt;= n and not i = j}. The projections of a binary
relation R onto the first and second coordinates are the domain and the range
of R, respectively.</p><p>The relative product of binary relations can be generalized to n-ary relations
as follows. Let TR be an ordered set (R[1], ..., R[n]) of binary relations
from X to Y[i] and S a binary relation from (Y[1] × ... × Y[n]) to Z. The
<em id="tuple_relative_product">relative product</em> of TR and S is the binary
relation T from X to Z defined so that x T z if and only if there exists an
element y[i] in Y[i] for each 1 &lt;= i &lt;= n such that x R[i] y[i] and
(y[1], ..., y[n]) S z. Now let TR be a an ordered set (R[1], ..., R[n]) of
binary relations from X[i] to Y[i] and S a subset of X[1] × ... × X[n].
The <em id="multiple_relative_product">multiple relative product</em> of TR and S is
defined to be the set {z : z = ((x[1], ..., x[n]), (y[1],...,y[n])) for
some (x[1], ..., x[n]) in S and for some (x[i], y[i]) in R[i],
1 &lt;= i &lt;= n}.</p><p>The <em id="natural_join">natural join</em> of an n-ary relation R and an m-ary
relation S on coordinate i and j is defined to be the set {z : z =
(x[1], ..., x[n],  y[1], ..., y[j-1], y[j+1], ..., y[m]) for some
(x[1], ..., x[n]) in R and for some (y[1], ..., y[m]) in S such that
x[i] = y[j]}.</p></li><li><p><a href="" id="sets_definition"></a> The sets recognized by this module are represented
by elements of the relation Sets, which is defined as the smallest set such
that:</p><ul><li>For every atom T, except '_', and for every term X, (T, X) belongs to Sets
(<em>atomic sets</em>).</li><li>(['_'], []) belongs to Sets (the <em>untyped empty set</em>).</li><li>For every tuple T = {T[1], ..., T[n]} and for every tuple X =
{X[1], ..., X[n]}, if (T[i], X[i]) belongs to Sets for every
1 &lt;= i &lt;= n, then (T, X) belongs to Sets (<em>ordered sets</em>).</li><li>For every term T, if X is the empty list or a non-empty sorted list
[X[1], ..., X[n]] without duplicates such that (T, X[i]) belongs to Sets
for every 1 &lt;= i &lt;= n, then ([T], X) belongs to Sets (<em>typed unordered
sets</em>).</li></ul><p>An <em id="external_set">external set</em> is an element of the range of Sets.</p><p>A <em id="type">type</em> is an element of the domain of Sets.</p><p>If S is an element (T, X) of Sets, then T is a <em id="valid_type">valid type</em> of
X, T is the type of S, and X is the external set of S. <a href="#from_term/2"><code class="inline">from_term/2</code></a> creates a
set from a type and an Erlang term turned into an external set.</p><p>The sets represented by Sets are the elements of the range of function Set
from Sets to Erlang terms and sets of Erlang terms:</p><ul><li>Set(T,Term) = Term, where T is an atom</li><li>Set({T[1], ..., T[n]}, {X[1], ...,  X[n]}) =
(Set(T[1], X[1]), ...,  Set(T[n], X[n]))</li><li>Set([T], [X[1], ..., X[n]]) = {Set(T, X[1]), ..., Set(T, X[n])}</li><li>Set([T], []) = {}</li></ul><p>When there is no risk of confusion, elements of Sets are identified with the
sets they represent. For example, if U is the result of calling <a href="#union/2"><code class="inline">union/2</code></a> with
S1 and S2 as arguments, then U is said to be the union of S1 and S2. A more
precise formulation is that Set(U) is the union of Set(S1) and Set(S2).</p></li></ul><p>The types are used to implement the various conditions that sets must fulfill.
As an example, consider the relative product of two sets R and S, and recall
that the relative product of R and S is defined if R is a binary relation to Y
and S is a binary relation from Y. The function that implements the relative
product, <a href="#relative_product/2"><code class="inline">relative_product/2</code></a>, checks that the arguments represent binary
relations by matching [{A,B}] against the type of the first argument (Arg1
say), and [{C,D}] against the type of the second argument (Arg2 say). The
fact that [{A,B}] matches the type of Arg1 is to be interpreted as Arg1
representing a binary relation from X to Y, where X is defined as all sets
Set(x) for some element x in Sets the type of which is A, and similarly for Y.
In the same way Arg2 is interpreted as representing a binary relation from W to
Z. Finally it is checked that B matches C, which is sufficient to ensure that W
is equal to Y. The untyped empty set is handled separately: its type, ['_'],
matches the type of any unordered set.</p><p>A few functions of this module (<a href="#drestriction/3"><code class="inline">drestriction/3</code></a>, <a href="#family_projection/2"><code class="inline">family_projection/2</code></a>,
<a href="#partition/2"><code class="inline">partition/2</code></a>, <a href="#partition_family/2"><code class="inline">partition_family/2</code></a>, <a href="#projection/2"><code class="inline">projection/2</code></a>, <a href="#restriction/3"><code class="inline">restriction/3</code></a>,
<a href="#substitution/2"><code class="inline">substitution/2</code></a>) accept an Erlang function as a means to modify each element of
a given unordered set. <a href="" id="set_fun"></a> Such a function, called SetFun in the
following, can be specified as a functional object (fun), a tuple
<code class="inline">{external, Fun}</code>, or an integer:</p><ul><li>If SetFun is specified as a fun, the fun is applied to each element of the
given set and the return value is assumed to be a set.</li><li>If SetFun is specified as a tuple <code class="inline">{external, Fun}</code>, Fun is applied to the
external set of each element of the given set and the return value is assumed
to be an external set. Selecting the elements of an unordered set as external
sets and assembling a new unordered set from a list of external sets is in the
present implementation more efficient than modifying each element as a set.
However, this optimization can only be used when the elements of the unordered
set are atomic or ordered sets. It must also be the case that the type of the
elements matches some clause of Fun (the type of the created set is the result
of applying Fun to the type of the given set), and that Fun does nothing but
selecting, duplicating, or rearranging parts of the elements.</li><li>Specifying a SetFun as an integer I is equivalent to specifying
<code class="inline">{external, fun(X) -&gt; element(I, X) end}</code>, but is to be preferred, as it makes
it possible to handle this case even more efficiently.</li></ul><p>Examples of SetFuns:</p><pre><code class="makeup erlang" translate="no"><span class="k">fun</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">sofs</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">union</span><span class="p">/</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="w">

from a collection of ordered sets can be the way to go if the ordered sets are
big and one does not want to waste heap by rebuilding the elements of the
unordered set. The following example shows that a set can be built &quot;layer by
