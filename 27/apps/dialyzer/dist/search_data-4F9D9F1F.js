The file and line number of a discrepancy is\nreported along with an indication of the nature of the discrepancy.\nDialyzer bases its analysis on the concept of success typings,\nensuring sound warnings without false positives.\n\n[](){: #command_line }","title":"dialyzer","ref":"dialyzer.html"},{"type":"module","doc":"This section provides a brief description of the options available\nwhen running Dialyzer from the command line. The same information can\nbe obtained by writing the following in a shell:\n\n```text\ndialyzer --help\n```\n\n_Exit status of the command-line version:_\n\n- **`0`** - No problems were found during the analysis and no warnings were\n  emitted.\n\n- **`1`** - Problems were found during the analysis.\n\n- **`2`** - No problems were found during the analysis, but warnings were\n  emitted.\n\n_Usage:_\n\n```text\ndialyzer [--add_to_plt] [--apps applications] [--build_plt]\n         [--check_plt] [-Ddefine]* [-Dname]* [--dump_callgraph file]\n         [--error_location flag] [files_or_dirs] [--fullpath]\n         [--get_warnings] [--help] [-I include_dir]*\n         [--incremental] [--metrics_file] [--no_check_plt] [--no_indentation]\n         [--no_spec] [-o outfile] [--output_plt file] [-pa dir]* [--plt plt]\n         [--plt_info] [--plts plt*] [--quiet] [-r dirs] [--raw]\n         [--remove_from_plt] [--shell] [--src] [--statistics] [--verbose]\n         [--version] [--warning_apps applications] [-Wwarn]*\n```\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> \\* denotes that multiple occurrences of the option are possible.\n\n_Options of the command-line version:_\n\n- **`--add_to_plt`** - The PLT is extended to also include the files specified\n  with `-c` and `-r`. Use `--plt` to specify which PLT to start from, and\n  `--output_plt` to specify where to put the PLT. Note that files already\n  included in the PLT will be reanalyzed if they depend on the new files.\n  This option only works for BEAM files, not source files.\n\n- **`--apps applications`** - By default, warnings will be reported to all\n  applications given by `--apps`. However, if `--warning_apps` is used, only\n  those applications given to `--warning_apps` will have warnings reported. All\n  applications given by `--apps`, but not `--warning_apps`, will be analysed to\n  provide context to the analysis, but warnings will not be reported for them.\n  For example, you may want to include libraries you depend on in the analysis\n  with `--apps` so discrepancies in their usage can be found, but only include\n  your own code with `--warning_apps` so that discrepancies are only reported in\n  code that you own.\n\n- **`--warning_apps applications`** - This option is typically used when\n  building or modifying a PLT as in:\n\n  ```text\n  dialyzer --build_plt --apps erts kernel stdlib mnesia ...\n  ```\n\n  to refer conveniently to library applications corresponding to the\n  Erlang/OTP installation. This option can also be used during\n  analysis to refer to Erlang/OTP applications. File or directory\n  names can also be included, as in:\n\n  ```text\n  dialyzer --apps inets ssl ./ebin ../other_lib/ebin/my_module.beam\n  ```\n\n- **`--build_plt`** - The analysis starts from an empty PLT and creates a new\n  one from the files specified with `-c` and `-r`. This option only works for\n  BEAM files. To override the default PLT location, use `--plt` or\n  `--output_plt`.\n\n- **`--check_plt`** - Check the PLT for consistency and rebuild it if it is not\n  up-to-date.\n\n- **`-Dname` (or `-Dname=value`)** - When analyzing from source, pass the define\n  to Dialyzer. (\\*\\*)\n\n- **`--dump_callgraph file`** - Dump the call graph into the specified file\n  whose format is determined by the filename extension. Supported extensions\n  are: `raw`, `dot`, and `ps`. If something else is used as filename extension,\n  the default `.raw` format is used.\n\n- **`--error_location column | line`{: #error_location }** - Use a pair\n  `{Line, Column}` or an integer `Line` to pinpoint the location of warnings.\n  The default is to use a pair `{Line, Column}`. When formatted, the line and\n  the column are separated by a colon.\n\n- **`files_or_dirs` (for backward compatibility also as `-c files_or_dirs`)** -\n  Use Dialyzer from the command line to detect defects in the specified files or\n  directories containing `.erl` or `.beam` files, depending on the type of the\n  analysis.\n\n- **`--fullpath`** - Display the full path names of files for which warnings are\n  emitted.\n\n- **`--get_warnings`** - Make Dialyzer emit warnings even when manipulating the\n  PLT. Warnings are only emitted for files that are analyzed.\n\n- **`--help` (or `-h`)** - Print a help message and exit.\n\n- **`-I include_dir`** - When analyzing from source, pass the `include_dir` to\n  Dialyzer. (\\*\\*)\n\n- **`--input_list_file file`** - Analyze the file names that are listed in the\n  specified file (one file name per line).\n\n- **`--no_check_plt`** - Skip the PLT check when running Dialyzer. This is\n  useful when working with installed PLTs that never change.\n\n- **`--incremental`** - The analysis starts from an existing incremental PLT, or\n  builds one from scratch if one does not exist, and runs the minimal amount of\n  additional analysis to report all issues in the given set of apps. Notably,\n  incremental PLT files are not compatible with \"classic\" PLT files, and vice\n  versa. The initial incremental PLT will be updated unless an alternative\n  output incremental PLT is given.\n\n- **`--no_indentation`** - Do not insert line breaks in types, contracts, and\n  Erlang Code when formatting warnings.\n\n- **`--no_spec`** - Ignore functions specs. This is useful for debugging when\n  one suspects that some specs are incorrect.\n\n- **`-o outfile` (or `--output outfile`)** - When using Dialyzer from the\n  command line, send the analysis results to the specified outfile rather than\n  to `stdout`.\n\n- **`--metrics_file file`** - Write metrics about Dialyzer's incrementality (for\n  example, total number of modules considered, how many modules were changed\n  since the PLT was last updated, how many modules needed to be analyzed) to a\n  file. This can be useful for tracking and debugging Dialyzer's incrementality.\n\n- **`--output_plt file`** - Store the PLT at the specified file after building\n  it.\n\n- **`-pa dir`** - Include `dir` in the path for Erlang. This is useful when\n  analyzing files that have `-include_lib()` directives.\n\n- **`--plt plt`** - Use the specified PLT as the initial PLT. If the PLT was\n  built during setup, the files are checked for consistency.\n\n- **`--plt_info`** - Make Dialyzer print information about the PLT and then\n  quit. The PLT can be specified with `--plt(s)`.\n\n- **`--plts plt*`** - Merge the specified PLTs to create the initial PLT. This\n  requires that the PLTs are disjoint (that is, do not have any module appearing\n  in more than one PLT). The PLTs are created in the usual way:\n\n  ```text\n  dialyzer --build_plt --output_plt plt_1 files_to_include\n  ...\n  dialyzer --build_plt --output_plt plt_n files_to_include\n  ```\n\n  They can then be used in either of the following ways:\n\n  ```text\n  dialyzer files_to_analyze --plts plt_1 ... plt_n\n  ```\n\n  or\n\n  ```text\n  dialyzer --plts plt_1 ... plt_n -- files_to_analyze\n  ```\n\n  Notice the `--` delimiter in the second case.\n\n- **`--quiet` (or `-q`)** - Make Dialyzer a bit more quiet.\n\n- **`-r dirs`** - Same as `files_or_dirs`, but the specified directories are\n  searched recursively for subdirectories containing `.erl` or `.beam` files in\n  them, depending on the type of analysis.\n\n- **`--raw`** - When using Dialyzer from the command line, output the raw\n  analysis results (Erlang terms) instead of the formatted result. The raw\n  format is easier to post-process (for example, to filter warnings or to output\n  HTML pages).\n\n- **`--remove_from_plt`** - The information from the files specified with `-c`\n  and `-r` is removed from the PLT. Notice that this can cause a reanalysis of\n  the remaining dependent files.\n\n- **`--src`** - Override the default, which is to analyze BEAM files, and\n  analyze starting from Erlang source code instead.\n\n- **`--statistics`** - Print information about the progress of execution\n  (analysis phases, time spent in each, and size of the relative input).\n\n- **`--verbose`** - Make Dialyzer a bit more verbose.\n\n- **`--version` (or `-v`)** - Print the Dialyzer version and some more\n  information and exit.\n\n- **`-Wwarn`** - A family of options that selectively turn on/off warnings. (For\n  help on the names of warnings, use `dialyzer -Whelp`.) Notice that the options\n  can also be specified in the file with a `-dialyzer()` attribute.

The\n  default is to warn about unknown functions and types when setting the exit\n  status. When using Dialyzer from Erlang, warnings about unknown functions and\n  types are returned.\n\n- **`-Wunderspecs` (\\*\\*\\*)** - Warn about underspecified functions (the\n  specification is strictly more allowing than the success typing).\n\n- **`-Wunmatched_returns` (\\*\\*\\*)** - Include warnings for function calls that\n  ignore a structured return value or do not match against one of many possible\n  return values. However, no warnings are included if the possible return values\n  are a union of atoms or a union of numbers.\n\nThe following options are also available, but their use is not recommended (they\nare mostly for Dialyzer developers and internal debugging):\n\n- **`-Woverspecs` (\\*\\*\\*)** - Warn about overspecified functions (the\n  specification is strictly less allowing than the success typing).\n\n- **`-Wspecdiffs` (\\*\\*\\*)** - Warn when the specification is different than the\n  success typing.\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> \\*\\*\\* denotes options that turn on warnings rather than turning them off.\n\nThe following options are not strictly needed as they specify the\ndefault.

This new incremental mode is\n  likely to become the default in a future release.\n\n  Incremental mode primarily differs from the previous, \"classic\", ways of\n  running Dialyzer, in that its model is optimised around the common use case of\n  regularly analysing a single codebase, tweaking the code, analysing it again,\n  and so on, without explicit reference to the building and checking of a PLT.\n\n  In this mode the PLT file acts much more like a true cache, where users\n  provide a codebase and a set of files they care about, and Dialyzer does the\n  legwork in terms of deciding how to most efficiently report all of the\n  relevant warnings given the cached results it may already have in the PLT (and\n  if a PLT doesn't exist, incremental mode will create one).\n\n  Own Id: OTP-18188 Aux Id: PR-5997\n\n- Dialyzer now produces clearer error messages for contract violations.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-18238 Aux Id: PR-6271\n\n- The name of a built-in type can now be reused as the name of type locally.\n  That is useful when an OTP release introduces a new built-in type; having the\n  possibility to redefine built-in types locally can make it easier to maintain\n  code that works in multiple OTP releases.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-18282 Aux Id: GH-6132, PR-6335\n\n- There is new option `-no_spec` to ignore all specs.

This means that we lose the dependency from each\n  corresponding input to output type. Because of this, the warning is really\n  about not being able to establish a dependency between the input and output\n  types of each respective overloaded function specification.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-18342 Aux Id: GH-6117, PR-6654\n\n- Dialyzer has enabled (by default) warnings about unknown types and functions.\n\n  Prior to this change, Dialyzer had warnings about unknown types and functions\n  disabled (by default).\n\n  This default value has been overwritten; Dialyzer now warns about unknown\n  types and functions (as requested by the community in GH-5695). Thus, the\n  following two examples are equivalent, i.e., passing the `-Wunknown` function\n  is enabled by default:\n\n  `dialyzer moduler.erl -Wunknown -Wmissing_return`\n\n  `dialyzer moduler.erl -Wmissing_return`\n\n  Dialyzer has a new flag, `-Wno_unknown`.

This catches many common\n  programming errors (e.g. calling `file:close/1` and not checking for the\n  absence of errors), interface discrepancies (e.g. a function returning\n  multiple values when in reality the function is void and only called for its\n  side-effects), calling the wrong function (e.g. `io_lib:format/1` instead of\n  `io:format/1`), and even possible performance defects (e.g. unnecessarily\n  constructing a list using a list comprehension instead of using\n  `lists:foreach/2`). Whenever a function returns a single atomic value (e.g.\n  'ok' or pid()), the warning is suppressed. This allows for \"void\" functions\n  (returning a single atom like 'ok') or for calls to certain builtins like\n  `spawn`. Because not all calls which ignore the return value are\n  discrepancies, the option is off by default and has to be explicitly requested\n  by the user.

It is\nrecommended to build a PLT with the Erlang/OTP applications that you are using,\nbut also to include your own applications that you are using frequently.\n\nThe PLT is built using option `--build_plt` to Dialyzer. The following command\nbuilds the recommended minimal PLT for Erlang/OTP:\n\n```text\ndialyzer --build_plt --apps erts kernel stdlib mnesia\n```\n\nDialyzer looks if there is an environment variable called `DIALYZER_PLT` and\nplaces the PLT at this location. If no such variable is set, Dialyzer places the\nPLT in a file called .dialyzer_plt in the\n[`filename:basedir(user_cache, \"erlang\")`](`m:filename#user_cache`) folder. The\nplacement can also be specified using the options `--plt` or `--output_plt`.\n\nInformation can be added to an existing PLT using option `--add_to_plt`. If you\nalso want to include the Erlang compiler in the PLT and place it in a new PLT,\nthen use the following command:\n\n```text\ndialyzer --add_to_plt --apps compiler --output_plt my.plt\n```\n\nThen you can add your favorite application `my_app` to the new PLT:\n\n```text\ndialyzer --add_to_plt --plt my.plt -r my_app/ebin\n```\n\nBut you realize that it is unnecessary to have the Erlang compiler in this one:\n\n```text\ndialyzer --remove_from_plt --plt my.plt --apps compiler\n```\n\nLater, when you have fixed a bug in your application `my_app`, you want to update\nthe PLT so that it becomes fresh the next time you run Dialyzer. In this case,\nrun the following command:\n\n```text\ndialyzer --check_plt --plt my.plt\n```\n\nDialyzer then reanalyzes the changed files and the files that depend on these\nfiles. Note that this consistency check is performed automatically the next\ntime you run Dialyzer with this PLT. Use option `--check_plt` to perform the\nconsistency check without doing any other analysis.\n\nTo get information about a PLT, use the following option:\n\n```text\ndialyzer --plt_info\n```\n\nTo specify which PLT, use option `--plt`.\n\nTo get the output printed to a file, use option `--output_file`.\n\nNote that no warnings are emitted when manipulating the PLT.

This means Dialyzer can find genuine bugs in complex\ncode, and is pragmatic in the face of missing specs or limited information about\nthe codebase, only reporting issues which it can prove have the potential to\ncause a genuine issue at runtime. This means Dialyzer will sometimes not report\nevery bug, since it cannot always find this proof.","title":"Dialyzer's Model of Analysis - Dialyzer","ref":"dialyzer_chapter.html#dialyzer-s-model-of-analysis"},{"type":"extras","doc":"Dialyzer infers types for all top-level functions in a module. If the module\nalso has a spec given in the source-code, Dialyzer will compare the inferred\ntype to the spec. The comparison checks, for each argument and the return, that\nthe inferred and specified types overlap — which is to say, the types have at\nleast one possible runtime value in common. Notice that Dialyzer does not check\nthat one type contains a subset of values of the other, or that they are\nprecisely equal: This allows Dialyzer to make simplifying assumptions to\npreserve performance and avoid reporting program flows which could potentially\nsucceed at runtime.\n\nIf the inferred and specified types do not overlap, Dialyzer will warn that the\nspec is invalid with respect to the implementation. However, if they do overlap,\nDialyzer will proceed under the assumption that the correct type for the given\nfunction is the intersection of the inferred type and the specified type (the\nrationale being that the user may know something that Dialyzer itself cannot\ndeduce). One implication of this is that if the user gives a spec for a function\nwhich overlaps with Dialyzer's inferred type, but is more restrictive, Dialyzer\nwill trust those restrictions. This may then generate an error elsewhere that\nfollows from the erroneously restricted spec.\n\n_Examples:_\n\nNon-overlapping argument:\n\n```erlang\n-spec foo(boolean()) -> string().\n%% Dialyzer will infer: foo(integer()) -> string().\nfoo(N) ->\n    integer_to_list(N).\n```\n\nSince the type of the argument in the spec is different from the type that\nDialyzer inferred, Dialyzer will generate the following warning:\n\n```erlang\nsome_module.erl:7:2: Invalid type specification for function some_module:foo/1.\n The success typing is some_module:foo\n          (integer()) -> string()\n But the spec is some_module:foo\n          (boolean()) -> string()\n They do not overlap in the 1st argument\n```\n\nNon-overlapping return:\n\n```erlang\n-spec bar(a | b) -> atom().\n%% Dialyzer will infer: bar(a | b) -> binary().\nbar(a) -> <<\"a\">>;\nbar(b) -> <<\"b\">>.\n```\n\nSince the return value in the spec and the return value inferred by Dialyzer are\ndifferent, Dialyzer will generate the following warning:\n\n```erlang\nsome_module.erl:11:2: Invalid type specification for function some_module:bar/1.\n The success typing is some_module:bar\n          ('a' | 'b') -> <<_:8>>\n But the spec is some_module:bar\n          ('a' | 'b') -> atom()\n The return types do not overlap\n```\n\nOverlapping spec and inferred type:\n\n```erlang\n-spec baz(a | b) -> non_neg_integer().\n%% Dialyzer will infer: baz(b | c | d) -> -1 | 0 | 1.\nbaz(b) -> -1;\nbaz(c) -> 0;\nbaz(d) -> 1.\n```\n\nDialyzer will \"trust\" the spec and using the intersection of the spec and\ninferred type:\n\n```text\nbaz(b) -> 0 | 1.\n```\n\nNotice how the `c` and `d` from the argument to `baz/1` and the `-1` in the\nreturn from the inferred type were dropped once the spec and inferred type were\nintersected. This could result in warnings being emitted for later functions.\n\nFor example, if `baz/1` is called like this:\n\n```text\ncall_baz1(A) ->\n    case baz(A) of\n        -1 -> negative;\n        0 -> zero;\n        1 -> positive\n    end.\n```\n\nDialyzer will generate the following warning:\n\n```text\nsome_module.erl:25:9: The pattern\n          -1 can never match the type\n          0 | 1\n```\n\nIf `baz/1` is called like this:\n\n```text\ncall_baz2() ->\n    baz(a).\n```\n\nDialyzer will generate the following warnings:\n\n```text\nsome_module.erl:30:1: Function call_baz2/0 has no local return\nsome_module.erl:31:9: The call t:baz\n         ('a') will never return since it differs in the 1st argument\n               from the success typing arguments:\n         ('b' | 'c' | 'd')\n```","title":"How Dialyzer Uses Function Specifications - Dialyzer","ref":"dialyzer_chapter.html#how-dialyzer-uses-function-specifications"},{"type":"extras","doc":"We very much welcome user feedback!
