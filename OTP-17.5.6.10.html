        release_note: "A process communicating with a port via one of the erlang:port_* BIFs could potentially end up in an inconsistent state if the port terminated during the communication. When this occurred the process could later block in a receive even though it had messages matching in its message queue.\n\nThis bug was introduced in erts version 5.10 (OTP R16A).\n\n"

Typically happens when the last character of an UTF8 string is in the range 128 to 255, but truncated to only one byte.
