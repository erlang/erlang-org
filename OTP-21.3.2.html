        release_note: "If a suspend/resume signal pair was sent to a process while it was executing dirty, the receiving process could later end up in a suspended state indefinitely. This bug was introduced in ERTS version 10.0 (OTP 21.0).\n\nSuspend/resume signals are sent from erlang:suspend_process()/erlang:resume_process(). The dbg trace tool utilize this functionality and could thus trigger this bug.\n\n"
