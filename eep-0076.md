EEP 76: Priority Messages
----

Abstract
========

In some scenarios it is important to propagate certain information to a process
quickly without the receiving process having to search the whole message queue
which can become very inefficient if the message queue is long. This EEP
introduces the concept of priority messages to the language which
aim to solve this issue.

Motivation
==========

Asynchronous signaling is *the Erlang way* of communicating between processes.
The message signal is the most common type of signal. When a message signal is
received, it is added to the end of the message queue of the receiving process.
As a result of this, the messages in the message queue will be ordered in
reception order. When the receiving process fetch a message from the message
queue, using the `receive` expression, it begins searching at the start of the
message queue. Searching for a matching message is an `O(N)` operation where
`N` equals the amount of messages preceding the matching message.

Figure 1.

This works great in most cases, but in certain scenarios it does not work at
all. At least not without paying a huge performance penalty.

A Couple of Problematic Scenarios
---------------------------------

### Long Message Queue Notification

As of Erlang/OTP 27.0 it is possible to set up a system monitor monitoring the
message queue lengths of processes in the system. When a message queue length
exceeds a certain limit, you might want to change strategy of handling incoming
messages. In order to do that, you typically need to inform the process with a
long message queue about this.

Sending it a message informing about the long message queue will not work,
since this message will end up at the end of the long message queue. If the
receiver handles messages one at a time in message queue order, it will take a
long time until the receiver fetch this message. The situation will at this
point very likely have become even worse.

If the receiver instead periodically tries to search for such messages using
a selective receive, it will periodically have to do a lot of work. This
especially when the message queue is long. Polling the message queue length
using `process_info/2` will in this case be a better workaround. That is,
communicating this information between processes using asynchronous signaling
does not work in this scenario, or at least work very poorly.

### Prioritized Termination

Prioritized termination is another scenario that has similar issues. A worker
process that handles large jobs is supervised in a supervision tree. It is easy
to envision that such a worker could get a large amount of requests in its
message queue. If the supervisor dies or wants the worker to terminate, the
worker will receive an exit signal from its supervisor. If the worker traps
exits, the corresponding `'EXIT'` message will end up at the end of the message
queue.

If one wants to be able to terminate the worker prior to having to handle all
other requests in the message queue, one either has to stop trapping exits or
periodically do selective receives searching for such `'EXIT'` messages. Not
trapping exits might not be an option and doing periodical selective receives
will be very expensive if the message queue is long. [Pull request 8371][]
aimed to solve this scenario.

A workaround in this scenario could be to poll the supervisor using the
`is_process_alive/1` BIF in combination with polling of an ETS table where the
supervisor can order it to terminate. That is, this is another scenario in
which communicating information between processes using asynchronous signaling
either does not work or performs very poorly.

Polling Workarounds
-------------------

In order to be able to solve scenarios like these without the risk of having to
do a lot of work in the receiving process, one have to resort to passing the
information other ways and let the receiver poll for that information. For
example, write something into an ETS table and let the receiver poll that ETS
table for information. This will prevent potentially very large costs of
having to repeatedly do selective receives, but the polling will not be for
free either.

In order to be able to handle scenarios like the ones above using asynchronous
signaling, which is *the Erlang way* to communicate between processes, the
following mechanism for sending and receiving priority messages between
processes is proposed.

Rationale
=========

By letting certain messages get priority status and upon reception of such
messages insert them before ordinary messages in the message queue we can
handle scenarios like the above with very little overhead. Besides getting a
solution that most likely will have less overhead than any workaround for
communicating information like this, we also get a solution where asynchronous
signaling between processes can still be used.

The proposed handling of priority messages in the message queue:

![Priority Message Reception][]

Figure 2.

There will be no way for the Erlang code to distinguishing a priority message
from an ordinary message when fetching a message from the message queue. Such
knowledge needs to be part of the message protocol that the process should
adhere to.

The total message queue length in figure 2 equals `P+M`. The lengths `P` and
`M` will not be visible. The only visible length is the total message queue
length.

A `receive` expression will select the first message, from the start, in the
message queue that matches, just as before.

How to Insert Priority Messages in the Message Queue?
-----------------------------------------------------

By letting priority messages overtake ordinary messages that already exist in
the message queue we get priority messages ordered in reception order among
priority messages followed by ordinary messages ordered in reception order
among ordinary messages. Instead of just overtaking ordinary messages, one
could choose to let a priority message overtake all messages in the message
queue regardless of whether they are priority messages or not, but then
multiple priority messages would accumulate in reverse order. Having these two
sets of messages ordered internally by reception order at least to me feels the
most useful. Just as in the case of ordinary messages we will probably want to
handle priority messages in reception order.

Note that the reception order of signals is not changed. If a process sends an
ordinary message and then a priority message to a another process, the ordinary
message will be received first and then the priority message will be received.
The only difference is that when the priority message is received, it will be
inserted earlier in the message queue than the ordinary message. That is,
[the signal ordering guarantee][] of the language will still be respected. This
just modifies how the message queue is managed.

How to Determine What Should be a Priority Message?
---------------------------------------------------

By introducing priority messages, the messages in the queue will not
necessarily be in the order the corresponding signals were received. There will
be a lot of code that assumes that the order of messages in the message queue
is in reception order, so it is reasonable that one should need to opt-in in
order to be able to receive priority messages.

This EEP propose that selected priority marked messages, selected exit
messages, and selected monitor messages should be treated as priority messages.
Perhaps one would want other types of messages to be treated as priority
messages as well, but the set of allowed priority messages can easily be
extended in the future if that should be the case.

### Priority Aliases

The way you opt-in for allowing other processes to send you priority messages
consists of two steps. First you create a process alias, by calling the
`alias/1` BIF, and pass it the `priority` option in the option list. Such an
alias is from here on known as a *priority process alias* or shorter a
*priority alias*. When you have created the priority alias, you distribute the
alias to other processes that are to be able to send you priority messages.
The distribution may possibly be made via other processes.

The way of opting in by creating and distributing priority aliases to other
processes that should be able to send you priority messages, is more or less
the same way as you opt-in for allowing other processes to send you ordinary
messages. When it comes to ordinary messages, you opt-in by distributing your
process identifier to the processes that should be able to send you messages.
The implementer of a program creating priority aliases determine how limited
the possibility of sending priority messages should be by distributing the
priority aliases to a smaller or larger set of processes. That is, the
implementer can prevent abuse of priority messages by other parts of the
software by limiting how priority aliases are distributed.

A process that has access to the priority alias can send a priority message, to
the process that created the alias, using the `erlang:send/3` BIF by passing
the priority alias as first argument and the option `priority` in the option
list as third argument. The creator of the priority alias can deactivate it, for
example, by calling the `unalias/1` BIF with the priority alias as argument.

By requiring that the sender pass a priority alias created as well as
passing the `priority` option to the `erlang:send/3` BIF in order for the
message to be handled as a priority message, the process alias can also be used
for passing messages with normal priority. This will in some scenarios remove
the need for distributing both a process alias and a process identifier. In
order to simplify such scenarios one probably want to have the ability to
monitor active process aliases using the `monitor()` BIF. This is however left
as a future extension, since it is not needed for a lot of scenarios.

Similar to explicitly sending a priority message, a priority exit signal can
be sent using a priority alias and the new `exit/3` BIF where the third
argument is an option list where the `priority` option can be passed. If the
empty list is passed as third argument and a process identifier is passed as
first argument, the `exit/3` BIF it behaves as the `exit/2` BIF of behaves
today.

### Signals Triggered on Special Events

An exit signal sent due to a broken link cannot be marked as a priority exit
signal using a priority alias since it is not sent by another process calling
a function like `send/3` or `exit/3`. Instead the receiver of a priority exit
signal due to a broken link needs to mark that it wants the exit signal to be
handled as a priority exit signal by passing the `priority` option in an option
list as second argument to the new `link/2` BIF. The link will be set up and
be handled as today with the exception that the process that called the
`link/2` BIF with the `priority` option will receive a priority exit signal
if the link is broken.

If a link already exists when the `link/2` BIF with the `priority` option is
called, the link remains but will be marked for priority handling. If a link
which has been marked for priority handling already exists when the `link/2`
BIF without the `priority` option or the `link/1` BIF is called, the link will
remain, but the priority handling will be disabled.

Note that priority exit signals will not have any other behavior than today
unless the receiver is trapping exits. This since the priority messages only
affects how messages are moved into the message queue after a signal has been
received. If the receiver is not trapping exits, no message will be moved into
the message queue.

Similar to an exit signal sent due to a broken link, a monitor message is
triggered at some event occurring in the system and there is no function called
by the sender in order to send the signal. That is, it is not possible to use
priority aliases in order to control such priority handling. The receiver of
a priority monitor message needs to mark that it wants the monitor message as
a priority message by passing the new `priority` option in the option list to
the `monitor/3` BIF.

It is intentionally not possible to select all exit and monitor messages as
priority messages. This since that would easily introduce bugs when code in
other modules are called from the process accepting priority messages. For
example, if a process enables all monitor messages as priority messages and
then makes a call into a module that makes a `gen_server` call, a `'DOWN'`
message due to the call could be selected even though a reply message due to
the call had been delivered before the `'DOWN'` message. In this case, the call
operation would fail even though it actually succeeded. The reply message would
then also be left as garbage in the message queue without any code picking it
up.

Reception of a Priority Message
-------------------------------

At signal reception, the receiver checks whether or not the signal should be
accepted as a message to move into the message queue or if another action
should be taken, for example, silently drop the signal. If accepted as a
message to move into the message queue and also accepted as a priority message,
the priority message will overtake all ordinary messages in the message queue
and will be inserted after the last accepted priority message in the queue;
otherwise, if not accepted as a priority message, it will be treated as an
ordinary message and will be inserted at the end of the message queue. See
figure 2. Once a message has been inserted into the message queue, it will not
be moved in the message queue. The only operations that can affect its place in
the message queue is removal of messages due to execution of the `receive`
expression and insertion of new messages due to incoming signals.

All information needed in order to determine whether or not a message should be
handled as a priority message is readily available in the local state of the
receiving process and can be checked with negligible cost. In the case of a
message or exit signal sent using a alias, the receiver checks that the alias
is marked as a priority alias and still active. In case of other exit signals
transformed into messages this is marked in the process local link information,
and in case of a monitor message this is marked in the process local monitor
information.

The Selective Receive Optimization
----------------------------------

Current Erlang runtime system has a selective receive optimization that can
prevent the need to search large parts of the message queue for a matching
message. It is triggered when a reference is created and then matched against
in all clauses of a `receive` expression. Messages present in the message queue
when the reference is created do not have to be inspected, since they cannot
contain the reference.

When the optimization is triggered a marker is inserted into the message queue
and only messages after the marker are searched. This optimization can make a
huge impact on performance if the process has a long message queue. This
optimization is frequently used in OTP code such as, for example, in a
`gen_server` call.

The insertion of a priority message in the message queue clashes with the
receive optimization since a reference now can appear earlier in the message
queue than where the receive marker was inserted. One solution to this problem
could be to disable the selective receive optimization on processes that
enables priority messages. The user of priority messages would in that case
have to be very careful not to call into modules that might rely on the
selective receive optimization. This would more or less make it impossible to
safely call modules that you don't have full control over yourself, since it
in the future might be modified in a way so that it relies on the selective
receive optimization taking effect. Therefore I find it unacceptable to disable
the selective receive optimization. The priority message implementation must
preserve the selective receive optimization.

Distributed Erlang
------------------

Handling of priority messages should be completely distribution transparent.
You should be able to send and receive priority messages between nodes the
same way as done locally.

Alternative Solutions Considered
--------------------------------

A separate priority message queue per process exposed to the Erlang program
could be an alternative solution. You would need a way similar to this
proposal to choose which messages should be accepted as priority messages.
There would also need to be some new syntax in order to multiplex matching of
messages from the different message queues. This would be a larger change of
the language without providing any extra benefits as I see it. In order to use
such a change one would also need to modify the APIs of all generic behaviors
which would be a large change.

There have been suggestions for multiple priority levels similar to the process
priority levels. This could be viewed as an extension to this proposal. The
implementation could relatively easily be extended with multiple priority
levels even though it would complicate the implementation. A `low` priority
level similar to the process priority level `low` which is mixed with the
`normal` process priority level would be very strange to introduce, though.
This since there would not be any easy way of understanding which message will
be fetched from the message queue at a specific message queue state. I think
multiple priority levels should be left for the future if a good enough use
case is presented.

After the first publication of this EEP, two alternate solutions have been
proposed in [the forum thread about this EEP][]. Firstly the use of match
specifications in order to index the message queue, and secondly the use of
tagged tuples in order to determine if a message is a priority message. They
are similar since in both cases an inspection of each message is needed. This
is also my main objection to both of these approaches. This will put even more
work onto processes that are already having trouble keeping up with messages
passed to them. This more or less defeats the purpose of this feature. An
optimization proposed is to move the work of inspecting messages from the
receiver to the sender. This would, however, introduce synchronization needs
between the sender and the receiver which would be especially problematic for
the distributed scenario.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

Since the receiver process needs to opt-in in order to get any special handling
of priority messages, this will be completely backwards compatible.

Summary
=======

The proposed solution for priority messages enables users to solve problems
using asynchronous signaling, which is *the Erlang way* of communicating,
where they previously had to resort to workarounds using polling of some sort.
It is likely to reduce the performance impact in most, if not all, scenarios
where one otherwise needs to resort to polling of some sort. Since you need to
opt-in to this new behavior it is completely backwards compatible. The changes
to the language are very small, just "a light touch". On the conceptual level,
it is very easy to understand how the priority messaging works assuming that
you understand how asynchronous signaling in the language work.

Reference Implementation
========================

The reference implementation can be found in [pull request 9269][] of the
[Erlang/OTP repository][].

Care has been taken to have as small impact on performance and memory as
possible especially for processes not using priority messages.

A Few Notes on the Implementation
---------------------------------

### The Message Queue

The message queue may contain messages as well as receive markers used by the
selective receive optimization. Receive markers are currently also used for
adjustments that needs to be done to the message queue during certain
operations. That is, the current code traversing the message queue needs to be
prepared to encounter receive markers of different types.

When the user enables reception of priority messages, a block containing two
receive markers and an area for auxiliary data is allocated. The receive
markers in this memory block are of new types distinguishable from the already
existing receive markers. All memory allocated for handling of priority
messages is referred to from this memory block.

This memory block for priority message reception is referred to from *process
specific data*. Process specific data is only used by processes that enable
functionality that seldom is used. Since the memory used for priority message
reception is referred to from process specific data, memory usage will only
increase for processes using process specific data. If such processes have not
enabled priority message reception, only one machine word more of data will be
used.

While no priority messages exist in the message queue, handling of messages is
done exactly the same way for a process that has enabled priority message
reception as for a process that has not. When a priority message is accepted
into the message queue, a *priority message end marker* is inserted at the
start of the message queue and then the priority message is inserted just
before the marker. If yet another priority message is accepted while the first
priority message still is in the queue, it will be inserted just before the
priority message end marker. The priority message end marker will remain in the
message queue until no priority messages exist in the queue. At that point, the
priority message end marker will be removed form the queue.

The second marker is inserted in the message queue when we need to remember a
place in the message queue. This is needed when a priority message is accepted
while we currently are traversing the message queue.

#### Receive Optimization

If we have active receive markers for the selective receive optimization in the
message queue and a priority message is accepted, we scan the message for
references. If a reference corresponding to a receive marker is found, we mark
in the receive marker that the reference has been seen in the part of the
message queue containing priority messages. When we enter a `receive`
expression where a receive marker is used and it has been marked in the
receive marker that the reference has been seen in a priority message, we
search the priority messages prior to continuing with the messages after the
receive marker.

A further optimization that could be done to the receive optimization is to
insert yet another receive marker before the first priority message containing
the reference, but I see that as a premature optimization. A process is not
expected to accumulate a large amount of priority messages. If so, the process
has used priority messages in a way not intended.

### Determining if a Message Should be Accepted as a Priority Message

We more or less have two scenarios. In the first scenario, the signal was sent
by calling the `erlang:send/3` BIF or the `erlang:exit/3` BIF using a priority
alias and the `priority` option. In the second scenario, the signal was sent
due to a link being broken or a monitor being triggered where the link or
monitor was set up by calling the `link/2` BIF or the `monitor/3` BIF with the
`priority` option.

We first look at the first scenario. The receiver already has local information
about all active aliases for itself. When an alias message is received, it
looks up the local information about the alias. If the alias has been created
using the `priority` option, a priority bit is set in the local information
about the alias. A signal which has been sent using the `priority` option also
contains a bit set indicating that the priority option was used. In order to
determine whether or not to accept a signal as a priority message, the receiver
only needs to check that both of these priority bits are set.

When it comes to the second scenario. If an exit signal due to a broken link
or a monitor signal due to a triggered monitor should be handled as a priority
message, the link should have been set up by the `link/2` BIF using the
`priority` option or the monitor should have been set up by the `monitor/3`
BIF using the `priority` option. In both cases, a priority bit will be set in
the local information about the link or monitor. When such a signal is
received, the receiver only needs to check if the priority bit is set in the
local data in order to determine if it should be accepted as a priority
message or not.

In both scenarios, the receiving process has local data associated with the
signal that it already needs to look up unrelated to priority messages. The
only extra work due to priority messages that it needs to do is to check if
the priority bit is set in this local data, and for signals sent using the
`erlang:send/3` or `erlang:exit/3` BIFs also check if the priority bit is set
in the signal. In other words, the operation of determining whether or not a
message should be accepted as a priority message is extremely cheap.

### Priority Messages in Transit

There exists a number of different types of signals. For each type of signal an
action is taken when the signal is received. Ordinary messages are special
since they are very common and the only action taken upon reception of an
ordinary message is to add it to the end of the message queue. Due to this,
the signal queue for incoming signals is arranged as a skip list where each
non-ordinary message signal points to the next non-ordinary message signal.
This way we can move a whole batch of ordinary messages into the message queue
at once.

Priority marked message signals need to be sent as non-ordinary message
signals, since they need to have another action taken than the default. There
are other signals that are received as non-ordinary message signals, but then
transformed into ordinary messages depending on the state of the receiving
process. An example of such a signal is a message sent using an alias. Upon
reception of such a message the receiver checks if the alias is still active.
If it is, then adds it to the end of the message queue; otherwise, it drops the
message. Since a message sent using an alias is very similar to a priority
marked message, the implementation for alias messages has been generalized to
handle *alternate action messages*. Both a priority marked message and a
message sent using an alias are just messages with an alternate action to take
upon reception than the default, so both of them will use the alternate action
message implementation.
