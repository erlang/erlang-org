        release_note: "*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***\n\nTruly asynchronous auto-connect. Earlier, when erlang:send was aimed toward an unconnected node, the function would not return until the connection setup had completed (or failed). Now the function returns directly after the message has been enqueued and the connection setup started.\n\nThe same applies to all distributed operations that may trigger auto-connect, i.e. '!', send, link, monitor, monitor_node, exit/2 and group_leader.\n\nThe interface for all these functions are unchanged as they do not return connection failures. The only exception is erlang:monitor where a *possible incompatibility* is introduced: An attempt to monitor a process on a primitive node (such as erl_interface or jinterface), where remote process monitoring is not implemented, will no longer fail with badarg exception. Instead a monitor will be created, but it will only supervise the connection to the node.\n\n"

        release_note: "A new logging API is added to Erlang/OTP, see the logger(3) manual page, and section Logging in the Kernel User's Guide.\n\nCalls to error_logger are automatically redirected to the new API, and legacy error logger event handlers can still be used. It is, however, recommended to use the Logger API directly when writing new code.\n\nNotice the following potential incompatibilities:\n\n-- Kernel configuration parameters error_logger still works, but is overruled if the default handler's output destination is configured with Kernel configuration parameter logger.\n\nIn general, parameters for configuring error logger are overwritten by new parameters for configuring Logger.\n\n-- The concept of SASL error logging is deprecated, meaning that by default the SASL application does not affect which log events are logged.\n\nBy default, supervisor reports and crash reports are logged by the default Logger handler started by Kernel, and end up at the same destination (terminal or file) as other standard log event from Erlang/OTP.\n\nProgress reports are not logged by default, but can be enabled by setting the primary log level to info, for example with the Kernel configuration parameter logger_level.\n\nTo obtain backwards compatibility with the SASL error logging functionality from earlier releases, set Kernel configuration parameter logger_sasl_compatible to true. This prevents the default Logger handler from logging any supervisor-, crash-, or progress reports. Instead, SASL adds a separate Logger handler during application start, which takes care of these log events. The SASL configuration parameters sasl_error_logger and sasl_errlog_type specify the destination (terminal or file) and severity level to log for these events.\n\nSince Logger is new in Erlang/OTP 21.0, we do reserve the right to introduce changes to the Logger API and functionality in patches following this release. These changes might or might not be backwards compatible with the initial version.\n\n"

        release_note: "*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***\n\nA new logging API is added to Erlang/OTP, see the logger(3) manual page, and section Logging in the Kernel User's Guide.\n\nCalls to error_logger are automatically redirected to the new API, and legacy error logger event handlers can still be used. It is, however, recommended to use the Logger API directly when writing new code.\n\nNotice the following potential incompatibilities:\n\n-- Kernel configuration parameters error_logger still works, but is overruled if the default handler's output destination is configured with Kernel configuration parameter logger.\n\nIn general, parameters for configuring error logger are overwritten by new parameters for configuring Logger.\n\n-- The concept of SASL error logging is deprecated, meaning that by default the SASL application does not affect which log events are logged.\n\nBy default, supervisor reports and crash reports are logged by the default Logger handler started by Kernel, and end up at the same destination (terminal or file) as other standard log event from Erlang/OTP.\n\nProgress reports are not logged by default, but can be enabled by setting the primary log level to info, for example with the Kernel configuration parameter logger_level.\n\nTo obtain backwards compatibility with the SASL error logging functionality from earlier releases, set Kernel configuration parameter logger_sasl_compatible to true. This prevents the default Logger handler from logging any supervisor-, crash-, or progress reports. Instead, SASL adds a separate Logger handler during application start, which takes care of these log events. The SASL configuration parameters sasl_error_logger and sasl_errlog_type specify the destination (terminal or file) and severity level to log for these events.\n\nSince Logger is new in Erlang/OTP 21.0, we do reserve the right to introduce changes to the Logger API and functionality in patches following this release. These changes might or might not be backwards compatible with the initial version.\n\n"

It is, however, recommended to use the Logger API directly when writing new code.\n\nNotice the following potential incompatibilities:\n\n-- Kernel configuration parameters error_logger still works, but is overruled if the default handler's output destination is configured with Kernel configuration parameter logger.\n\nIn general, parameters for configuring error logger are overwritten by new parameters for configuring Logger.\n\n-- The concept of SASL error logging is deprecated, meaning that by default the SASL application does not affect which log events are logged.\n\nBy default, supervisor reports and crash reports are logged by the default Logger handler started by Kernel, and end up at the same destination (terminal or file) as other standard log event from Erlang/OTP.\n\nProgress reports are not logged by default, but can be enabled by setting the primary log level to info, for example with the Kernel configuration parameter logger_level.\n\nTo obtain backwards compatibility with the SASL error logging functionality from earlier releases, set Kernel configuration parameter logger_sasl_compatible to true. This prevents the default Logger handler from logging any supervisor-, crash-, or progress reports. Instead, SASL adds a separate Logger handler during application start, which takes care of these log events. The SASL configuration parameters sasl_error_logger and sasl_errlog_type specify the destination (terminal or file) and severity level to log for these events.\n\nSince Logger is new in Erlang/OTP 21.0, we do reserve the right to introduce changes to the Logger API and functionality in patches following this release.
