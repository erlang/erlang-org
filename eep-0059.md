EEP 59: Module attributes for documentation
----

Abstract
========

This EEP proposes a structured documentation API for Erlang where the
documentation is handled as part of the language parser and included
directly in the compiled .beam files, as a replacement for EDoc style
comments.  Python, Elixir, and Clojure are examples of languages that
follow this approach of treating documentation as data rather than code
comments.

Rationale
=========

The main limitation in EDoc today is that the documentation is kept as
code comments.  This requires an explicit tool to parse said code
comments, which complicates access to the docs by IDEs, from the shell,
etc.  There have been recent improvements in this area by making EDoc
compile to [EEP 48] but it still requires an explicit step.

Furthermore, the “code comments” approach is more complex implementation
wise, as it requires parsing the source code alongside code comments,
parsing the code comments, and so on.  It is also beneficial to have an
explicit distinction between documentation and code comments: they have
different requirements and different audiences.

This EEP proposes the addition of two module attributes to Erlang: `-doc`
and `-moduledoc`.

As with [EEP 48], this proposal pertains exclusively to API references and
their documentation.  It doesn't cover guides, tutorials, and other
documentation formats.

New module attributes
=====================

This EEP proposes two new attributes: `-doc` and `-moduledoc`.  They could
be used as follows:

```erlang
-module(base64).
-moduledoc "
Convenience functions for encoding and decoding from base64.
".

-doc "
Encodes the given binary to base64.
".
-spec encode(binary()) -> binary().
encode(Binary) ->
  % ....

-doc "
Decodes the given binary from base64.
".
-spec decode(binary()) -> {ok, binary()} | error.
encode(Binary) ->
  % ....
```

The new `-moduledoc` attribute can be listed anywhere and it will contain
the documentation for the given module.  The `-doc` attribute must be
listed anywhere before a function, type attribute or callback attribute and it will
contain the documentation for the following function, type or callback.  For instance,
the example below:

```erlang
-doc "Example".
-spec example() -> ok.
example() -> ok.
```

is equivalent to:

```erlang
-spec example() -> ok.
-doc "Example".
example() -> ok.
```

Listing multiple `-doc` attributes with string values for the same
function should warn or error accordingly. The examples below should error:

```erlang
-doc "Example".
-doc "Updated example".
example() -> ok.
```

<!-- split examples -->

```erlang
-doc "Example".
example(one) -> 1;
-doc "Updated example".
example(two) -> 2;
```

Hidden docs
-----------

The module attribute must either be a string OR the atom `false`.
Marking a module as hidden means it won't be part of the doc.
For example, imagine the `base64` module above delegates some of
its logic to a private `base64_impl` module:

```erlang
-module(base64_impl).
-moduledoc false.
```

Note a module may be hidden but individual functions can still be
documented:

```erlang
-module(base64_impl).
-moduledoc false.

-doc "
Some comments as if it was public.
".
decode64(Binary) ->
  % ...
```

According to [EEP 48], this is intentional. For example, `base64_impl`
should be private for users of the `base64` functionality, but a
developer working directly on the `base64` may still want to access
the docs for `base64_impl` functions directly from their IDE. Each
documentation tool should honor `hidden` accordingly. If no `-doc`
is provided, it defaults to `none` according to [EEP 48].

The `-doc` attribute accepts the `false` atom too.

File/include docs
-----------------

Some developers prefer to not place the documentation alongside the
source code.  For such cases, `-doc` and `-moduledoc` may also provide
a `{file, Path}`, where `Path` is a relative path from file containing the
doc attribute:

```erlang
-moduledoc({file, "../doc/src/manual/my_module.asciidoc"}).
-doc({file, "../doc/src/manual/my_module.my_function.asciidoc"}).
```

The file will be read by the compiler and embedded into the chunk at
compilation time.

Callbacks and types
-------------------

The `-doc` attribute can also be used to document types and callbacks.

Private functions
-----------------

The `-doc` attribute can be used for private function as well, so that
tools and IDEs can provide docs if the user wants them to. However,
the private function should not end up in the [EEP 48] doc chunk.

Private types
-------------

In general private types are handled just as private functions,
however there are times when types are used for documentation
and code-sharing purposes within a module, but the user does not
want to export it for general use. An example of this are all
the various option types in the ssl module.

Therefore any private type that is referred to by a public function
specification or type will also be included in the documentation chunks.
Such types will have the `exported` metadata key set to `false`.

Metadata
--------

The new module attributes must also support documentation metadata
by passing a map as argument:

```erlang
-module(beam64).
-moduledoc "
Convenience functions for encoding and decoding from base64.
".
-moduledoc #{
  author => [<<"The Erlang/OTP team">>],
  license => <<"Apache 2 License">>,
  cross_references => [binary]
}.
```

If the `-moduledoc` is called multiple times with a map, the maps will
be merged.  This comes with the added benefit that shared metadata can
be moved to a header file:

```erlang
%% prelude.hrl
-moduledoc #{
  authors => [<<"The Erlang/OTP team">>],
  license => <<"Apache 2 License">>
}.
```

which we can then include and augment:

```erlang
-module(beam64).
-include("prelude.hrl").
-moduledoc "
Convenience functions for encoding and decoding from base64.
".
-moduledoc #{cross_references => [binary]}.
```

A list of built-in attributes is available on [EEP 48].

Compilation
-----------

Compiling a module with the `-moduledoc` or `-doc` attributes will generate a
Docs chunk into its .beam file, making the documentation directly accessible in
the shell.

Release tools should also prune the Documentation chunk out of .beam
files by default.  Note this is already done by `beam_lib:strip_release/1`
and `beam_lib:strip_files/1`.

### `warn_missing_doc`

The compiler will warn if a function, type or callback that is included
in the [EEP 48] doc chunk does not have a `-doc` attribute set if the
`warn_missing_doc` flag is passed to the compiler.

The flag can be passed both on the command line as `+warn_missing_doc`,
or as a `-compile(warn_missing_doc)` attribute the source code.

Documentation format
--------------------

One important discussion about documentation is what is the documentation
format that the documentation should adopt.  Luckily, [EEP 48] is agnostic
to the format, however one must still be listed.

In order to facilitate multiple documentation formats Erlang/OTP allows the
user to place a `format` key in the `-moduledoc` metadata which should specify
the mime type of the format used, as specified by [EEP 48]. The default format
will be `text/markdown`.

```erlang
-moduledoc(#{ format => "text/edoc" }).
```

Other topics
==============

Doctests
--------

A direct consequence of making the documentation more structured
and accessible is that Erlang can include doctests, which is the
ability to run and validate the examples in your documentation.
For example, someone could write this:

```erlang
-doc """
Encodes the given binary to base64.

1> base64:encode("hello").
<<"aGVsbG8=">>

""".
-spec encode(binary()) -> binary().
encode(Binary) ->
  % ....
```

And then in your test suite:

```erlang
doctests(_Config) ->
  ct_doctest:run(base64).
```

The doctest attribute will access the documentation entries in
the base64 Docs chunk, extract all of the examples, and run them.
Of course, while there is nothing stopping doctests from being
implemented on top of EDoc today, this EEP makes doctests
considerably simpler to implement.

Doctests would benefit from a separate EEP, as there are some extra
considerations, as doctesting exceptions, unparseable formats, etc,
but it is worth mentioning them given their benefits to users and
documentation authors.

What about EDoc and `erl_docgen`?
---------------------------------

If this proposal is to be accepted, what happens with Edoc?

One important aspect of the work proposed by the EEP is to try and
unify the documentation tools in the Erlang/OTP ecosystem. Before
this, there have been multiple tools, EDoc mostly being used by
open source projects, and `erl_docgen` by the Erlang/OTP project,
and other third party solutions.

In the short-term, EDoc will be updated to be able to generate
html reports from [EEP 48] doc chunks containing `text/edoc`
documentation. The EDoc comment style of specifying documentation
will be deprecated, however, for backwards compatibility the support
to parse the EDoc comments will remain for a long time.

In the long term, the aim is to switch document rendering engine to
use [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc/), which supports
Erlang projects either by running it as an escript or via Rebar3
integration. When using ExDoc, the user can choose to either use
EDoc syntax or migrate to Markdown.

Similarly, the Erlang/OTP code will be converted to use ExDoc
instead of `erl_docgen` to generate documentation. All the current
XML documentation files will be converted to use Markdown.
