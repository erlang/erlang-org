        release_note: "If a runtime system which was starting the distribution already had existing pids, ports, or references referring to a node with the same nodename/creation pair that the runtime system was about to use, these already existing pids, ports, or references would not work as expected in various situations after the node had gone alive. This could only occur if the runtime system was communicated such pids, ports, or references prior to the distribution was started. That is, it was extremely unlikely to happen unless the distribution was started dynamically and was even then very unlikely to happen. The runtime system now checks for already existing pids, ports, and references with the same nodename/creation pair that it is about to use. If such are found another creation will be chosen in order to avoid these issues.\n\n"
