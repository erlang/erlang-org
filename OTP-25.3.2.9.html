        release_note: "32-bit runtime systems on most Unix like platforms could crash if a BIF timer was set with a huge timeout of more than 68 years into the future. In order for the crash to occur, the huge timer (at a later time than when it was set) had to become the nearest active timer set on the specific scheduler on which it was set. This could not happen on a system with only one scheduler since there would always be shorter timers in the system.\n\nSetting a timer larger than 49 days on Windows could under rare circumstances cause the timeout to be delayed.\n\n"
