        release_note: "Add missing documentation of new external tags NEW_PID, NEW_PORT and NEWER_REFERENCE introduced in OTP 19.\n\nThese new tags are planned to be \"activated\" in OTP 23 when distribution capability flag DFLAG_BIG_CREATION becomes mandatory. Older nodes (>= 19) are able to decode these new tags and send them back to the new node. Nodes older than OTP 23 will however never encode their own local pids, ports and references using the new tags.\n\n"
