To activate this bahviour the environment variable ERL_ZZ_SIGTERM_KILL should be set to \"true\". This option only works in OTP 19 as OTP 20 will have a different way to deal with SIGTERM.\n\n"

        release_note: "A couple of bugs are fixed in the sax parser (xmerl_sax_parser).\n\n-- The continuation function was not called correctly when the XML directive was fragmented.\n\n-- When the event callback modules (xmerl_sax_old_dom and xmerl_sax_simple) got an endDocument event at certain conditions the parser crashed.\n\n-- Replaced internal ets table with map to avoid table leakage.\n\n"
