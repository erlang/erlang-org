This is done by sending\nand receiving information to/from the process through a third process, called\nthe meta process. You can implement your own attached process. See `int.erl` for\navailable functions and `dbg_wx_trace.erl` for possible messages.\n\nThe interpreter depends on the Kernel, STDLIB, and WX applications. This means\nthat modules belonging to any of these applications are not allowed to be\ninterpreted, as it could lead to a deadlock or emulator crash.

One\nwindow is opened for each process that has been attached to. Notice that when\nattaching to a process, its execution is automatically stopped.\n\n![Attach Process Window](assets/attach.jpg \"Attach Process Window\")\n\nThe window is divided into the following five parts:\n\n- The Code area, displaying the code being executed. The code is indented and\n  each line is prefixed with its line number. If the process execution is\n  stopped, the current line is marked with `-->`. An existing break point at a\n  line is marked with a stop symbol. In the example shown in the illustration,\n  the execution stopped at line 6, before the execution of `fac/1`.\n\n  Active breakpoints are displayed in red and inactive breakpoints in blue.\n\n- The Button area, with buttons for quick access to frequently used functions in\n  the _Process_ menu.\n- The Evaluator area, where you can evaluate functions within the context of the\n  debugged process, if that process execution is stopped.\n- The Bindings area, displaying all variables bindings. If you click a variable\n  name, the value is displayed in the Evaluator area. Double-click a variable\n  name to open a window where the variable value can be edited. Notice however\n  that pid, port, reference, or fun values cannot be edited unless they can be\n  represented in the running system.\n- The Trace area, which displays a trace output for the process.\n\n  - **`++ (N)  `** - Function call, where `N` is the call level and `L` the\n    line number.\n\n  - **`-- (N)`** - Function return value\n\n    .\n\n  - **`==> Pid : Msg`** - The message `Msg` is sent to process `Pid`.\n\n  - **`<== Msg`** - The message `Msg` is received.\n\n  - **`++ (N) receive`** - Waiting in a `receive`.\n\n  - **`++ (N) receive with timeout`** - Waiting in a `receive...after`.\n\n  The Trace area also displays Back Trace, a summary of the current function\n  calls on the stack.\n\nUsing the _Options_ menu, you can set which areas to be displayed.
