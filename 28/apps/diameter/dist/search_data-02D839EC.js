For a connecting transport, the timing of connection attempts is\n    governed by [connect_timer](`m:diameter#connect_timer`) or\n    [watchdog_timer](`m:diameter#watchdog_timer`) expiry. For a listening\n    transport, the peer determines the timing.\n\n    Defaults to 10000.\n\n  - **`{connect_timer, Tc}`{: #connect_timer }**\n\n    ```text\n    Tc = Unsigned32()\n    ```\n\n    For a connecting transport, the RFC 6733 Tc timer, in milliseconds. This\n    timer determines the frequency with which a transport attempts to establish\n    an initial connection with its peer following transport configuration. Once\n    an initial connection has been established,\n    [watchdog_timer](`m:diameter#watchdog_timer`) determines the frequency of\n    reconnection attempts, as required by RFC 3539.\n\n    For a listening transport, the timer specifies the time after which a\n    previously connected peer will be forgotten: a connection after this time is\n    regarded as an initial connection rather than reestablishment, causing the\n    RFC 3539 state machine to pass to state OKAY rather than REOPEN. Note that\n    these semantics are not governed by the RFC and that a listening transport's\n    [connect_timer](`m:diameter#connect_timer`) should be greater than its\n    peer's Tw plus jitter.\n\n    Defaults to 30000 for a connecting transport and 60000 for a listening\n    transport.\n\n  - **`{disconnect_cb, `[`eval()`](`m:diameter#eval`)`}`{: #disconnect_cb }** -\n    Callback invoked prior to terminating the transport process of a transport\n    connection having watchdog state `OKAY`. Applied to\n    `application|service|transport` and the\n    [`transport_ref()`](`m:diameter#transport_ref`) and\n    [`diameter_app:peer()`](`t:diameter_app:peer/0`) in question: `application`\n    indicates that the diameter application is being stopped, `service` that the\n    service in question is being stopped by `stop_service/1`, and `transport`\n    that the transport in question is being removed by `remove_transport/2`.\n\n    The return value can have one of the following types.\n\n    - **`{dpr, [option()]}`** - Send Disconnect-Peer-Request to the peer, the\n      transport process being terminated following reception of\n      Disconnect-Peer-Answer or timeout. An `option()` can be one of the\n      following.\n\n      - **`{cause, 0|rebooting|1|busy|2|goaway}`** - Disconnect-Cause to send,\n        `REBOOTING`, `BUSY` and `DO_NOT_WANT_TO_TALK_TO_YOU` respectively.\n        Defaults to `rebooting` for `Reason=service|application` and `goaway`\n        for `Reason=transport`.\n\n      - **`{timeout, `[`Unsigned32()`](diameter_dict.md#DATA_TYPES)`}`** -\n        Number of milliseconds after which the transport process is terminated\n        if DPA has not been received. Defaults to the value of\n        [dpa_timeout](`m:diameter#dpa_timeout`).\n\n    - **`dpr`** - Equivalent to `{dpr, []}`.\n\n    - **`close`** - Terminate the transport process without\n      Disconnect-Peer-Request being sent to the peer.\n\n    - **`ignore`** - Equivalent to not having configured the callback.\n\n    Multiple [disconnect_cb](`m:diameter#disconnect_cb`) options can be\n    specified, in which case the corresponding callbacks are applied until one\n    of them returns a value other than `ignore`. All callbacks returning\n    `ignore` is equivalent to not having configured them.\n\n    Defaults to a single callback returning `dpr`.\n\n  - **`{dpa_timeout, `[`Unsigned32()`](diameter_dict.md#DATA_TYPES)`}`{:\n    #dpa_timeout }** - Number of milliseconds after which a transport connection\n    is terminated following an outgoing DPR if DPA is not received.\n\n    Defaults to 1000.\n\n  - **`{dpr_timeout, `[`Unsigned32()`](diameter_dict.md#DATA_TYPES)`}`{:\n    #dpr_timeout }** - Number of milliseconds after which a transport connection\n    is terminated following an incoming DPR if the peer does not close the\n    connection.\n\n    Defaults to 5000.\n\n  - **`{incoming_maxlen, 0..16777215}`{: #incoming_maxlen }** - Bound on the\n    expected size of incoming Diameter messages. Messages larger than the\n    specified number of bytes are discarded.\n\n    Defaults to `16777215`, the maximum value of the 24-bit Message Length field\n    in a Diameter Header.\n\n  - **`{length_errors, exit|handle|discard}`{: #length_errors }** - How to deal\n    with errors in the Message Length field of the Diameter Header in an\n    incoming message. An error in this context is that the length is not at\n    least 20 bytes (the length of a Header), is not a multiple of 4 (a valid\n    length) or is not the length of the message in question, as received over\n    the transport interface documented in `m:diameter_transport`.\n\n    If `exit` then the transport process in question exits. If `handle` then the\n    message is processed as usual, a resulting\n    [handle_request/3](`c:diameter_app:handle_request/3`) or\n    [handle_answer/4](`c:diameter_app:handle_answer/4`) callback (if one takes\n    place) indicating the `5015` error (DIAMETER_INVALID_MESSAGE_LENGTH). If\n    `discard` then the message in question is silently discarded.\n\n    Defaults to `exit`.\n\n    > #### Note {: .info }\n    >\n    > The default value reflects the fact that a transport module for a\n    > stream-oriented transport like TCP may not be able to recover from a\n    > message length error since such a transport must use the Message Length\n    > header to divide the incoming byte stream into individual Diameter\n    > messages.

See `m:diameter_tcp` for the behaviour of that module.\n\n  - **`{pool_size, pos_integer()}`** - Number of transport processes to start.\n    For a listening transport, determines the size of the pool of accepting\n    transport processes, a larger number being desirable for processing multiple\n    concurrent peer connection attempts. For a connecting transport, determines\n    the number of connections to the peer in question that will be attempted to\n    be establshed: the [service_opt()](`m:diameter#service_opt`):\n    `restrict_connections` should also be configured on the service in question\n    to allow multiple connections to the same peer.\n\n  - **`{spawn_opt, [term()] | {M,F,A}}`{: #spawn_opt }** - An options list\n    passed to `erlang:spawn_opt/2` to spawn a handler process for an incoming\n    Diameter request on the local node, or an MFA that returns the pid of a\n    handler process.\n\n    Options `monitor` and `link` are ignored in the list-valued case. An MFA is\n    applied with an additional term prepended to its argument list, and should\n    return either the pid of the handler process that invokes\n    `diameter_traffic:request/1` on the argument in order to process the\n    request, or the atom `discard`. The handler process need not be local, and\n    diameter need not be started on the remote node, but diameter and relevant\n    application callbacks must be on the code path.\n\n    Defaults to the empty list.\n\n  - **`{strict_capx, boolean()]}`{: #strict_capx }** - Whether or not to enforce\n    the RFC 6733 requirement that any message before capabilities exchange\n    should close the peer connection. If false then unexpected messages are\n    discarded.\n\n    Defaults to true. Changing this results in non-standard behaviour, but can\n    be useful in case peers are known to be behave badly.\n\n  - **`{strict_mbit, boolean()}`{: #strict_mbit }** - Whether or not to regard\n    an AVP setting the M-bit as erroneous when the command grammar in question\n    does not explicitly allow the AVP. If `true` then such AVPs are regarded as\n    5001 errors, DIAMETER_AVP_UNSUPPORTED. If `false` then the M-bit is ignored\n    and policing it becomes the receiver's responsibility.\n\n    Defaults to `true`.\n\n    > #### Warning {: .warning }\n    >\n    > RFC 6733 is unclear about the semantics of the M-bit.

Defaults to the empty list.\n\n    The 3-tuple form additionally specifies an interval, in milliseconds, after\n    which a started transport process should be terminated if it has not yet\n    established a connection. For example, the following options on a connecting\n    transport request a connection with one peer over SCTP or another (typically\n    the same) over TCP.\n\n    ```erlang\n    {transport_module, diameter_sctp}\n    {transport_config, SctpOpts, 5000}\n    {transport_module, diameter_tcp}\n    {transport_config, TcpOpts}\n    ```\n\n    To listen on both SCTP and TCP, define one transport for each.\n\n  - **`{transport_module, atom()}`{: #transport_module }** - Module implementing\n    a transport process as defined in `m:diameter_transport`. Defaults to\n    `diameter_tcp`.\n\n    Multiple `transport_module` and\n    [transport_config](`m:diameter#transport_config`) options are allowed. The\n    order of these is significant in this case (and only in this case), a\n    `transport_module` being paired with the first\n    [transport_config](`m:diameter#transport_config`) following it in the\n    options list, or the default value for trailing modules. Transport starts\n    will be attempted with each of the modules in order until one establishes a\n    connection within the corresponding timeout (see below) or all fail.\n\n  - **`{watchdog_config, [{okay|suspect, non_neg_integer()}]}`{:\n    #watchdog_config }** - Configuration that alters the behaviour of the\n    watchdog state machine.

Equivalent to\n\n  ```text\n  {reply, ['answer-message' | Avps]\n  ```\n\n  where `Avps` sets the Origin-Host, Origin-Realm, the specified Result-Code and\n  (if the request contained one) Session-Id AVPs, and possibly Failed-AVP as\n  described below.\n\n  Returning a value other than 3xxx or 5xxx will cause the request process in\n  question to fail, as will returning a 5xxx value if the peer connection in\n  question has been configured with the RFC 3588 common dictionary\n  `diameter_gen_base_rfc3588`. (Since RFC 3588 only allows 3xxx values in an\n  answer-message.)\n\n  When returning 5xxx, Failed-AVP will be populated with the AVP of the first\n  matching Result-Code/AVP pair in the `errors` field of the argument\n  [packet()](`t:packet/0`), if found. If this is not appropriate then\n  an answer-message should be constructed explicitly and returned in a `reply`\n  tuple instead.\n\n- **`{relay, Opts}`** - Relay a request to another peer in the role of a\n  Diameter relay agent. If a routing loop is detected then the request is\n  answered with 3005 (DIAMETER_LOOP_DETECTED). Otherwise a Route-Record AVP\n  (containing the sending peer's Origin-Host) is added to the request and\n  `c:pick_peer/4` and subsequent callbacks take place just as if\n  `diameter:call/4` had been called explicitly. The End-to-End Identifier of the\n  incoming request is preserved in the header of the relayed request.\n\n  The returned `Opts` should not specify `detach`. A subsequent\n  `c:handle_answer/4` callback for the relayed request must return its first\n  argument, the [packet()](`t:packet/0`) containing the answer\n  message. Note that the `extra` option can be specified to supply arguments\n  that can distinguish the relay case from others if so desired. Any other\n  return value (for example, from a `c:handle_error/4` callback) causes the\n  request to be answered with 3002 (DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_DELIVER).\n\n  This return value can be used only in relay applications\n  (Application identifier = 0xFFFFFFFF).\n\n- **`{proxy, Opts}`** - Like `relay` but can only be used in applications other\n  then the relay application.\n\n- **`{resend, Opts}`** - Neutral alternative to `relay` and `proxy` that can be\n  used in any application.\n\n- **`discard`** - Discard the request.

As a side effect, nominal types can encode opaque types. We changed all opaque-handling logic and improved opaque warnings in Dialyzer.\n  \n  All existing Erlang type systems are structural: two types are seen as equivalent if their structures are the same. Type comparisons are based on the structures of the types, not on how the user explicitly defines them. For example, in the following example, `meter()` and `foot()` are equivalent. The two types can be used interchangeably. Neither of them differ from the basic type `integer()`.\n  \n  ````\n  -type meter() :: integer().\n  -type foot() :: integer().\n  ````\n  \n  Nominal typing is an alternative type system, where two types are equivalent if and only if they are declared with the same type name. The EEP proposes one new syntax -nominal for declaring nominal types. Under nominal typing, `meter()` and `foot()` are no longer compatible. Whenever a function expects type `meter()`, passing in type `foot()` would result in a Dialyzer error.\n  \n  ````\n  -nominal meter() :: integer().\n  -nominal foot() :: integer().\n  ````\n  \n  More nominal type-checking rules can be found in the EEP. It is worth noting that most work for adding nominal types and type-checking is in `erl_types.erl`. The rest are changes that removed the previous opaque type-checking, and added an improved version of it using nominal type-checking with reworked warnings.\n  \n  Backwards compatibility for opaque type-checking is not preserved by this PR.

It supports arbitrary Diameter applications by way of a\n_dictionary_ interface that allows messages and AVPs to be defined and input\ninto diameter as configuration. It has support for all roles defined in the RFC:\nclient, server and agent. This chapter provides a short overview of the\napplication.\n\nA Diameter node is implemented by configuring a _service_ and one or more\n_transports_ using the interface module `m:diameter`. The service configuration\ndefines the Diameter applications to be supported by the node and, typically,\nthe capabilities that it should send to remote peers at capabilities exchange\nupon the establishment of transport connections. A transport is configured on a\nservice and provides protocol-specific send/receive functionality by way of a\ntransport interface defined by diameter and implemented by a transport module.\nThe diameter application provides two transport modules: `m:diameter_tcp` and\n`m:diameter_sctp` for transport over TCP (using `m:gen_tcp`) and SCTP (using\n`m:gen_sctp`) respectively. Other transports can be provided by any module that\nimplements diameter's [transport interface](`m:diameter_transport`).\n\nWhile a service typically implements a single Diameter node (as identified by an\nOrigin-Host AVP), transports can themselves be associated with capabilities AVPs\nso that a single service can be used to implement more than one Diameter node.\n\nEach Diameter application defined on a service is configured with a callback\nmodule that implements the [application interface](`m:diameter_app`) through\nwhich diameter communicates the connectivity of remote peers, requests peer\nselection for outgoing requests, and communicates the reception of incoming\nDiameter request and answer messages. An application using diameter implements\nthese application callback modules to provide the functionality of the Diameter\nnode(s) it implements.\n\nEach Diameter application is also configured with a dictionary module that\nprovide encode/decode functionality for outgoing/incoming Diameter messages\nbelonging to the application. A dictionary module is generated from a\n[dictionary file](diameter_dict.md) using the [diameterc](diameterc_cmd.md)\nutility. Dictionaries for the RFC 6733 Diameter Common Messages, Base Accounting\nand Relay applications are provided with the diameter application.","ref":"diameter_intro.html"},{"type":"extras","title":"Usage","doc":"<!--\n%CopyrightBegin%\n\nSPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0\n\nCopyright Ericsson AB 2023-2025.

Each Diameter application specifies a\ndictionary module that knows how to encode and decode its messages and AVPs. The\ndictionary module is in turn generated from a file that defines these messages\nand AVPs. The format of such a file is defined in\n[FILE FORMAT](diameter_dict.md#FILE_FORMAT) below. Users add support for their\nspecific applications by creating dictionary files, compiling them to Erlang\nmodules using either [diameterc(1)](diameterc_cmd.md) or `m:diameter_make` and\nconfiguring the resulting dictionaries modules on a service.\n\nDictionary module generation also results in a hrl file that defines records for\nthe messages and Grouped AVPs defined by the dictionary, these records being\nwhat a user of the diameter application sends and receives, modulo other\npossible formats as discussed in `m:diameter_app`. These records and the\nunderlying Erlang data types corresponding to Diameter data formats are\ndiscussed in [MESSAGE RECORDS](diameter_dict.md#MESSAGE_RECORDS) and\n[DATA TYPES](diameter_dict.md#DATA_TYPES) respectively. The generated hrl also\ncontains macro definitions for the possible values of AVPs of type Enumerated.\n\nThe diameter application includes five dictionary modules corresponding to\napplications defined in section 2.4 of RFC 6733: `diameter_gen_base_rfc3588` and\n`diameter_gen_base_rfc6733` for the Diameter Common Messages application with\napplication identifier 0, `diameter_gen_accounting` (for RFC 3588) and\n`diameter_gen_acct_rfc6733` for the Diameter Base Accounting application with\napplication identifier 3 and `diameter_gen_relay` the Relay application with\napplication identifier 0xFFFFFFFF.\n\nThe Common Message and Relay applications are the only applications that\ndiameter itself has any specific knowledge of. The Common Message application is\nused for messages that diameter itself handles: CER/CEA, DWR/DWA and DPR/DPA.\nThe Relay application is given special treatment with regard to encode/decode\nsince the messages and AVPs it handles are not specifically defined.\n\n[](){: #FILE_FORMAT }","ref":"diameter_dict.html#description"},{"type":"extras","title":"FILE FORMAT - diameter_dict","doc":"A dictionary file consists of distinct sections. Each section starts with a tag\nfollowed by zero or more arguments and ends at the the start of the next section\nor end of file. Tags consist of an ampersand character followed by a keyword and\nare separated from their arguments by whitespace. Whitespace separates\nindividual tokens but is otherwise insignificant.\n\nThe tags, their arguments and the contents of each corresponding section are as\nfollows. Each section can occur multiple times unless otherwise specified. The\norder in which sections are specified is unimportant.\n\n- **`@id Number`{: #id }** - Defines the integer Number as the Diameter\n  Application Id of the application in question. Can occur at most once and is\n  required if the dictionary defines `@messages`. The section has empty content.\n\n  The Application Id is set in the Diameter Header of outgoing messages of the\n  application, and the value in the header of an incoming message is used to\n  identify the relevant dictionary module.\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```text\n  @id 16777231\n  ```\n\n- **`@name Mod`{: #name }** - Defines the name of the generated dictionary\n  module. Can occur at most once and defaults to the name of the dictionary file\n  minus any extension. The section has empty content.\n\n  Note that a dictionary module should have a unique name so as not collide with\n  existing modules in the system.\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```text\n  @name etsi_e2\n  ```\n\n- **`@prefix Name`{: #prefix }** - Defines Name as the prefix to be added to\n  record and constant names (followed by a `'_'` character) in the generated\n  dictionary module and hrl. Can occur at most once. The section has empty\n  content.\n\n  A prefix is optional but can be be used to disambiguate between record and\n  constant names resulting from similarly named messages and AVPs in different\n  Diameter applications.\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```text\n  @prefix etsi_e2\n  ```\n\n- **`@vendor Number Name`{: #vendor }** - Defines the integer Number as the the\n  default Vendor-Id of AVPs for which the V flag is set. Name documents the\n  owner of the application but is otherwise unused. Can occur at most once and\n  is required if an AVP sets the V flag and is not otherwise assigned a\n  Vendor-Id. The section has empty content.\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```text\n  @vendor 13019 ETSI\n  ```\n\n- **`@avp_vendor_id Number`{: #avp_vendor_id }** - Defines the integer Number as\n  the Vendor-Id of the AVPs listed in the section content, overriding the\n  `@vendor` default. The section content consists of AVP names.\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```text\n  @avp_vendor_id 2937\n\n  WWW-Auth\n  Domain-Index\n  Region-Set\n  ```\n\n- **`@inherits Mod`{: #inherits }** - Defines the name of a dictionary module\n  containing AVP definitions that should be imported into the current\n  dictionary. The section content consists of the names of those AVPs whose\n  definitions should be imported from the dictionary, an empty list causing all\n  to be imported. Any listed AVPs must not be defined in the current dictionary\n  and it is an error to inherit the same AVP from more than one dictionary.\n\n  Note that an inherited AVP that sets the V flag takes its Vendor-Id from\n  either `@avp_vendor_id` in the inheriting dictionary or `@vendor` in the\n  inherited dictionary. In particular, `@avp_vendor_id` in the inherited\n  dictionary is ignored. Inheriting from a dictionary that specifies the\n  required `@vendor` is equivalent to using `@avp_vendor_id` with a copy of the\n  dictionary's definitions but the former makes for easier reuse.\n\n  All dictionaries should typically inherit RFC 6733 AVPs from\n  `diameter_gen_base_rfc6733`.\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```text\n  @inherits diameter_gen_base_rfc6733\n  ```\n\n- **`@avp_types`{: #avp_types }** - Defines the name, code, type and flags of\n  individual AVPs. The section consists of definitions of the form\n\n  `Name Code Type Flags`\n\n  where Code is the integer AVP code, Type identifies an AVP Data Format as\n  defined in section [DATA TYPES](diameter_dict.md#DATA_TYPES) below, and Flags\n  is a string of V, M and P characters indicating the flags to be set on an\n  outgoing AVP or a single `'-'` (minus) character if none are to be set.\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```text\n  @avp_types\n\n  Location-Information   350  Grouped     MV\n  Requested-Information  353  Enumerated   V\n  ```\n\n  > #### Warning {: .warning }\n  >\n  > The P flag has been deprecated by RFC 6733.\n\n- **`@custom_types Mod`{: #custom_types }** - Specifies AVPs for which module\n  Mod provides encode/decode functions. The section contents consists of AVP\n  names. For each such name, `Mod:Name(encode|decode, Type, Data, Opts)` is\n  expected to provide encode/decode for values of the AVP, where Name is the\n  name of the AVP, Type is it's type as declared in the `@avp_types` section of\n  the dictionary, Data is the value to encode/decode, and Opts is a term that is\n  passed through encode/decode.\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```text\n  @custom_types rfc4005_avps\n\n  Framed-IP-Address\n  ```\n\n- **`@codecs Mod`{: #codecs }** - Like `@custom_types` but requires the\n  specified module to export `Mod:Type(encode|decode, Name, Data, Opts)` rather\n  than `Mod:Name(encode|decode, Type, Data, Opts)`.\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```text\n  @codecs rfc4005_avps\n\n  Framed-IP-Address\n  ```\n\n- **`@messages`{: #messages }** - Defines the messages of the application. The\n  section content consists of definitions of the form specified in section 3.2\n  of RFC 6733, \"Command Code Format Specification\".\n\n  ```text\n  @messages\n\n  RTR ::=  \n           \n          { Auth-Application-Id }\n          { Auth-Session-State }\n          { Origin-Host }\n          { Origin-Realm }\n          { Destination-Host }\n          { SIP-Deregistration-Reason }\n          [ Destination-Realm ]\n          [ User-Name ]\n        * [ SIP-AOR ]\n        * [ Proxy-Info ]\n        * [ Route-Record ]\n        * [ AVP ]\n\n  RTA ::=  \n           \n          { Auth-Application-Id }\n          { Result-Code }\n          { Auth-Session-State }\n          { Origin-Host }\n          { Origin-Realm }\n          [ Authorization-Lifetime ]\n          [ Auth-Grace-Period ]\n          [ Redirect-Host ]\n          [ Redirect-Host-Usage ]\n          [ Redirect-Max-Cache-Time ]\n        * [ Proxy-Info ]\n        * [ Route-Record ]\n        * [ AVP ]\n  ```\n\n- **`@grouped`** - Defines the contents of the AVPs of the\n  application having type Grouped. The section content consists of definitions\n  of the form specified in section 4.4 of RFC 6733, \"Grouped AVP Values\".\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```text\n  @grouped\n\n  SIP-Deregistration-Reason ::=  \n                                { SIP-Reason-Code }\n                                [ SIP-Reason-Info ]\n                              * [ AVP ]\n  ```\n\n  Specifying a Vendor-Id in the definition of a grouped AVP is equivalent to\n  specifying it with `@avp_vendor_id`.\n\n- **`@enum Name`{: #enum }** - Defines values of AVP Name having type\n  Enumerated. Section content consists of names and corresponding integer\n  values. Integer values can be prefixed with 0x to be interpreted as\n  hexadecimal.\n\n  Note that the AVP in question can be defined in an inherited dictionary in\n  order to introduce additional values to an enumeration otherwise defined in\n  another dictionary.\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```text\n  @enum SIP-Reason-Code\n\n  PERMANENT_TERMINATION    0\n  NEW_SIP_SERVER_ASSIGNED  1\n  SIP_SERVER_CHANGE        2\n  REMOVE_SIP_SERVER        3\n  ```\n\n- **`@end`{: #end }** - Causes parsing of the dictionary to terminate: any\n  remaining content is ignored.\n\nComments can be included in a dictionary file using semicolon: characters from a\nsemicolon to end of line are ignored.\n\n[](){: #MESSAGE_RECORDS }","ref":"diameter_dict.html#file-format"},{"type":"extras","title":"MESSAGE RECORDS - diameter_dict","doc":"The hrl generated from a dictionary specification defines records for the\nmessages and grouped AVPs defined in `@messages` and `@grouped` sections.
