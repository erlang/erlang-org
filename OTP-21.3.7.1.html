        release_note: "erl_interface/ei refused to use node names with an alive name (the part of the node name preceding the @ sign) longer than 63 characters and a host name longer than 64 characters. The total amount of characters allowed in a node name (alivename@hostname) was thus limited to 128 characters. These limits applied both to the own node name as well as node names of other nodes. Ordinary Erlang nodes limit the node name length to 256 characters, which meant that you could not communicate with certain Erlang nodes due to their node name used.\n\nerl_interface/ei now allow the total amount of characters in a node name to be up to 256 characters. These characters may be distributed between alive name and host name in whatever way needed. That is, the maximum amount of characters in the alive name may be 254 and the maximum amount of characters in the host name may be 254, but in total the node name must not exceed 256 characters.\n\n"
