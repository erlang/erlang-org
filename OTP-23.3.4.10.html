      OTP-17796:
        release_note: "Responsiveness of processes executing on normal or low priority could suffer due to code purging or literal area removal on systems with a huge amount of processes. This since during these operations all processes on the system were scheduled for execution at once.\n\nThis problem has been fixed by introducing a limit on outstanding purge and copy literal requests in the system. By default this limit is set to twice the amount of schedulers on the system. This will ensure that schedulers will have enough work scheduled to perform these operations as quickly as possible at the same time as other work will be interleaved to a much higher degree. Performance of these operations will however be somewhat degraded due to the overhead of enforcing this limit compared to when using a very large limit.\n\nThis limit can be set by passing the +zosrl command line argument to erl, or by calling erlang:system_flag(outstanding_system_requests_limit, NewLimit).\n\n"
