        release_note: "An unintentional reuse of an already used emulator internal event object could cause a wakeup signal to a thread to be lost. In worst case this could cause the runtime system to hang. This hang was however quite rare.\n\n"

        release_note: "NIF threads and driver threads on non-Linux systems leaked internal resources when terminating. On Windows these resources were one event per thread. On most other systems one mutex and one condition variable per thread. On these other systems that also lacked pthread_cond_timedwait() also a pipe with its file descriptors was leaked.\n\n"
