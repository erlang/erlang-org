Such loss of exit signals was very rare. Besides the above described connection loss also the following conditions had to be satisfied:\n\n-- The spawn request that was interrupted by the connection loss also had to set up a link between the parent process and the child process.\n\n-- The parent process that issued the spawn request also had to be terminating while the spawn request was interrupted by the connection loss.\n\n-- The same parent process also had to have made other spawn requests to other nodes than to the node to which the connection was lost.\n\n-- These spawn requests to the other nodes also had to set up links.\n\n-- These spawn requests to the other nodes also had to be not yet completed at the time of the connection loss. That is, the spawn reply from the child process had not yet reached the parent process.\n\nIf all the conditions above were met, exit signals to the children spawned due to the above described spawn requests to other nodes *could* be lost.\n\nThe above bug also caused a significant memory leak when it was triggered since the destruction of the parent process never completed.\n\n"

This exit signal would most often be ignored by the receiver, but if the receiver of the exit signal concurrently set up a new link, it could receive the exit signal with the actual exit reason of the terminating process instead of a noproc exit reason. It is however very hard to detect that this has happened and has no obvious negative consequences, so it should be considered harmless.\n\nA distributed unlink-ack signal received by a terminating process was also not properly removed which could cause a minor memory leak.\n\n"
