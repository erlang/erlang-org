<p>The SNMP agent system consists of one Master Agent and optional Sub-agents.</p><p>The tool makes it easy to dynamically extend an SNMP agent in run-time. MIBs can
be loaded and unloaded at any time. It is also easy to change the implementation
of an MIB in run-time, without having to recompile the MIB. The MIB
implementation is clearly separated from the agent.</p><p>To facilitate incremental MIB implementation, the tool can generate a prototype
implementation for a whole MIB, or parts thereof. This allows different MIBs and
management applications to be developed at the same time.</p><h2 id="features" class="section-heading"><a href="#features" class="hover-link"><i class="ri-link-m" aria-hidden="true"></i></a><span class="text">Features</span></h2><p>To implement an agent, the programmer writes instrumentation functions for the
variables and the tables in the MIBs that the agent is going to support. A
running prototype which handles <code class="inline">set</code>, <code class="inline">get</code>, and <code class="inline">get-next</code> can be created
without any programming.</p><p>The toolkit provides the following:</p><ul><li>multi-lingual multi-threaded extensible SNMP agent</li><li>easy writing of instrumentation functions with a high-level programming
language</li><li>basic fault handling such as automatic type checking</li><li>access control</li><li>authentication</li><li>privacy through encryption</li><li>loading and unloading of MIBs in run-time</li><li>the ability to change instrumentation functions without recompiling the MIB</li><li>rapid prototyping environment where the MIB compiler can use generic
instrumentation functions, which later can be refined by the programmer</li><li>a simple and extensible model for transaction handling and consistency
checking of set-requests</li><li>support of the sub-agent concept via distributed Erlang</li><li>a mechanism for sending notifications (traps and informs)</li><li>support for implementing SNMP tables in the Mnesia DBMS.</li></ul><h2 id="snmpv1-snmpv2-and-snmpv3" class="section-heading"><a href="#snmpv1-snmpv2-and-snmpv3" class="hover-link"><i class="ri-link-m" aria-hidden="true"></i></a><span class="text">SNMPv1, SNMPv2 and SNMPv3</span></h2><p><a href="" id="versions"></a></p><p>The SNMP development toolkit works with all three versions of Standard Internet
Management Framework; SNMPv1, SNMPv2 and SNMPv3. They all share the same basic
structure and components. And they follow the same architecture.</p><p>The versions are defined in following RFCs</p><ul><li>SNMPv1 RFC 1555, 1157 1212, 1213 and 1215</li><li>SNMPv2 RFC 1902 - 1907</li><li>SNMPv3 RFC 2570 - 2575</li></ul><p>Over time, as the Framework has evolved from SNMPv1 , through SNMPv2, to SNMPv3
the definitions of each of these architectural components have become richer and
more clearly defined, but the fundamental architecture has remained consistent.</p><p>The main features of SNMPv2 compared to SNMPv1 are:</p><ul><li>The <code class="inline">get-bulk</code> operation for transferring large amounts of data.</li><li>Enhanced error codes.</li><li>A more precise language for MIB specification</li></ul><p>The standard documents that define SNMPv2 are incomplete, in the sense that they
do not specify how an SNMPv2 message looks like. The message format and security
issues are left to a special Administrative Framework. One such framework is the
Community-based SNMPv2 Framework (SNMPv2c), which uses the same message format
and framework as SNMPv1. Other experimental frameworks as exist, e.g. SNMPv2u
and SNMPv2*.</p><p>The SNMPv3 specifications take a modular approach to SNMP. All modules are
separated from each other, and can be extended or replaced individually.
Examples of modules are Message definition, Security and Access Control. The
main features of SNMPv3 are:</p><ul><li>Encryption and authentication is added.</li><li>MIBs for agent configuration are defined.</li></ul><p>All these specifications are commonly referred to as &quot;SNMPv3&quot;, but it is
actually only the Message module, which defines a new message format, and
Security module, which takes care of encryption and authentication, that cannot
be used with SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c. In this version of the agent toolkit, all the
standard MIBs for agent configuration are used. This includes MIBs for
definition of management targets for notifications. These MIBs are used
regardless of which SNMP version the agent is configured to use.</p><p>The extensible agent in this toolkit understands the SNMPv1, SNMPv2c and SNMPv3.
Recall that SNMP consists of two separate parts, the MIB definition language
(SMI), and the protocol. On the protocol level, the agent can be configured to
speak v1, v2c, v3 or any combination of them at the same time, i.e. a v1 request
gets an v1 reply, a v2c request gets a v2c reply, and a v3 request gets a v3
reply. On the MIB level, the MIB compiler can compile both SMIv1 and SMIv2 MIBs.
Once compiled, any of the formats can be loaded into the agent, regardless of
which protocol version the agent is configured to use. This means that the agent
translates from v2 notifications to v1 traps, and vice versa. For example, v2
MIBs can be loaded into an agent that speaks v1 only. The procedures for the
translation between the two protocols are described in RFC 1908 and RFC 2089.</p><p>In order for an implementation to make full use of the enhanced SNMPv2 error
codes, it is essential that the instrumentation functions always return SNMPv2
error codes, in case of error. These are translated into the corresponding
SNMPv1 error codes by the agent, if necessary.</p><section role="note" class="admonition info"><h4 class="admonition-title info">Note</h4><p>The translation from an SMIv1 MIB to an SNMPv2c or SNMPv3 reply is always very
straightforward, but the translation from a v2 MIB to a v1 reply is somewhat
more complicated. There is one data type in SMIv2, called <code class="inline">Counter64</code>, that an
SNMPv1 manager cannot decode correctly. Therefore, an agent may never send a
<code class="inline">Counter64</code> object to an SNMPv1 manager. The common practice in these
situations is to simple ignore any <code class="inline">Counter64</code> objects, when sending a reply
or a trap to an SNMPv1 manager. For example, if an SNMPv1 manager tries to GET
an object of type <code class="inline">Counter64</code>, he will get a <code class="inline">noSuchName</code> error, while an
SNMPv2 manager would get a correct value.</p></section><h2 id="operation" class="section-heading"><a href="#operation" class="hover-link"><i class="ri-link-m" aria-hidden="true"></i></a><span class="text">Operation</span></h2><p>The following steps are needed to get a running agent:</p><ol><li>Write your MIB in SMI in a text file.</li><li>Write the instrumentation functions in Erlang and compile them.</li><li>Put their names in the association file.</li><li>Run the MIB together with the association file through the MIB compiler.</li><li>Configure the application (agent).</li><li>Start the application (agent).</li><li>Load the compiled MIB into the agent.</li></ol><p>The figures in this section illustrate the steps involved in the development of
an SNMP agent.</p><p><a href="" id="image-1"></a></p><p><img src="assets/snmp-um-1-image-1.gif" alt="MIB Compiler Principles" title="MIB Compiler Principles"/></p><p>The compiler parses the SMI file and associates each table or variable with an
instrumentation function (see the figure
<a href="snmp_agent_funct_descr.html#image-1">MIB Compiler Principles</a>). The actual
instrumentation functions are not needed at MIB compile time, only their names.</p><p>The binary output file produced by the compiler is read by the agent at MIB load
time (see the figure <a href="snmp_agent_funct_descr.html#image-2">Starting the Agent</a>).
The instrumentation is ordinary Erlang code which is loaded explicitly or
automatically the first time it is called.</p><p><a href="" id="image-2"></a></p><p><img src="assets/snmp-um-1-image-2.gif" alt="Starting the Agent" title="Starting the Agent"/></p><p>The SNMP agent system consists of one Master Agent and optional sub-agents. The
Master Agent can be seen as a special kind of sub-agent. It implements the core
agent functionality, UDP packet processing, type checking, access control, trap
distribution, and so on. From a user perspective, it is used as an ordinary
sub-agent.</p><p>Sub-agents are only needed if your application requires special support for
distribution from the SNMP toolkit. A sub-agent can also be used if the
application requires a more complex set transaction scheme than is found in the
master agent.</p><p>The following illustration shows how a system can look in runtime.</p><p><a href="" id="snmp_ch2_fig3"></a></p><p><img src="assets/snmp-um-1-image-3.gif" alt="Architecture" title="Architecture"/></p><p>A typical operation could include the following steps:</p><ol><li>The Manager sends a request to the Agent.</li><li>The Master Agent decodes the incoming UDP packet.</li><li>The Master Agent determines which items in the request that should be
processed here and which items should be forwarded to its subagent.</li><li>Step 3 is repeated by all subagents.</li><li>Each sub-agent calls the instrumentation for its loaded MIBs.</li><li>The results of calling the instrumentation are propagated back to the Master
Agent.</li><li>The answer to the request is encoded to a UDP Protocol Data Unit (PDU).</li></ol><p>The sequence of steps shown is probably more complex than normal, but it
illustrates the amount of functionality which is available. The following points
should be noted:</p><ul><li>An agent can have many MIBs loaded at the same time.</li><li>Sub-agents can also have sub-agents. Each sub-agent can have an arbitrary
number of child sub-agents registered, forming a hierarchy.</li><li>One MIB can communicate with many applications.</li><li>Instrumentation can use Distributed Erlang to communicate with an application.</li></ul><p>Most applications only need the Master Agent because an agent can have multiple
MIBs loaded at the same time.</p><h2 id="sub-agents-and-mib-loading" class="section-heading"><a href="#sub-agents-and-mib-loading" class="hover-link"><i class="ri-link-m" aria-hidden="true"></i></a><span class="text">Sub-agents and MIB Loading</span></h2><p><a href="" id="sub_agent_mib_loading"></a></p><p>Since applications tend to be transient (they are dynamically loaded and
unloaded), the management of these applications must be dynamic as well. For
example, if we have an equipment MIB for a rack and different MIBs for boards,
which can be installed in the rack, the MIB for a card should be loaded when the
card is inserted, and unloaded when the card is removed.</p><p>In this agent system, there are two ways to dynamically install management
information. The most common way is to load an MIB into an agent. The other way
is to use a sub-agent, which is controlled by the application and is able to
register and unregister itself. A sub-agent can register itself for managing a
sub-tree (not to be mixed up with <code class="inline">erlang:register</code>). The sub-tree is identified
by an Object Identifier. When a sub-agent is registered, it receives all
requests for this particular sub-tree and it is responsible for answering them.
It should also be noted that a sub-agent can be started and stopped at any time.</p><p>Compared to other SNMP agent packages, there is a significant difference in this
way of using sub-agents. Other packages normally use sub-agents to load and
unload MIBs in run-time. In Erlang, it is easy to load code in run-time and it
is possible to load an MIB into an existing sub-agent. It is not necessary to
create a new process for handling a new MIB.</p><p>Sub-agents are used for the following reasons:</p><ul><li>to provide a more complex set-transaction scheme than master agent</li><li>to avoid unnecessary process communication</li><li>to provide a more lightweight mechanism for loading and unloading MIBs in
run-time</li><li>to provide interaction with other SNMP agent toolkits.</li></ul><p>Refer to the chapter <a href="snmp_advanced_agent.html">Advanced Agent Topics</a> in this
User's Guide for more information about these topics.</p><p>The communication protocol between sub-agents is the normal message passing
which is used in distributed Erlang systems. This implies that sub-agent
communication is very efficient compared to SMUX, DPI, AgentX, and similar
protocols.</p><h2 id="contexts-and-communities" class="section-heading"><a href="#contexts-and-communities" class="hover-link"><i class="ri-link-m" aria-hidden="true"></i></a><span class="text">Contexts and Communities</span></h2><p><a href="" id="context_and_communities"></a></p><p>A context is a collection of management information accessible by an SNMP
entity. An instance of a management object may exist in more than one context.
An SNMP entity potentially has access to many contexts.</p><p>Each managed object can exist in many instances within a SNMP entity. To
identify the instances, specified by an MIB module, a method to distinguish the
actual instance by its 'scope' or context is used. Often the context is a
physical or a logical device. It can include multiple devices, a subset of a
single device or a subset of multiple devices, but the context is always defined
as a subset of a single SNMP entity. To be able to identify a specific item of
management information within an SNMP entity, the context, the object type and
its instance must be used.</p><p>For example, the managed object type <code class="inline">ifDescr</code> from RFC1573, is defined as the
description of a network interface. To identify the description of device-X's
first network interface, four pieces of information are needed: the snmpEngineID
of the SNMP entity which provides access to the management information at
device-X, the <code class="inline">contextName</code> (device-X), the managed object type (<code class="inline">ifDescr</code>), and
the instance (&quot;1&quot;).</p><p>In SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c, the community string in the message was used for (at
least) three different purposes:</p><ul><li>to identify the context</li><li>to provide authentication</li><li>to identify a set of trap targets</li></ul><p>In SNMPv3, each of these usage areas has its own unique mechanism. A context is
identified by the name of the SNMP entity, <code class="inline">contextEngineID</code>, and the name of
the context, <code class="inline">contextName</code>. Each SNMPv3 message contains values for these two
parameters.</p><p>There is a MIB, SNMP-COMMUNITY-MIB, which maps a community string to a
<code class="inline">contextEngineID</code> and <code class="inline">contextName</code>. Thus, each message, an SNMPv1, SNMPv2c or
an SNMPv3 message, always uniquely identifies a context.</p><p>For an agent, the <code class="inline">contextEngineID</code> identified by a received message, is always
equal to the <code class="inline">snmpEngineID</code> of the agent. Otherwise, the message was not
intended for the agent. If the agent is configured with more than one context,
the instrumentation code must be able to figure out for which context the
request was intended. There is a function <a href="snmpa.html#current_context/0"><code class="inline">snmpa:current_context/0</code></a> provided for
this purpose.</p><p>By default, the agent has no knowledge of any other contexts than the default
context, <code class="inline">&quot;&quot;</code>. If it is to support more contexts, these must be explicitly
added, by using an appropriate configuration file
<a href="snmp_agent_config_files.html">Agent Configuration Files</a>.</p><h2 id="management-of-the-agent" class="section-heading"><a href="#management-of-the-agent" class="hover-link"><i class="ri-link-m" aria-hidden="true"></i></a><span class="text">Management of the Agent</span></h2><p><a href="" id="management"></a></p><p>There is a set of standard MIBs, which are used to control and configure an SNMP
agent. All of these MIBs, with the exception of the optional SNMP-PROXY-MIB
(which is only used for proxy agents), are implemented in this agent. Further,
it is configurable which of these MIBs are actually loaded, and thus made
visible to SNMP managers. For example, in a non-secure environment, it might be
a good idea to not make MIBs that define access control visible. Note, the data
the MIBs define is used internally in the agent, even if the MIBs not are
loaded. This chapter describes these standard MIBs, and some aspects of their
implementation.</p><p>Any SNMP agent must implement the <code class="inline">system</code> group and the <code class="inline">snmp</code> group, defined
in MIB-II. The definitions of these groups have changed from SNMPv1 to SNMPv2.
MIBs and implementations for both of these versions are Provided in the
distribution. The MIB file for SNMPv1 is called STANDARD-MIB, and the
corresponding for SNMPv2 is called SNMPv2-MIB. If the agent is configured for
SNMPv1 only, the STANDARD-MIB is loaded by default; otherwise, the SNMPv2-MIB is
loaded by default. It is possible to override this default behavior, by
explicitly loading another version of this MIB, for example, you could choose to
implement the union of all objects in these two MIBs.</p><p>An SNMPv3 agent must implement the SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB and SNMP-MPD-MIB. These
MIBs are loaded by default, if the agent is configured for SNMPv3. These MIBs
can be loaded for other versions as well.</p><p>There are five other standard MIBs, which also may be loaded into the agent.
These MIBs are:</p><ul><li>SNMP-TARGET-MIB and SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB, which defines managed objects for
configuration of management targets, i.e. receivers of notifications (traps
and informs). These MIBs can be used with any SNMP version.</li><li>SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB, which defined managed objects for access control.
This MIB can be used with any SNMP version.</li><li>SNMP-COMMUNITY-MIB, which defines managed objects for coexistence of SNMPv1
and SNMPv2c with SNMPv3. This MIB is only useful if SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c is used,
possibly in combination with SNMPv3.</li><li>SNMP-USER-BASED-SM-MIB, which defines managed objects for authentication and
privacy. This MIB is only useful with SNMPv3.</li></ul><p>All of these MIBs should be loaded into the Master Agent. Once loaded, these
MIBs are always available in all contexts.</p><p>The ASN.1 code, the Erlang source code, and the generated <code class="inline">.hrl</code> files for them
are provided in the distribution and are placed in the directories <code class="inline">mibs</code>,
<code class="inline">src</code>, and <code class="inline">include</code>, respectively, in the <code class="inline">snmp</code> application.</p><p>The <code class="inline">.hrl</code> files are generated with <a href="snmpc.html#mib_to_hrl/1"><code class="inline">snmpc:mib_to_hrl/1</code></a>. Include these files in
your code as in the following example:</p><pre><code class="makeup erlang" translate="no"><span class="p">-</span><span class="na">include_lib</span><span class="p" data-group-id="8698066345-1">(</span><span class="s">&quot;snmp/include/SNMPv2-MIB.hrl&quot;</span><span class="p" data-group-id="8698066345-1">)</span><span class="p">.</span></code></pre><p>The initial values for the managed objects defined in these tables, are read at
start-up from a set of configuration files. These are described in
<a href="snmp_config.html">Configuration Files</a>.</p><h3 id="standard-mib-and-snmpv2-mib" class="section-heading"><a href="#standard-mib-and-snmpv2-mib" class="hover-link"><i class="ri-link-m" aria-hidden="true"></i></a><span class="text">STANDARD-MIB and SNMPv2-MIB</span></h3><p>These MIBs contain the <code class="inline">snmp-</code> and <code class="inline">system</code> groups from MIB-II which is defined
in RFC1213 (STANDARD-MIB) or RFC1907 (SNMPv2-MIB). They are implemented in the
<code class="inline">snmp_standard_mib</code> module. The <code class="inline">snmp</code> counters all reside in volatile memory
and the <code class="inline">system</code> and <code class="inline">snmpEnableAuthenTraps</code> variables in persistent memory,
using the SNMP built-in database (refer to the Reference Manual, section <code class="inline">snmp</code>,
module <code class="inline">snmpa_local_db</code> for more details).</p><p>If another implementation of any of these variables is needed, e.g. to store the
persistent variables in a Mnesia database, an own implementation of the
variables must be made. That MIB will be compiled and loaded instead of the
default MIB. The new compiled MIB must have the same name as the original MIB
(i.e. STANDARD-MIB or SNMPv2-MIB), and be located in the SNMP configuration
directory (see <a href="snmp_config.html">Configuration Files</a>.)</p><p>One of these MIBs is always loaded. If only SNMPv1 is used, STANDARD-MIB is
loaded, otherwise SNMPv2-MIB is loaded.</p><h4>Data Types</h4><p>There are some new data types in SNMPv2 that are useful in SNMPv1 as well. In
the STANDARD-MIB, three data types are defined, <code class="inline">RowStatus</code>, <code class="inline">TruthValue</code> and
<code class="inline">DateAndTime</code>. These data types are originally defined as textual conventions in
SNMPv2-TC (RFC1903).</p><h3 id="snmp-framework-mib-and-snmp-mpd-mib" class="section-heading"><a href="#snmp-framework-mib-and-snmp-mpd-mib" class="hover-link"><i class="ri-link-m" aria-hidden="true"></i></a><span class="text">SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB and SNMP-MPD-MIB</span></h3><p>The SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB and SNMP-MPD-MIB define additional read-only managed
objects, which is used in the generic SNMP framework defined in RFC2271 and the
generic message processing and dispatching module defined in RFC2272. They are
generic in the sense that they are not tied to any specific SNMP version.</p><p>The objects in these MIBs are implemented in the modules <code class="inline">snmp_framework_mib</code>
and <code class="inline">snmp_standard_mib</code>, respectively. All objects reside in volatile memory,
and the configuration files are always reread at start-up.</p><p>If SNMPv3 is used, these MIBs are loaded by default.</p><h3 id="snmp-target-mib-and-snmp-notification-mib" class="section-heading"><a href="#snmp-target-mib-and-snmp-notification-mib" class="hover-link"><i class="ri-link-m" aria-hidden="true"></i></a><span class="text">SNMP-TARGET-MIB and SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB</span></h3><p>The SNMP-TARGET-MIB and SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB define managed objects for
configuration of notification receivers. They are described in detail in
RFC2273. Only a brief description is given here.</p><p>All tables in these MIBs have a column of type <code class="inline">StorageType</code>. The value of this
column specifies how each row is stored, and what happens in case of a restart
of the agent. The implementation supports the values <code class="inline">volatile</code> and
<code class="inline">nonVolatile</code>. When the tables are initially filled with data from the
configuration files, these rows will automatically have storage type
<code class="inline">nonVolatile</code>. Should the agent restart, all <code class="inline">nonVolatile</code> rows survive the
restart, while the <code class="inline">volatile</code> rows are lost. The configuration files are not
read at restart, by default.</p><p>These MIBs are not loaded by default.</p><h4>snmpNotifyTable</h4><p>An entry in the <code class="inline">snmpNotifyTable</code> selects a set of management targets, which
should receive notifications, as well as the type (trap or inform) of
notification that should be sent to each selected management target. When an
application sends a notification using the function <code class="inline">send_notification/5</code> or the
function <code class="inline">send_trap</code> the parameter <code class="inline">NotifyName</code>, specified in the call, is used
as an index in the table. The notification is sent to the management targets
selected by that entry.</p><h4>snmpTargetAddrTable</h4><p>An entry in the <code class="inline">snmpTargetAddrTable</code> defines transport parameters (such as IP
address and UDP port) for each management target. Each row in the
<code class="inline">snmpNotifyTable</code> refers to potentially many rows in the <code class="inline">snmpTargetAddrTable</code>.
Each row in the <code class="inline">snmpTargetAddrTable</code> refers to an entry in the
<code class="inline">snmpTargetParamsTable</code>.</p><h4>snmpTargetParamsTable</h4><p>An entry in the <code class="inline">snmpTargetParamsTable</code> defines which SNMP version to use, and

identified by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER. A mask is associated with each sub-tree.</p><p>For each possible MIB object instance, the instance belongs to a sub-tree if:</p><ul><li>the OBJECT IDENTIFIER name of that MIB object instance comprises at least as
many sub-identifiers as does the sub-tree, and</li><li>each sub-identifier in the name of that MIB object instance matches the
corresponding sub-identifier of the sub-tree whenever the corresponding bit of
the associated mask is 1 (0 is a wild card that matches anything).</li></ul><p>Membership of an object instance in an MIB view is determined by the following
algorithm:</p><ul><li>If an MIB object instance does not belong to any of the relevant sub-trees,
then the instance is not in the MIB view.</li><li>If an MIB object instance belongs to exactly one sub-tree, then the instance
is included in, or excluded from, the relevant MIB view according to the type
of that entry.</li><li>If an MIB object instance belongs to more than one sub-tree, then the sub-tree
which comprises the greatest number of sub-identifiers, and is the
lexicographically greatest, is used.</li></ul><section role="note" class="admonition info"><h4 class="admonition-title info">Note</h4><p>If the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is longer than an OBJECT IDENTIFIER of an object type

agent should send information about the delivery of inform requests.</p><p>If the <code class="inline">send_notification/5</code> function is used, an <code class="inline">NotifyName</code> must be provided.
This parameter is used as an index in the <code class="inline">snmpNotifyTable</code>, and the management
targets defined by that single entry is used.</p><p>The <code class="inline">send_notification/6</code> function is the most general version of the function.
A <code class="inline">ContextName</code> must be specified, from which the notification will be sent. If
this parameter is not specified, the default context (<code class="inline">&quot;&quot;</code>) is used.</p><p>The function <code class="inline">send_trap</code> is kept for backwards compatibility and should not be
used in new code. Applications that use this function will continue to work. The
<code class="inline">snmpNotifyName</code> is used as the community string by the agent when a
notification is sent.</p><h3 id="notification-sending" class="section-heading"><a href="#notification-sending" class="hover-link"><i class="ri-link-m" aria-hidden="true"></i></a><span class="text">Notification Sending</span></h3><p>The simplest way to send a notification is to call the function
<code class="inline">snmpa:send_notification(Agent, Notification, no_receiver)</code>. In this case, the
agent performs a get-operation to retrieve the object values that are defined in
the notification specification (with the TRAP-TYPE or NOTIFICATION-TYPE macros).
The notification is sent to all managers defined in the target and notify
tables, either unacknowledged as traps, or acknowledged as inform requests.</p><p>If the caller of the function wants to know whether or not acknowledgments are
received for a certain notification (provided it is sent as an inform), the
<code class="inline">Receiver</code> parameter can be specified as <code class="inline">{Tag, ProcessName}</code> (refer to the
Reference Manual, section snmp, module <code class="inline">snmp</code> for more details). In this case,
the agent send a message <code class="inline">{snmp_notification, Tag, {got_response, ManagerAddr}}</code>
or <code class="inline">{snmp_notification, Tag, {no_response, ManagerAddr}}</code> for each management
target.</p><p>Sometimes it is not possible to retrieve the values for some of the objects in
the notification specification with a get-operation. However, they are known
when the <code class="inline">send_notification</code> function is called. This is the case if an object
is an element in a table. It is possible to give the values of some objects to
the <code class="inline">send_notification</code> function
<code class="inline">snmpa:send_notification(Agent, Notification, Receiver, Varbinds)</code>. In this
function, <code class="inline">Varbinds</code> is a list of <code class="inline">Varbind</code>, where each <code class="inline">Varbind</code> is one of:</p><ul><li><code class="inline">{Variable, Value}</code>, where <code class="inline">Variable</code> is the symbolic name of a scalar
variable referred to in the notification specification.</li><li><code class="inline">{Column, RowIndex, Value}</code>, where <code class="inline">Column</code> is the symbolic name of a column
variable. <code class="inline">RowIndex</code> is a list of indices for the specified element. If this
is the case, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER sent in the trap is the <code class="inline">RowIndex</code> appended
to the OBJECT IDENTIFIER for the table column. This is the OBJECT IDENTIFIER
which specifies the element.</li><li><code class="inline">{OID, Value}</code>, where <code class="inline">OID</code> is the OBJECT IDENTIFIER for an instance of an
object, scalar variable or column variable.</li></ul><p>For example, to specify that <code class="inline">sysLocation</code> should have the value <code class="inline">&quot;upstairs&quot;</code> in
the notification, we could use one of:</p><ul><li><code class="inline">{sysLocation, &quot;upstairs&quot;}</code> or</li><li><code class="inline">{[1,3,6,1,2,1,1,6,0], &quot;upstairs&quot;}</code></li></ul><p>It is also possible to specify names and values for extra variables that should
be sent in the notification, but were not defined in the notification
specification.</p><p>The notification is sent to all management targets found in the tables. However,
make sure that each manager has access to the variables in the notification. If
a variable is outside a manager's MIB view, this manager will not receive the
notification.</p><section role="note" class="admonition info"><h4 class="admonition-title info">Note</h4><p>By definition, it is not possible to send objects with ACCESS <code class="inline">not-accessible</code>
in notifications. However, historically this is often done and for this reason
we allow it in notification sending. If a variable has ACCESS
<code class="inline">not-accessible</code>, the user must provide a value for the variable in the
<code class="inline">Varbinds</code> list. It is not possible for the agent to perform a get-operation
to retrieve this value.</p></section><h3 id="notification-filters" class="section-heading"><a href="#notification-filters" class="hover-link"><i class="ri-link-m" aria-hidden="true"></i></a><span class="text">Notification Filters</span></h3><p>It is possible to add <em>notification filters</em> to an agent.

called when a notification is to be sent. Their purpose is to allow
modification, suppression or other type of actions.</p><p>A notification filter is a module implementing the <a href="snmpa_notification_filter.html"><code class="inline">snmpa_notification_filter</code></a>
behaviour. A filter is added/deleted using the functions:
<a href="snmpa.html#register_notification_filter/5"><code class="inline">snmpa:register_notification_filter/5</code></a> and
<a href="snmpa.html#unregister_notification_filter/2"><code class="inline">snmpa:unregister_notification_filter/2</code></a>.</p><p>Unless otherwise specified, the order of the registered filters will be the
order in which they are registered.</p><h3 id="sub-agent-path" class="section-heading"><a href="#sub-agent-path" class="hover-link"><i class="ri-link-m" aria-hidden="true"></i></a><span class="text">Sub-agent Path</span></h3><p>If a value for an object is not given to the <code class="inline">send_notification</code> function, the
sub-agent will perform a get-operation to retrieve it. If the object is not
implemented in this sub-agent, its parent agent tries to perform a get-operation
to retrieve it. If the object is not implemented in this agent either, it
forwards the object to its parent, and so on. Eventually the Master Agent is
reached and at this point all unknown object values must be resolved. If some
object is unknown even to the Master Agent, this is regarded as an error and is
reported with a call to <code class="inline">user_err/2</code> of the error report module. No
notifications are sent in this case.</p><p>For a given notification, the variables, which are referred to in the
notification specification, must be implemented by the agent that has the MIB
loaded, or by some parent to this agent. If not, the application must provide
values for the unknown variables. The application must also provide values for
all elements in tables.</p><h2 id="discovery" class="section-heading"><a href="#discovery" class="hover-link"><i class="ri-link-m" aria-hidden="true"></i></a><span class="text">Discovery</span></h2><p>The <em>sender</em> is <em>authoritative</em> for messages containing payload which does <em>not</em>
expect a response (for example SNMPv2-Trap, Response or Report PDU).</p><p>The <em>receiver</em> is <em>authoritative</em> for messages containing payload which expects
a response (for example Get, GetNext, Get-Bulk, Set or Inform PDU).</p><p>The agent can both perform and respond to discovery.</p><p>The agent responds to discovery autonomously, without interaction by the user.</p><p>Initiating discovery towards a manager is done by calling the
<a href="snmpa.html#discovery/6"><code class="inline">snmpa:discovery/6</code></a> function. The <code class="inline">EngineId</code> field of the target (manager) entry in the
<a href="snmp_agent_config_files.html#target_addr">target_addr.conf</a> file has to have the
value <code class="inline">discovery</code>. Note that if the manager does not respond, the <code class="inline">Timeout</code> and
<code class="inline">RetryCount</code> fields decide how long the function will hang before it returns.</p><p>Discovery can only be performed towards one manager at a time.</p>
