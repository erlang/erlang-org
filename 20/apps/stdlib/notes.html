<h3><a name="id60465">1.4 
        STDLIB 3.4.1</a></h3>

    <h4>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h4>
      <ul>

        <li>
          <p>
	    In OTP-20.0, the behavior of c, make, and ct_make was
	    changed so that in some cases the beam files by default
	    would be written to the directory where the source files
	    were found. This is now changed back to the old behavior
	    so beam files are by default written to current
	    directory.</p>

<h3><a name="id60525">1.5 
        STDLIB 3.4</a></h3>

    <h4>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
	    <p>For many releases, it has been legal to override a BIF
	    with a local function having the same name. However,
	    calling a local function with the same name as guard BIF
	    as filter in a list comprehension was not allowed.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-13690</p>
        </li>
        <li>
	    <p> A new (default) pseudo-random number generator
	    algorithm Xoroshiro116+ has been implemented in the
	    <span class="code">rand</span> module. </p>
<p> The old algorithm
	    implementations had a number of flaws so they are all
	    deprecated, but corrected versions of two of them have
	    been added. See the documentation. </p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-14295 Aux Id: PR-1372 </p>
        </li>
        <li>
	    <p> The Erlang shell, <span class="code">qlc:string_to_handle()</span>, and
	    the Debugger (the Evaluator area and Edit variable window
	    of the Bindings area) can parse pids, ports, references,
	    and external funs, as long as they can be created in the
	    running system. </p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-14296</p>
        </li>
        <li>
	    <p>Internal code change: Calls to <span class="code">catch</span> followed
	    by a call to <span class="code">erlang:get_stacktrace/0</span> has been
	    rewritten to use <span class="code">try</span> instead of <span class="code">catch</span> to
	    make the code future-proof.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-14400</p>
        </li>
        <li>
	    <p> The <span class="code">ms_transform</span> module, used by
	    <span class="code">ets:fun2ms/1</span> and <span class="code">dbg:fun2ms/1</span>, evaluates
	    constant arithmetic expressions. This is necessary since
	    the Erlang compiler, which normally evaluates constant
	    expressions, does not recognize the format generated by
	    <span class="code">ms_transform</span>. </p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-14454 Aux Id: ERIERL-29 </p>
        </li>
        <li>
	    <p> The state machine engine <span class="code">gen_statem</span> can now
	    handle generic time-outs (multiple named) as well as

    <h4>Improvements and New Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Improved unicode support for strings. Added normalization
	    functions in the <span class="code">unicode</span> module. Extended the
	    <span class="code">string</span> module API with new functions with improved
	    unicode handling and that works on grapheme clusters. The
	    new functions operates on the <span class="code">unicode:chardata()</span>
	    type, thus they also accept <span class="code">UTF-8 binaries</span> as
	    input. </p>
          <p>
	    The old string API have been marked as obsolete. The
	    return values have been changed for some error cases.</p>

	    <p>Optimized ETS operations by changing table identifier
	    type from integer to reference. The reference enables a
	    more direct mapping to the table with less potential lock
	    contention and makes especially creation and deletion of
	    tables scale much better.</p> <p>The change of the opaque
	    type for the ETS table identifiers may cause failure in

	    type.</p> <div class="note">
<div class="label">Note</div>
<div class="content"><p> <p> The number of tables stored at one
	    Erlang node <strong>used</strong> to be limited. This is no
	    longer the case (except by memory usage). The previous
	    default limit was about 1400 tables and could be
	    increased by setting the environment variable
	    <span class="code">ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES</span> before starting the Erlang
	    runtime system. This hard limit has been removed, but it
	    is currently useful to set the <span class="code">ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES</span>
	    anyway. It should be set to an approximate of the maximum
	    amount of tables used. This since an internal table for
	    named tables is sized using this value. If large amounts
	    of named tables are used and <span class="code">ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES</span>

	    (plus any options passed to c/2). If compilation fails,

	    Upgraded the OTP internal PCRE library from version 8.33

	    of the <span class="bold_code bc-18"><a href="../../man/re.html"><span class="code">re</span></a></span>
	    regular expressions module.</p>
          <p>
	    Besides various bug fixes, the new version allows for

	    The stack size of normal scheduler threads can be set
	    upon system start by passing the <span class="bold_code bc-13"><a href="../../man/erl.html#sched_thread_stack_size"><span class="code">+sss</span></a></span>

	    <p>All tools included in OTP (dialyzer, debugger, cover,

	    previous format. Tools that retrieve the debug
	    information using <span class="code">beam_lib:chunk(Beam,

	    <p>Background: In record fields with a type declaration
	    but without an initializer, the Erlang parser inserted
	    automatically the singleton type <span class="code">'undefined'</span> to
	    the list of declared types, if that value was not present
	    there. That is, the record declaration:</p>
          <p>
	    -record(rec, {f1 :: float(), f2 = 42 :: integer(), f3 ::
	    some_mod:some_typ()}).</p>
	    <p>was translated by the parser to:</p>
          <p>
	    -record(rec, {f1 :: float() | 'undefined', f2 = 42 ::
	    integer(), f3 :: some_mod:some_typ() | 'undefined'}).</p>
	    <p>The rationale for this was that creation of a "dummy"
	    <span class="code">#rec{}</span> record should not result in a warning from
	    dialyzer that, for example, the implicit initialization
	    of the <span class="code">#rec.f1</span> field violates its type
	    declaration.</p>
	    <p>Problems: This seemingly innocent action has some
	    unforeseen consequences.</p>
	    <p>For starters, there is no way for programmers to
	    declare that e.g. only floats make sense for the
	    <span class="code">f1</span> field of <span class="code">#rec{}</span> records when there is no
	    "obvious" default initializer for this field. (This also
	    affects tools like PropEr that use these declarations
	    produced by the Erlang parser to generate random
	    instances of records for testing purposes.)</p>
	    <p>It also means that dialyzer does not warn if e.g. an
	    <span class="code">is_atom/1</span> test or something more exotic like an
	    <span class="code">atom_to_list/1</span> call is performed on the value of
	    the <span class="code">f1</span> field.</p>
	    <p>Similarly, there is no way to extend dialyzer to warn
	    if it finds record constructions where <span class="code">f1</span> is not
	    initialized to some float.</p>
	    <p>Last but not least, it is semantically problematic
	    when the type of the field is an opaque type: creating a
	    union of an opaque and a structured type is very
	    problematic for analysis because it fundamentally breaks
	    the opacity of the term at that point.</p>
	    <p>Change: To solve these problems the parser will not
	    automatically insert the <span class="code">'undefined'</span> value
	    anymore; instead the user has the option to choose the
	    places where this value makes sense (for the field) and
	    where it does not and insert the <span class="code">| 'undefined'</span>
	    there manually.</p>
	    <p>Consequences of this change: This change means that
	    dialyzer will issue a warning for all places where
	    records with uninitialized fields are created and those
	    fields have a declared type that is incompatible with
	    <span class="code">'undefined'</span> (e.g. <span class="code">float()</span>). This warning
	    can be suppressed easily by adding <span class="code">| 'undefined'</span>
	    to the type of this field. This also adds documentation
	    that the user really intends to create records where this
	    field is uninitialized.</p>

	    do not expect but might find it necessary to make minor
	    not backwards compatible changes into OTP-20.0, so its

	    </p> <p> The <span class="code">gen_statem</span> behaviour is intended to
	    replace <span class="code">gen_fsm</span> for new code. It has the same

	    <p>Background: The types of record fields have since R12B
	    been put in a separate form by <span class="code">epp:parse_file()</span>,
	    leaving the record declaration form untyped. The separate
	    form, however, does not follow the syntax of type
	    declarations, and parse transforms inspecting
	    <span class="code">-type()</span> attributes need to know about the special
	    syntax. Since the compiler stores the return value of
	    <span class="code">epp:parse_file()</span> as debug information in the
	    abstract code chunk (<span class="code">"Abst"</span> or
	    <span class="code">abstract_code</span>), tools too need to know about the
	    special syntax, if they inspect <span class="code">-type()</span> attributes
	    in abstract code.</p>
	    <p>Change: No separate type form is created by
	    <span class="code">epp:parse_file()</span>, but the type information is kept
	    in the record fields. This means that all parse
	    transforms and all tools inspecting <span class="code">-record()</span>

	    The version of the PCRE library Used by Erlang's re
	    module is raised to 8.33 from 7.6. This means, among
	    other things, better Unicode and Unicode Character
	    Properties support. New options connected to PCRE 8.33
	    are also added to the re module (ucd, notempty_atstart,
	    no_start_optimize). PCRE has extended the regular
	    expression syntax between 7.6 and 8.33, why this imposes
	    a potential incompatibility. Only very complicated
	    regular expressions may be affected, but if you know you
	    are using obscure features, please test run your regular
	    expressions and verify that their behavior has not

	    A call to either the <span class="code">garbage_collect/1</span> BIF or the
	    <span class="code">check_process_code/2</span> BIF may trigger garbage
	    collection of another processes than the process calling
	    the BIF. The previous implementations performed these
	    kinds of garbage collections without considering the
	    internal state of the process being garbage collected. In
	    order to be able to more easily and more efficiently
	    implement yielding native code, these types of garbage
	    collections have been rewritten. A garbage collection
	    like this is now triggered by an asynchronous request
	    signal, the actual garbage collection is performed by the
	    process being garbage collected itself, and finalized by
	    a reply signal to the process issuing the request. Using
	    this approach processes can disable garbage collection
	    and yield without having to set up the heap in a state
	    that can be garbage collected.</p>

	    The <span class="bold_code bc-13"><a href="../../man/erlang.html#garbage_collect-2"><span class="code">garbage_collect/2</span></a></span>,

	    BIFs have been introduced. Both taking an option list as

	    <span class="code">code:purge/1</span> and <span class="code">code:soft_purge/1</span> have

	    <span class="code">check_process_code</span> requests in order to
	    parallelize work.</p>
          <p>
	    Characteristics impact: A call to the
	    <span class="code">garbage_collect/1</span> BIF or the
	    <span class="code">check_process_code/2</span> BIF will normally take longer
	    time to complete while the system as a whole wont be as
	    much negatively effected by the operation as before. A
	    call to <span class="code">code:purge/1</span> and <span class="code">code:soft_purge/1</span>
	    may complete faster or slower depending on the state of
	    the system while the system as a whole wont be as much

          <p>
	    In order to be able to support elliptic curve cipher
	    suites in SSL/TLS, additions to handle elliptic curve
	    infrastructure has been added to public_key and crypto.</p>
          <p>
	    This also has resulted in a rewrite of the crypto API to

          <p>
	    Impact: Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) offers
	    equivalent security with smaller key sizes than other
	    public key algorithms. Smaller key sizes result in
	    savings for power, memory, bandwidth, and computational
	    cost that make ECC especially attractive for constrained

	    Increased potential concurrency in ETS for

	    table locks has increased from 16 to 64. This makes it
	    four times less likely that two concurrent processes
	    writing to the same table would collide and thereby
	    serialized. The cost is an increased constant memory
	    footprint for tables using write_concurrency. The memory
	    consumption per inserted record is not affected. The
	    increased footprint can be particularly large if
	    <span class="code">write_concurrency</span> is combined with

	    Leave control back to gen_server during supervisor's

          <p>
	    When an attempt to restart a child failed, supervisor
	    would earlier keep the execution flow and try to restart
	    the child over and over again until it either succeeded
	    or the restart frequency limit was reached. If none of
	    these happened, supervisor would hang forever in this
	    loop.</p>
          <p>
	    This commit adds a timer of 0 ms where the control is
	    left back to the gen_server which implements the
	    supervisor. This way any incoming request to the
	    supervisor will be handled - which could help breaking
	    the infinite loop - e.g. shutdown request for the
	    supervisor or for the problematic child.</p>
          <p>
	    This introduces some incompatibilities in stdlib due to
	    new return values from supervisor:</p>
          <ul>
	    <li>restart_child/2 can now return
	    {error,restarting}</li> <li>delete_child/2 can now

	    <p> When an escript ends now all printout to standard
	    output and standard error gets out on the terminal. This
	    bug has been corrected by changing the behaviour of
	    erlang:halt/0,1, which should fix the same problem for
	    other escript-like applications, i.e that data stored in
	    the output port driver buffers got lost when printing on
	    a TTY and exiting through erlang:halt/0,1. </p>
	    <p> The BIF:s erlang:halt/0,1 has gotten improved
	    semantics and there is a new BIF erlang:halt/2 to
	    accomplish something like the old semantics. See the
	    documentation. </p>
	    <p> Now erlang:halt/0 and erlang:halt/1 with an integer
	    argument will close all ports and allow all pending async
	    threads operations to finish before exiting the emulator.
	    Previously erlang:halt/0 and erlang:halt(0) would just
	    wait for pending async threads operations but not close
	    ports. And erlang:halt/1 with a non-zero integer argument
	    would not even wait for pending async threads operations.
	    </p>
	    <p> To roughly the old behaviour, to not wait for ports
	    and async threads operations when you exit the emulator,
	    you use erlang:halt/2 with an integer first argument and
	    an option list containing {flush,false} as the second
	    argument. Note that now is flushing not dependant of the
	    exit code, and you can not only flush async threads
	    operations which we deemed as a strange behaviour anyway.
	    </p>
	    <p>Also, erlang:halt/1,2 has gotten a new feature: If the
	    first argument is the atom 'abort' the emulator is
	    aborted producing a core dump, if the operating system so
	    allows. </p>

          <p>
	    Behaviours may define specs for their callbacks using the

	    Explicitly kill dynamic children in supervisors</p>
          <p>
	    According to the supervisor's documentation: "Important
	    note on simple-one-for-one supervisors: The dynamically
	    created child processes of a simple-one-for-one
	    supervisor are not explicitly killed, regardless of
	    shutdown strategy, but are expected to terminate when the
	    supervisor does (that is, when an exit signal from the
	    parent process is received)."</p>
          <p>
	    All is fine as long as we stop simple_one_for_one
	    supervisor manually. Dynamic children catch the exit
	    signal from the supervisor and leave. But, if this
	    happens when we stop an application, after the top
	    supervisor has stopped, the application master kills all
	    remaining processes associated to this application. So,
	    dynamic children that trap exit signals can be killed
	    during their cleanup (here we mean inside terminate/2).
	    This is unpredictable and highly time-dependent.</p>
          <p>
	    In this commit, supervisor module is patched to
	    explicitly terminate dynamic children accordingly to the
	    shutdown strategy.</p>
          <p>
	    NOTE: Order in which dynamic children are stopped is not
	    defined. In fact, this is "almost" done at the same time.</p>
          <p>
	    Stack errors when dynamic children are stopped</p>
          <p>
	    Because a simple_one_for_one supervisor can have many
	    workers, we stack errors during its shutdown to report
	    only one message for each encountered error type. Instead
	    of reporting the child's pid, we use the number of
	    concerned children. (Thanks to Christopher Faulet)</p>

	    Allow an infinite timeout to shutdown worker processes</p>
          <p>
	    Now, in child specification, the shutdown value can also
	    be set to infinity for worker children. This restriction
	    was removed because this is not always possible to
	    predict the shutdown time for a worker. This is highly
	    application-dependent. Add a warning to docs about
	    workers' shutdown strategy (Thanks to Christopher Faulet)</p>

	    fix supervisors restarting temporary children</p>
          <p>
	    In the current implementation of supervisors, temporary
	    children should never be restarted. However, when a
	    temporary child is restarted as part of a one_for_all or
	    rest_for_one strategy where the failing process is not
	    the temporary child, the supervisor still tries to
	    restart it.</p>
          <p>
	    Because the supervisor doesn't keep some of the MFA
	    information of temporary children, this causes the
	    supervisor to hit its restart limit and crash.</p>
          <p>
	    This patch fixes the behaviour by inserting a clause in
	    terminate_children/2-3 (private function) that will omit
	    temporary children when building a list of killed
	    processes, to avoid having the supervisor trying to
	    restart them again.</p>
          <p>
	    Only supervisors in need of restarting children used the
	    list, so the change should be of no impact for the
	    functions that called terminate_children/2-3 only to kill
	    all children.</p>
          <p>
	    The documentation has been modified to make this
	    behaviour more explicit. (Thanks to Fred Hebert)</p>

          <p>
	    Since the log_mf_h index file might be read by other
	    processes than the error handler (e.g. by the rb tool),
	    this file should be updated atomically. This will avoid
	    hitting the time gap between opening the file in write
	    mode (and thus emptying the file) and the actual update
	    with the new contents. To do this, a temporary file is
	    written, and the file:rename/1 used to replace the real
	    index file.</p>

	    Supervisors should not save child-specs for temporary
	    processes when they terminate as they should not be
	    restarted. Saving the temporary child spec will result in
	    that you can not start a new temporary process with the
	    same child spec as an already terminated temporary
	    process. Since R14B02 you can not restart a temporary
	    temporary process as arguments are no longer saved, it
	    has however always been semantically incorrect to restart
	    a temporary process. Thanks to Filipe David Manana for
	    reporting this and suggesting a solution.</p>

	    Large parts of the <span class="code">ethread</span> library have been
	    rewritten. The <span class="code">ethread</span> library is an Erlang
	    runtime system internal, portable thread library used by
	    the runtime system itself.</p>
          <p>
	    Most notable improvement is a reader optimized rwlock
	    implementation which dramatically improve the performance
	    of read-lock/read-unlock operations on multi processor
	    systems by avoiding ping-ponging of the rwlock cache
	    lines. The reader optimized rwlock implementation is used
	    by miscellaneous rwlocks in the runtime system that are
	    known to be read-locked frequently, and can be enabled on
	    ETS tables by passing the <span class="bold_code bc-13"><a href="../../man/ets.html#new_2_read_concurrency">{read_concurrency, true}</a></span> option upon table creation. See the
	    documentation of <span class="bold_code bc-13"><a href="../../man/ets.html#new-2">ets:new/2</a></span> for more
	    information. The reader optimized rwlock implementation
	    can be fine tuned when starting the runtime system. For
	    more information, see the documentation of the <span class="bold_code bc-13"><a href="../../man/erl.html#+rg">+rg</a></span> command line argument
	    of <span class="code">erl</span>.</p>
          <p>
	    There is also a new implementation of rwlocks that is not
	    optimized for readers. Both implementations interleaves
	    readers and writers during contention as opposed to,
	    e.g., the NPTL (Linux) pthread rwlock implementation
	    which use either a reader or writer preferred strategy.
	    The reader/writer preferred strategy is problematic since
	    it starves threads doing the non-preferred operation.</p>
          <p>
	    The new rwlock implementations in general performs better
	    in ERTS than common pthread implementations. However, in
	    some extremely heavily contended cases this is not the
	    case. Such heavy contention can more or less only appear
	    on ETS tables. This when multiple processes do very large
	    amounts of write locked operations simultaneously on the
	    same table. Such use of ETS is bad regardless of rwlock
	    implementation, will never scale, and is something we
	    strongly advise against.</p>
          <p>
	    The new rwlock implementations depend on atomic
	    operations. If no native atomic implementation is found,
	    a fallback solution will be used. Using the fallback
	    implies a performance degradation. That is, it is more
	    important now than before to build OTP with a native
	    atomic implementation.</p>
          <p>
	    The <span class="code">ethread</span> library contains native atomic
	    implementations for, x86 (32 and 64 bit), powerpc (32
	    bit), sparc V9 (32 and 64 bit), and tilera (32 bit). On
	    other hardware gcc's builtin support for atomic memory
	    access will be used if such exists. If no such support is
	    found, <span class="code">configure</span> will warn about no atomic
	    implementation available.</p>
          <p>
	    The <span class="code">ethread</span> library can now also use the
	    <span class="code">libatomic_ops</span> library for atomic memory accesses.
	    This makes it possible for the Erlang runtime system to
	    utilize optimized native atomic operations on more
	    platforms than before. If <span class="code">configure</span> warns about no
	    atomic implementation available, try using the
	    <span class="code">libatomic_ops</span> library. Use the <span class="bold_code bc-13"><a href="../../installation_guide/INSTALL.html#Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP">--with-libatomic_ops=PATH</a></span>

	    can either use the explicit module name <span class="code">erlang</span> to

	    specific BIF by using the new compiler directive
	    <span class="code">-compile({no_auto_import,[F/A]}).</span>, which makes all
	    calls to the local or imported function without explicit
	    module name pass without warnings or errors.</p> <p>The

	    <p>Support for Unicode is implemented as described in

	    modules. Files can be opened in modes with automatic
	    translation to and from different unicode formats. The
	    module 'unicode' contains functions for conversion
	    between external and internal unicode formats and the re
	    module has support for unicode data. There is also
	    language syntax for specifying string and character data
	    beyond the ISO-latin-1 range.</p>
	    <p>The interactive shell will support input and output of
	    unicode characters when the terminal and operating system
	    supports it.</p>

	    new part of the manual.</p>
	    <p><strong>io module incompatibilities:</strong></p>
	    <p>The io:put_chars, io:get_chars and io:get_line all
	    handle and return unicode data. In the case where
	    binaries can be provided (as to io:put_chars), they shall
	    be encoded in UTF-8. When binaries are returned (as by
	    io:get_line/get_chars when the io_server is set in
	    <strong>binary mode</strong>) the returned data is also
	    <strong>always</strong> encoded as UTF-8. The file module however
	    still returns byte-oriented data, why file:read can be
	    used instead of io:get_chars to read binary data in
	    ISO-latin-1.</p>
	    <p><strong>io_lib module incompatibilities:</strong></p>
	    <p>io_lib:format can, given new format directives (i.e

    <h4>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
	    <p>Bugs have been fixed in <span class="code">qlc</span>:</p> <ul> <li>Setting the <span class="code">lookup_fun</span>
	    option of <span class="code">qlc:table/2</span> to <span class="code">undefined</span> could
	    cause a crash.</li> <li>If a QLC restricted some
	    column of a table in such a way that a traversal using a
	    match specification was possible and the QLC also
	    compared the key column or some indexed column of the the
	    table with a column of some other table, <span class="code">qlc</span>
	    always chose to traverse the table first, never
	    considering lookup join. This has been changed so that
	    lookup join is always preferred; if an initial traversal
	    using the match specification is desired, the query needs
	    to be rewritten introducing an extra QLC with the
	    filter(s) restricting the column.</li> <li>When
	    trying to find candidates for match specifications and
	    lookup, filters using variables from one generator only
	    are ignored unless they are placed immediately after the
	    generator and possibly other filters using variables from
	    the same generator. In particular, filters joining two
	    tables should not be placed between the generator and the
	    filters using the generator only.</li> <li>The
	    call-back function <span class="code">TraverseFun</span> used for
	    implementing QLC tables is allowed to return a term other
	    than a list since STDLIB 1.14 (OTP-5195). However, when
	    the returned term was a fun <span class="code">qlc</span> often tried to
	    call the fun instead of returning it.</li> </ul> <p>A
	    few minor optimizations have been implemented as
	    well.</p>

	    <p>file:write_file/3, file:write/2 and file:read/2 could
	    crash (contrary to documentation) for odd enough file
	    system problems, e.g write to full file system. This bug
	    has now been corrected.</p> <p>In this process the file
	    module has been rewritten to produce better error codes.
	    Posix error codes now originate from the OS file system
	    calls or are generated only for very similar causes (for
	    example 'enomem' is generated if a memory allocation
	    fails, and 'einval' is generated if the file handle in
	    Erlang is a file handle but currently invalid).</p>
	    <p>More Erlang-ish error codes are now generated. For
	    example <span class="code">{error,badarg}</span> is now returned from
	    <span class="code">file:close/1</span> if the argument is not of a file
	    handle type. See file(3).</p> <p>The possibility to write
	    a single byte using <span class="code">file:write/2</span> instead of a list
	    or binary of one byte, contradictory to the
	    documentation, has been removed.</p>

    <h4>Improvements and New Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
	    <p>The behaviour of the internal functions gen:call/3,4
	    has been changed slightly in the rare case that when the
	    caller was linked to the called server, and the server
	    crashed during the call; its exit signal was consumed by
	    the gen:call/3,4 code and converted to an exit exception.
	    This exit signal is no longer consumed.</p>
	    <p>To even notice this change, 1) the calling process has
	    to be linked to the called server.</p>
          <p>
	    2) the call must not be remote by name that is it must be
	    local or remote by pid, local by name or global by name.</p>
          <p>
	    3) the calling process has to have set
	    <span class="code">process_flag(trap_exit, true)</span>.</p>
          <p>
	    4) the server has to crash during the call.</p>
          <p>
	    5) the calling process has to be sensitive to getting
	    previously consumed <span class="code">{'EXIT',Pid,Reason}</span> messages
	    in its message queue.</p>
	    <p>The old behaviour was once the only way for a client
	    to notice if the server died, but has since
	    <span class="code">erlang:monitor(process, {Name,Node})</span> was
	    introduced and used in gen:call been regarded as an
	    undesired behaviour if not a bug.</p>

	    <span class="code">gen_server:call/2,3</span>,
	    <span class="code">gen_fsm:sync_send_event/2,3</span>,

          <p>To help Dialyzer find more bugs, many functions in the
            Kernel and STDLIB applications now only accept arguments
            of the type that is documented.</p>
          <p>For instance, the functions <span class="code">lists:prefix/2</span> and
            <span class="code">lists:suffix/2</span> are documented to only accept lists
            as their arguments, but they actually accepted anything
            and returned <span class="code">false</span>. That has been changed so that
            the functions cause an exception if one or both arguments
            are not lists.</p>
          <p>Also, the <span class="code">string:strip/3</span> function is documented
            to take a character argument that is a character to strip
            from one or both ends of the string. Given a list instead
            of a character, it used to do nothing, but will now cause
            an exception.</p>
          <p>Dialyzer will find most cases where those functions
            are passed arguments of the wrong type.</p>

          <p>A bugfix in QLC: two of the call-back functions used
            for implementing QLC tables, <span class="code">TraverseFun</span> and
            <span class="code">LookupFun</span>, are now allowed to return a term other
            than a list. Such a term is immediately returned as the
            results of the current query, and is useful mostly for
            returning error tuples.</p>

          <p>Simple-one-for-one supervisors now store the pids of

            the compiler will generate code that verifies the record
            type for '<span class="code">R#record.field</span>' operations in guards. Code
            that verifies record types in bodies has already been
            generated since R10B, but in this release there will be a
            '<span class="code">{badrecord,RecordTag}</span>' instead of a
            '<span class="code">badmatch</span>' if the record verification test fails.

          <p>The <span class="code">public</span> option has been removed from
            <span class="code">digraph:new/1</span>. The reason is that several

            using multiple ETS accesses, which is not thread safe.

          <p>The man page for the <span class="code">lists</span> module has been updated
            with description of the new <span class="code">zip</span>, <span class="code">unzip</span>,
            and <span class="code">partition/2</span> functions.</p>

          <p>The top level group leader used to be listed as job #1 in
            the job list in JCL mode. Since there is no shell
            associated with this process that can be connected to, it
            will no longer be listed.</p>

          <p>The possibility to start the Erlang shell in parallel
            with the rest of the system has been reintroduced for
            backwards compatibility. Note that this old behaviour is
            error prone and should not be used unless for some reason
            necessary.</p>

          <p>The <span class="code">shell</span> commands <span class="code">rr/1,2,3</span> now accepts
            wildcards when reading record definitions from BEAM
            files.</p>
