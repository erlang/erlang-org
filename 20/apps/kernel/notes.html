	    behavior, but specific categories can be toggled at will
	    with minimal runtime overhead when disabled. Refer to the
	    documentation on <span class="code">lcnt:rt_mask/1</span> for details.</p>

<h3><a name="id64107">1.6 
        Kernel 5.3</a></h3>

    <h4>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
	    <p>Function <span class="code">inet:ntoa/1</span> has been fixed to return
	    lowercase letters according to RFC 5935 that has been
	    approved after this function was written. Previously
	    uppercase letters were returned so this may be a
	    backwards incompatible change depending on how the
	    returned address string is used.</p>
	    <p>Function <span class="code">inet:parse_address/1</span> has been fixed to
	    accept %-suffixes on scoped addresses. The addresses does
	    not work yet, but gives no parse errors.</p>

          <p>
	    Fix bug where gethostname would incorrectly fail with
	    enametoolong on Linux.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-14310</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Fix bug causing <span class="code">code:is_module_native</span> to falsely
	    return true when <span class="code">local</span> call trace is enabled for
	    the module.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-14390</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>

	    Since Unicode is now allowed in atoms an extra check is
	    needed for node names, which are restricted to Latin-1.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-13805</p>
        </li>
        <li>

	    Own Id: OTP-13831 Aux Id: OTP-13735 </p>
        </li>
        <li>
	    <p><span class="code">file:write_file(Name, Data, [raw])</span> would turn
	    <span class="code">Data</span> into a single binary before writing. This
	    meant it could not take advantage of the <span class="code">writev()</span>
	    system call if it was given a list of binaries and told
	    to write with <span class="code">raw</span> mode.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-13909</p>
        </li>
        <li>
	    <p>The performance of the <span class="code">disk_log</span> has been
	    somewhat improved in some corner cases (big items), and
	    the documentation has been clarified. </p>

	    <span class="code">code:modified_modules/0</span> returns all currently
	    loaded modules that have changed on disk.
	    <span class="code">code:module_status/1</span> returns the status for a
	    module. In the shell and in <span class="code">c</span> module, <span class="code">mm/0</span>
	    is short for <span class="code">code:modified_modules/0</span>, and
	    <span class="code">lm/0</span> reloads all currently loaded modules that
	    have changed on disk.</p>

	    idle of slow. Worse yet, it doesn't even inform anyone

	    {active,0} as an option when the socket is created, the
	    socket transitions to passive ({active, false}) mode and
	    the socket's controlling process receives a message to
	    inform it of the transition. TCP sockets receive
	    {tcp_passive,Socket}, UDP sockets receive
	    {udp_passive,Socket} and SCTP sockets receive
	    {sctp_passive,Socket}. </p>
          <p>
	    The socket's delivered message counter defaults to 0, but
	    it can be set using {active,N} via any gen_tcp, gen_udp,
	    or gen_sctp function that takes socket options as
	    arguments, or via inet:setopts/2. New N values are added
	    to the socket's current counter value, and negative
	    numbers can be used to reduce the counter value.
	    Specifying a number that would cause the socket's counter
	    value to go above 32767 causes an einval error. If a
	    negative number is specified such that the counter value
	    would become negative, the socket's counter value is set
	    to 0 and the socket transitions to passive mode. If the
	    counter value is already 0 and inet:setopts(Socket,
	    [{active,0}]) is specified, the counter value remains at
	    0 but the appropriate passive mode transition message is
	    generated for the socket.</p>

	    A call to either the <span class="code">garbage_collect/1</span> BIF or the
	    <span class="code">check_process_code/2</span> BIF may trigger garbage
	    collection of another processes than the process calling
	    the BIF. The previous implementations performed these
	    kinds of garbage collections without considering the
	    internal state of the process being garbage collected. In
	    order to be able to more easily and more efficiently
	    implement yielding native code, these types of garbage
	    collections have been rewritten. A garbage collection
	    like this is now triggered by an asynchronous request
	    signal, the actual garbage collection is performed by the
	    process being garbage collected itself, and finalized by
	    a reply signal to the process issuing the request. Using
	    this approach processes can disable garbage collection
	    and yield without having to set up the heap in a state
	    that can be garbage collected.</p>

	    BIFs have been introduced. Both taking an option list as
	    last argument. Using these, one can issue asynchronous
	    requests.</p>
          <p>
	    <span class="code">code:purge/1</span> and <span class="code">code:soft_purge/1</span> have
	    been rewritten to utilize asynchronous
	    <span class="code">check_process_code</span> requests in order to
	    parallelize work.</p>
          <p>
	    Characteristics impact: A call to the
	    <span class="code">garbage_collect/1</span> BIF or the
	    <span class="code">check_process_code/2</span> BIF will normally take longer
	    time to complete while the system as a whole wont be as
	    much negatively effected by the operation as before. A
	    call to <span class="code">code:purge/1</span> and <span class="code">code:soft_purge/1</span>
	    may complete faster or slower depending on the state of
	    the system while the system as a whole wont be as much

	    The Erlang VM now supports Unicode filenames. The feature
	    is turned on by default on systems where Unicode
	    filenames are mandatory (Windows and MacOSX), but can be
	    enabled on other systems with the '+fnu' emulator option.
	    Enabling the Unicode filename feature on systems where it
	    is not default is however considered experimental and not
	    to be used for production. Together with the Unicode file
	    name support, the concept of "raw filenames" is
	    introduced, which means filenames provided without
	    implicit unicode encoding translation. Raw filenames are
	    provided as binaries, not lists. For further information,
	    see stdlib users guide and the chapter about using
	    Unicode in Erlang. Also see the file module manual page.</p>

    <h4>Improvements and New Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
	    <p> The DNS resolver client inet_res has been rewritten,
	    documented and released. See inet_res(3) and Erts User's
	    Guide: Inet configuration. </p>
<p> It can formally not be
	    incompatible with respect to earlier versions since there
	    was no earlier official version. However it was used
	    before and some details have changed. </p>
<p>
	    Configuration now initializes from /etc/resolv.conf and
	    /etc/hosts on all unix platforms regardless of which
	    distribution mode the node is started in. The directory
	    (/etc) these files are supposed to reside in can be
	    changed via an environment variable. These configuration
	    file locations can also be changed in the inet
	    configuration. The files are monitored for change and
	    re-read, which makes a few resolver configuration
	    variables out of application control. The /etc/hosts
	    entries have now their own cache table that is shadowed
	    (with lookup method 'file' is used) by the application
	    configured host entries. This problem (that inet_res
	    configuration only worked for distribution mode long
	    names) was among other reported by Matthew O'Gorman many
	    moons ago. </p>
<p> The lookup methods are still 'native'
	    only per default. Resolver configuration is done on all
	    Unix platforms just to get a usable configuration for
	    direct calls to inet_res. </p>
<p> The functions
	    <span class="code">inet_res:nslookup/3..5</span> and
	    <span class="code">inet_res:nnslookup/4..4</span> are no longer recommended
	    to use, instead use <span class="code">inet_res:lookup/3..5</span> and
	    <span class="code">inet_res:resolve/3..5</span> which provide clearer
	    argument types and the possibility to override options in
	    the call. </p>
<p> Users of previous unsupported versions
	    of inet_res have included internal header files to get to
	    the internal record definitions in order to examine DNS
	    replies. This is still unsupported and there are access
	    functions in inet_dns to use instead. These are
	    documented in inet_res(3). </p>
<p> Bug fix: a compression
	    reference loop would make DNS message decoding loop
	    forever. Problem reported by Florian Weimer. </p>
<p> Bug
	    fix and patch suggestion by Sergei Golovan: configuring
	    IPv6 nameservers did not work. His patch (as he warned)
	    created many UDP sockets; one per nameserver. This has
	    been fixed in the released version. </p>
<p> Improvement:
	    <span class="code">inet_res</span> is now EDNS0 capable. The current
	    implementation is simple and does not probe and cache
	    EDNS info for nameservers, which a fully capable
	    implementation probably should do. EDNS has to be enabled
	    via resolver configuration, and if a nameserver replies
	    that it does not support EDNS, <span class="code">inet_res</span> falls back
	    to a regular DNS query. </p>
<p> Improvement: now
	    <span class="code">inet_res</span> automatically falls back to TCP if it
	    gets a truncated answer from a nameserver. </p>
<p>
	    Warning: some of the ancient and exotic record types
	    handled by <span class="code">inet_res</span> and <span class="code">inet_dns</span> are not
	    supported by current versions of BIND, so they could not
	    be tested after the rewrite, with reasonable effort, e.g
	    MD, MF, NULL, and SPF. The risk for bugs in these
	    particular records is still low since their code is
	    mostly shared with other tested record types. </p>

	    correcting and smoothing algorithms. The timestamp
	    returned by os:timestamp is always consistent with the

          <p>An interface towards the SCTP Socket API Extensions
            has been implemented.It is an Open Source patch courtesy
            of Serge Aleynikov and Leonid Timochouk. The Erlang code
            parts has been adapted by the OTP team, changing the
            Erlang API somewhat.</p>
          <p>The Erlang interface consists of the module
            <span class="code">gen_sctp</span> and an include file
            <span class="code">-include_lib("kernel/include/inet_sctp.hrl").</span> for
            option record definitions. The <span class="code">gen_sctp</span> module is
            documented.</p>
          <p>The delivered Open Source patch, before the OTP team
            rewrites, was written according to
            <span class="bold_code bc-20"><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctpsocket-13">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctpsocket-13</a></span>
            and was claimed to work fine, tested on Linux Fedora Core
            5.0 (kernel 2.6.15-2054 or later) and on Solaris 10 and
            11. The OTP team rewrites used the same standard document
            but might have accidentally broken some functionality. If
            so, it will soon be patched to working state. The tricky
            parts in C and the general design has essentially not
            changed. During the rewrites the code was hand tested on
            SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 10, and briefly on Solaris
            10. Feedbach on code and docs is very much
            appreciated.</p>
          <p>The SCTP interface is in beta state. It has only been
            hand tested and has no automatic test suites in OTP
            meaning everything is most certainly not tested. Socket
            active mode is broken. IPv6 is not tested. The documentation
            has been reworked due to the API changes,
            but has not been proofread after this.</p>
          <p>Thank you from the OTP team to Serge Aleynikov and
            Leonid Timochouk for a valuable contribution. We hope we
            have not messed it up too much.</p>

            of the type that is documented.</p>
          <p>For instance, the functions <span class="code">lists:prefix/2</span> and
            <span class="code">lists:suffix/2</span> are documented to only accept lists
            as their arguments, but they actually accepted anything
            and returned <span class="code">false</span>. That has been changed so that
            the functions cause an exception if one or both arguments
            are not lists.</p>
          <p>Also, the <span class="code">string:strip/3</span> function is documented
            to take a character argument that is a character to strip
            from one or both ends of the string. Given a list instead
            of a character, it used to do nothing, but will now cause
            an exception.</p>
          <p>Dialyzer will find most cases where those functions
            are passed arguments of the wrong type.</p>

          <p>When repairing a disk log with a corrupt index file

          <p>Previously <span class="code">unlink/1</span> and <span class="code">erlang:demonitor/2</span>
            behaved completely asynchronous. This had one undesirable
            effect, though. You could never know when you were
            guaranteed <strong>not</strong> to be affected by a link that you
            had unlinked or a monitor that you had demonitored.</p>
          <p>The new behavior of <span class="code">unlink/1</span> and
            <span class="code">erlang:demonitor/2</span> can be viewed as two operations
            performed atomically. Asynchronously send an unlink
            signal or a demonitor signal, and ignore any future
            results of the link or monitor.</p>
          <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This change can cause some obscure code
            to fail which previously did not. For example, the
            following code might hang:</p>

            %% We were previously guaranteed to get a down message
            %% (since we exited the process ourself), so we could

            <span class="code">port_command/2</span>, <span class="code">port_control/3</span>.</p>
          <p>Documentation for all <span class="code">is_*</span> BIFs (such as
            <span class="code">is_atom/1</span>) has been added.</p>
          <p>Removed the documentation for
            <span class="code">erlang:float_to_binary/2</span> which was removed from
