        release_note: "The emulator got a dynamic library dependency towards libsctp, which on Linux was not intended since the emulator there loads and resolves the needed sctp functions in runtime. This has been fixed and a configure switch --enable-sctp=lib has been added for those who want such a library dependency.\n\n"

        release_note: "The new functions in code that allows loading of many modules at once had a performance problem. While executing a helper function in the erl_prim_loader process, garbage messages were produced. The garbages messages were ignored and ultimately discarded, but there would be a negative impact on performance and memory usage. The number of garbage message depended on both the number of modules to be loaded and the length of the code path.\n\nThe functions affected of this problem were: atomic_load/1, ensure_modules_loaded/1, and prepare_loading/1.\n\n"
