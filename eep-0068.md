EEP 68: JSON library
----

Abstract
========

This EEP proposes introducing a module `json` to the Erlang standard
library with support for encoding and decoding [JSON][1] documents
from and to Erlang data structures. The main reason is to cover
a gap in the Erlang standard library with regards to such a vastly
popular and widespread data format.

Rationale
=========

JSON is commonly used in many different use-cases:

* by web services as a lightweight and human-readable data interchange format;
* as a configuration language in static files;
* as data interchange format by developer tooling;
* and more.

There are many existing JSON libraries for Erlang and other BEAM languages,
however adding such a support to standard library would offer unique benefits.
Most notably being able to use it in situations where leveraging third-party
libraries is complex or cumbersome -- such as stand-alone escripts or
fundamental tooling like a build system, or inside OTP itself.

There have been previous attempts to bring JSON support into OTP, most notably
[EEP 18][EEP], which ultimately weren't adopted previously for various reasons.
However, I believe the time is right to revisit this subject with a fresh
take on an interface such support could take.

JSON is a well defined format specified in parallel in [RFC 8259][RFC] and
[ECMA 404][ECMA], however how this representation should be translated
into Erlang is not fully clear since the data structures don't present
a direct, 1:1 mapping. To help with this, this EEP proposes an interface
that presents both a convenient and "canonical" simple API, as well
as an extensible and highly-customisable API with common underlying
implementation.

This EEP proposes a JSON library which:

* should be easy to adopt in large codebases using one of the popular,
  existing, open-source JSON libraries;
* will allow the existing open-source libraries with custom features
  (like support for Elixir protocols) to become thin wrappers around
  this library;
* will improve, or at least not regress, performance compared to
  leading open-source JSON libraries.

The proposed JSON library will provide:

* JSON encoding, allowing for single-pass encoding of custom data types –-
  in particular, for Elixir, integrating with a protocol through a thin layer
  (implemented outside of OTP);
* JSON decoding with some streaming support allowing to decode messages that
  don't fully fit into memory;
* JSON decoding with support for decoding values split across separate
  messages without fully concatenating them upfront;
* focus on high-performance encoding and decoding;
* full conformance to [RFC 8259][RFC] and [ECMA 404][ECMA] standards,
  the decoder should pass the entire [JSONTestSuite][JSONTestSuite];
* simple API for common use-cases with canonical data type mapping.

Design choices
==============

Data mapping
------------

We propose, in the "canonical" API to map JSON data structues to
Erlang and back in the following way:

| **Decoding from JSON** | **Erlang**           | **Encoding into JSON** |
|------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Number                 | integer() \| float() | Number                 |
| Boolean                | true \| false        | Boolean                |
| Null                   | null                 | Null                   |
| String                 | binary()             | String                 |
|                        | atom()               | String                 |
| Array                  | list()               | Array                  |
| Object                 | #{binary() => _}     | Object                 |
|                        | #{atom() => _}       | Object                 |
|                        | #{integer() => _}    | Object                 |

Erlang has generally a richer value system than JSON, therefore
there's generally more types that can be encoded into JSON,
even if they can never be produced directly by the decoder.

However, with the flexible API, as demonstrated below, the user will
be able to customize the decoding & encoding routines to produce and
consume any Erlang term as necessary in the particular application.

**Note**: A decode-encode rountrip might not produce the same data,
even with custom decoders -- since JSON has such a limited data-type
options, compared to Erlang, some information will be commonly be lost,
for example, coercing all keys in maps to binaries.

Streaming vs value-based parser
-------------------------------

When it comes to data-structure parsers it's common to encounter two
types: ones that given the data produce a complete parsed value,
and others the same data produce a stream of events that can later
be processed to extract values.

The first kind, which we'll call here value-based, is generally simpler,
usually more efficient, and more convenient to use. The second one offers
unique advantages in specific use-cases: for example, where data
can't fully fit into memory.

For the proposed `json` library this EEP suggests a hybrid approach.

First, a simple, value-based API:

```erlang
-type value() ::
    integer() |
    float() |
    boolean() |
    null |
    binary() |
    list(value()) |
    #{binary() => value()}.

-spec decode(binary()) -> value().
```

Error handling is achieved through exceptions. The following errors
are possible:

```erlang
-type error() ::
    unexpected_end |
    {unexpected_sequence, binary()} |
    {invalid_byte, byte()}
```

The exceptions might be enhanced through the [Error Info][ERRINFO] mechanism
with additional meta-data like byte offset where the error occurred.

For the advanced and customizable API, this EEP proposes a callback-based
API that the decoder will use to produce values from the data it parses.

```erlang
-type from_binary_fun() :: fun((binary()) -> dynamic()).
-type array_start_fun() :: fun((Acc :: dynamic()) -> ArrayAcc :: dynamic()).
-type array_push_fun() :: fun((Value :: dynamic(), Acc :: dynamic()) -> NewAcc :: dynamic()).
-type array_finish_fun() :: fun((ArrayAcc :: dynamic(), OldAcc :: dynamic()) -> {dynamic(), Acc :: dynamic()}).
-type object_start_fun() :: fun((Acc :: dynamic()) -> ObjectAcc :: dynamic()).
-type object_push_fun() :: fun((Key :: dynamic(), Value :: dynamic(), Acc :: dynamic()) -> NewAcc :: dynamic()).
-type object_finish_fun() :: fun((ObjectAcc :: dynamic(), OldAcc :: dynamic()) -> {dynamic(), Acc :: dynamic()}).

-type decoders() :: #{
    array_start => array_start_fun(),
    array_push => array_push_fun(),
    array_finish => array_finish_fun(),
    object_start => object_start_fun(),
    object_push => object_push_fun(),
    object_finish => object_finish_fun(),
    float => from_binary_fun(),
    integer => from_binary_fun(),
    string => from_binary_fun(),
    null => term()
}.

-spec decode(binary(), Acc :: dynamic(), decoders()) ->
    {Value :: dynamic(), FinalAcc :: dynamic(), Rest :: binary()}.
```

This allows the user to fully customize the decoded format, including
features seen in open-source JSON libraries:

* decoding string keys as atoms;
* decoding objects as lists of pairs;
* decoding floats as custom structures with decimal precision;
* decoding `null` as another atom, in particular `undefined` or `nil`;
* using `binary:copy/1` on strings that will be retained in memory;
* decoding multiple JSON messages from a single binary blob;
* and more.

Furthermore, this allows the user to only retain parts of the data structure
to achieve results similar to using a streaming SAX-like parser for data
that doesn't fully fit into memory.

The `array_finish` and `object_finish` callbacks are responsible for
restoring the accumulator to continue processing the parent object.
To simplify the case where accumulators are not connected, these
callbacks receive value of the accumulator that was passed to the
corresponding `_start` call.

All the callbacks are optional and have a default value corresponding to the
"simple" API behaviour, using lists as accumulators, in particular:

* for `array_start`: `fun(_) -> [] end`
* for `array_push`: `fun(Elem, Acc) -> [Elem | Acc] end`
* for `array_finish`: `fun(Acc, OldAcc) -> {lists:reverse(Acc), OldAcc} end`
* for `object_start`: `fun(_) -> [] end`
* for `object_push`: `fun(Key, Value, Acc) -> [{Key, Value} | Acc] end`
* for `object_finish`: `fun(Acc, OldAcc) -> {maps:from_list(Acc), OldAcc} end`
* for `float`: `fun erlang:binary_to_float/1`
* for `integer`: `fun erlang:binary_to_integer/1`
* for `string`: `fun (Value) -> Value end`
* for `null`: the atom `null`

Incomplete data parsing
-----------------------

We propose a future enhancement to the full `decode/3` API, where
it can return an `{incomplete, continuation()}` value that can be used to
decode values split across multiple binary blobs (for example as received
from a TCP socket).

```erlang
-spec decode_continue(binary(), continuation()) ->
    {Value :: dynamic(), FinalAcc :: dynamic(), Rest :: binary()} |
    {incomplete, continuation()}.
```

Encoding API
------------

For encoding this EEP again proposes two separate sets of APIs.
A simple API using "canonical" data types:

```erlang
-type encode_value() ::
    integer() |
    float() |
    boolean() |
    null |
    binary() |
    atom() |
    list(encode_value()) |
    #{binary() | atom() | integer() => encode_value()}.

-spec encode(encode_value()) -> iodata().
```

And an advanced, callback-based API allowing for single-pass encoding
of custom data structures. This API is accompanied by a set of functions
facilitating the implementation of custom encoding callbacks.

```erlang
-type encoder() :: fun((dynamic(), encoder()) -> iodata()).

-spec encode(dynamic(), encoder()) -> iodata().

-spec encode_value(dynamic(), encoder()) -> iodata().
-spec encode_atom(atom(), encoder()) -> iodata().
-spec encode_integer(integer()) -> iodata().
-spec encode_float(float()) -> iodata().
-spec encode_list(list(), encoder()) -> iodata().
-spec encode_map(map(), encoder()) -> iodata().
-spec encode_map_checked(map(), encoder()) -> iodata().
-spec encode_key_value_list([{dynamic(), dynamic()}], encoder()) -> iodata().
-spec encode_key_value_list_checked([{dynamic(), dynamic()}], encoder()) -> iodata().
-spec encode_binary(binary()) -> iodata().
-spec encode_binary_escape_all(binary()) -> iodata().
```

The `encoder()` callback is invoked on every value during traversal.
The simple API specified above is equivalent to using the
`fun json:encode_value/2` function as the encoder.

The `*_checked/2` variants of functions offer verifying the encoder
doesn't produce repeated keys.
The default `encode_binary/1` function will emit unescaped unicode values
as allowed by the specifications; however for compatibility reasons
we provide the optional `encode_binary_escape_all/1` function
that will always produce purely ASCII messages encoding all higher
unicode values with the `\u` escape sequences.

Formatting and pretty-printing
------------------------------

This EEP further proposes an additional API for formatting (and pretty-printing)
JSON messages. This API consists of transforming a textual JSON message into
a formatted JSON message.
This is the most flexible solution that orthogonally supports
formatting results of custom encoding functions like described above,
without adding the burden of complex formatting options in the middle of the
encoders.
Formatting isn't usually done in critical hot-paths of high-performance
services, therefore the overhead of a two-pass formatting is deemed acceptable.

```erlang
-type format_option() :: #{
    indent => iodata(),
    line_separator => iodata(),
    after_colon => iodata()
}.
-spec format(iodata()) -> iodata().
-spec format(iodata(), format_option()) -> iodata().
```

Reference Implementation
========================

[PR-8111][PR] Implements the `encode/1`, `encode/2`, `decode/1`, and `decode/3`
functions as proposed in this EEP.
The formatting API and the support for incomplete message decoding is left
as a follow-up task.

Appendix
========

Example of a decoding trace
---------------------------

Given the following data:

```erlang
{"a": [[], {}, true, false, null, {"foo": "baz"}], "b": [1, 2.0, "three"]}
```

the decoding APIs will be called with the following arguments:

```erlang
object_start(Acc0) => Acc1
  string(<<"a">>) => Str1
  array_start(Acc1) => Acc2
    empty_array() => Arr1
    array_push(Acc2, Arr1) => Acc3
    empty_object() => Obj1
    array_push(Obj1, Acc3) => Acc4
    array_push(true, Acc4) => Acc5
    array_push(false, Acc5) => Acc6
    null() => Null
    array_push(Null, Acc6) => Acc7
    object_start(Acc7) => Acc8
      string(<<"foo">>) => Str2
      string(<<"baz">>) => Str3
      object_push(Str2, Str3, Acc8) => Acc9
    object_finish(Acc9) => Obj2
    array_push(Obj2, Acc7) => Acc10
  array_finish(Acc10, Acc1) => {Arr1, Acc11}
  object_push(Arr1, Acc11) => Acc12
  string(<<"b">>) => Str4
  array_start(Acc12) => Acc13
    integer(<<"1">>) => Int1
    array_push(Int1, Acc13) => Acc14
    float(<<"2.0">>) => Float1
    array_push(Float1, Acc14) => Acc15
    string(<<"three">>) => Str5
    array_push(Str5, Acc15) => Acc16
  array_finish(Acc16, Acc12) => {Arr2, Acc17}
  object_push(Str4, Arr2, Acc17) => Acc18
object_finish(Acc18, Acc0) => {Obj3, Acc19}
% final decode/3 return
{Obj3, Acc19, <<"">>}
```

Example of a custom encoder
---------------------------

An example of a custom encoder that would support using a heuristic
to differentiate pairs of object-like key-value lists from plain
lists of values could look as follows:

```erlang
custom_encode(Value) -> json:encode(Value, fun encoder/2).

encoder([{_, _} | _] = Value, Encode) -> json:encode_key_value_list(Value, Encode);
encoder(Other, Encode) -> json:encode_value(Other, Encode).
```

Another encoder that supports using Elixir `nil` as Null and protocols for
further customisation could look as follows:

```erlang
encoder(nil, _Encode) -> <<"null">>;
encoder(null, _Encode) -> <<"\"null\"">>;
encoder(#{__struct__ => _} = Struct, Encode) -> 'Elixir.JSONProtocol':encode(Struct, Encode);
encoder(Other, Encode) -> json:encode_value(Other, Encode).
```
