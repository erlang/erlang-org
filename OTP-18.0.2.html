        release_note: "A process could end up in an inconsistent half exited state in the runtime system without SMP support. This could occur if the processes was traced by a port that it also was linked to, and the port terminated abnormally while handling a trace message for the process.\n\nThis bug has always existed in the runtime system without SMP support, but never in the runtime system with SMP support.\n\n"

      OTP-12895:
        type: " --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---"
        release_note: "*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***\n\nChanged default OS monotonic clock source chosen at build time. This in order to improve performance. The behavior will now on most systems be that (both OS and Erlang) monotonic time stops when the system is suspended.\n\nIf you prefer that monotonic time elapse during suspend of the machine, you can pass the command line argument --enable-prefer-elapsed-monotonic-time-during-suspend to configure when building Erlang/OTP. The configuration stage will try to find such a clock source, but might not be able to find it. Note that there might be a performance penalty associated with such a clock source.\n\n"

      OTP-12892:
        type: " --- Improvements and New Features ---"
        release_note: "The configure command line argument --enable-gettimeofday-as-os-system-time has been added which force usage of gettimeofday() for OS system time. This will improve performance of os:system_time() and os:timestamp() on MacOS X, at the expense of worse accuracy, resolution and precision of Erlang monotonic time, Erlang system time, and OS system time.\n\n"
