        release_note: "Fixed a bug that could cause some work scheduled for execution on scheduler threads to be delayed until other similar work appeared. Beside delaying various cleanup of internal data structures also the following could be delayed:\n\n-- Termination of a distribution controller process\n\n-- Disabling of the distribution on a node\n\n-- Gathering of memory allocator information using the instrument module\n\n-- Enabling, disabling, and gathering of msacc information\n\n-- Delivery of 'CHANGE' messages when time offset is monitored\n\n-- A call to erlang:cancel_timer()\n\n-- A call to erlang:read_timer()\n\n-- A call to erlang:statistics(io | garbage_collection | scheduler_wall_time)\n\n-- A call to ets:all()\n\n-- A call to erlang:memory()\n\n-- A call to erlang:system_info({allocator | allocator_sizes, _})\n\n-- A call to erlang:trace_delivered()\n\nThe bug existed on runtime systems running on all types of hardware except for x86/x86_64.\n\n"
