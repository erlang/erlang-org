It is introduced in order to provide a lightweight mechanism that can prevent late replies after timeout or connection loss. For more information, see EEP 53 and the documentation of the new alias/1 BIF and the new options to the monitor/3 BIF.\n\nThe call operation in the framework used by gen_server, gen_statem, and gen_event has been updated to utilize alias in order to prevent late responses. The gen_statem behavior still use a proxy process in the distributed case, since it has always prevented late replies and aliases wont work against pre OTP 24 nodes. The proxy process can be removed in OTP 26.\n\nThe alias feature also made it possible to introduce new functions similar to the erpc:receive_response() function in the gen behaviors, so the new functions gen_server:receive_response(), gen_statem:receive_response(), gen_event:receive_response() have also been introduced.\n\n"
