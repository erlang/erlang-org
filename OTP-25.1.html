        release_note: "A vulnerability has been discovered and corrected. It is registered as CVE-2022-37026 \"Client Authentication Bypass\". Corrections have been released on the supported tracks with patches 23.3.4.15, 24.3.4.2, and 25.0.2. The vulnerability might also exist in older OTP versions. We recommend that impacted users upgrade to one of these versions or later on the respective tracks. OTP 25.1 would be an even better choice. Impacted are those who are running an ssl/tls/dtls server using the ssl application either directly or indirectly via other applications. For example via inets (httpd), cowboy, etc. Note that the vulnerability only affects servers that request client certification, that is sets the option {verify, verify_peer}.\n\n"
