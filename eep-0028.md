EEP 28: Optional leading semicolons for choices
----

Abstract
========

'If', 'case', 'receive', and 'try' clauses may begin with a semicolon.

Specification
=============

A semicolon is allowed after the keywords 'if', 'of',
'receive' (provided the next word is not 'after'),
and 'catch' (in a 'try' expression).

The semicolon has no effect; it is merely there to allow
a layout style which makes it easier to see the semicolons,
easier to ensure that commas are commas and semicolons are
semicolons, and easier to change the order of choices.

Motivation
==========

In his PhD thesis on compiling Prolog, Peter van Roy complained
that commas and semicolons were hard to distinguish.  In response,
I developed a Prolog layout style where commas go at the end of
lines and semicolons go at the beginner, so that a human being
reading the text is never in doubt about which is intended.

Commas and semicolons remain hard to distinguish in Erlang.
It turns out that a semicolons-at-the-front style works well
for Erlang too.

```erlang
do_load_driver(Path, Driver, DriverFlags) ->
    case erl_ddll:try_load(Path, Driver,
           [{monitor,pending_driver}]++DriverFlags) of
    {error, inconsistent} ->
        {error,bad_driver_name};
    {error, What} ->
        {error,What};
    {ok, already_loaded} ->
        ok;
    {ok,loaded} ->
        ok;
    {ok, pending_driver, Ref} ->
        receive
        {'DOWN', Ref, driver, _, load_cancelled} ->
            {error, load_cancelled};
        {'UP', Ref, driver, _, permanent} ->
            {error, permanent};
        {'DOWN', Ref, driver, _,
                {load_failure, Failure}} ->
            {error, Failure};
        {'UP', Ref, driver, _, loaded} ->
            ok
        end
    end.
```

In this layout style, the visually most salient part is the
beginning of the line, and except for 'case', 'receive', and
'end', _every_ line could be _any_ line.  Indentation alone
is not a reliable guide, because some logical lines have to
be split across multiple physical lines.

My current style is

```erlang
do_load_driver(Path, Driver, DriverFlags) ->
    case erl_ddll:try_load(Path, Driver,
           [{monitor,pending_driver}]++DriverFlags)
     of {error, inconsistent} ->
        {error,bad_driver_name}
      ; {error, What} ->
        {error,What}
      ; {ok, already_loaded} ->
        ok
      ; {ok,loaded} ->
        ok
      ; {ok, pending_driver, Ref} ->
        receive
        {'DOWN', Ref, driver, _, load_cancelled} ->
            {error, load_cancelled}
      ; {'UP', Ref, driver, _, permanent} ->
            {error, permanent}
      ; {'DOWN', Ref, driver, _,
                {load_failure, Failure}} ->
            {error, Failure}
      ; {'UP', Ref, driver, _, loaded} ->
            ok
        end
    end.
```

Here the leading semicolons make it _obvious_ with even half
an eye where each choice begins, and the line of semicolons
(lining up with the 'd' of 'end') makes it easy to see the
structure without a ruler.  There is only one snag:  the
first choice has to be different.  It would be more consistent
to write

```erlang
do_load_driver(Path, Driver, DriverFlags) ->
    case erl_ddll:try_load(Path, Driver,
           [{monitor,pending_driver}]++DriverFlags) of
      ; {error, inconsistent} ->
        {error,bad_driver_name}
      ; {error, What} ->
        {error,What}
      ; {ok, already_loaded} ->
        ok
      ; {ok,loaded} ->
        ok
      ; {ok, pending_driver, Ref} ->
        receive
          ; {'DOWN', Ref, driver, _, load_cancelled} ->
            {error, load_cancelled}
          ; {'UP', Ref, driver, _, permanent} ->
            {error, permanent}
          ; {'DOWN', Ref, driver, _,
                {load_failure, Failure}} ->
            {error, Failure}
          ; {'UP', Ref, driver, _, loaded} ->
            ok
        end
    end.
```

Now each choice has the same structure, and if we wished to
reorder the choices, we could easily do so without adding,
removing, or changing any punctuation.

It is relevant to see what case statements look like in some other
programming languages, to see that this style is quite general.

* Fortran:

        SELECT CASE (expression)
        CASE (values and ranges)
            statements
        CASE (values and ranges)
            statements
        CASE DEFAULT
            statements
        END CASE

* Ada:

        case Expression is
        when Discrete_Choice_List =>
            Statements;
        when Discrete_Choice_List =>
            Statements;
        when others =>
            Statements;
        end case;

* PL/I:

        select (Expression);
          when (Values) Statement;
          when (Values) Statement;
          otherwise     Statement;
        end;

These all exhibit "comb style", the ability to rearrange choices
without adding, removing, or changing punctuation or keywords,
and a clear indication at the _beginning_ of each choice.

Rationale
=========

People who like the usual Erlang style should not be forced to
change.  This means that the leading semicolon must be optional,
not required.

Some of the benefits claimed above could be had by allowing
optional trailing semicolons instead of optional leading ones.
However, in Erlang as it stands, the semicolon is an operator,
not a terminator.  There is nothing unusual about allowing an
operator to have a prefix version as well as an infix version.
There isn't even anything unusual about a prefix operator that
doesn't do much except clarify things: '+' is the obvious
example.  So allowing a "do-nothing" prefix use of semicolons
in certain contexts is still within the spirit of Erlang.

That apart, the change is about as simple as it could be.
The only doubtful point is whether a semicolon should be
allowed before 'after'.  But 'after' is already a keyword
explaining what comes next, and it can't be moved around
freely anyway.  Since there seems to be nothing to gain,
let's not do it.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

All existing Erlang code remains acceptable with unchanged
semantics.  The leading semicolons are dealt with entirely in
the parser; other language manipulation tools never know that
the semicolons were ever there, so work perfectly with code
using the new style.

Reference Implementation
========================

The auxiliary file [eep-0028-1.diff][]
is a patch file to be applied to `erl_parse.yrl`.
The patched file has been checked by yecc, which is happy
with it, and the resulting .erl file compiles cleanly.
However, that's all the testing that has been done.

All that the implementation does is to change

```erlang
.... 'thingy' .....
```

to

```erlang
.... thingy_kw .....

thingy_kw -> 'thingy'.
thingy_kw -> 'thingy' ';'.
```

in several places.  This form of change, rather than

```erlang
.... 'thingy' optional_semicolon ....,
```

was chosen so that the '$n' forms in the existing rules would
need no revision, so I am confident that no errors were
introduced by this change.
