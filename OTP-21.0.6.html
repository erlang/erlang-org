        release_note: "Update the crypto engine functions to handle multiple loads of an engine.\n\nengine_load/3/4 is updated so it doesn't add the engine ID to OpenSSLs internal list of engines which makes it possible to run the engine_load more than once if it doesn't contain global data.\n\nAdded ensure_engine_loaded/2/3 which guarantees that the engine just is loaded once and the following calls just returns a reference to it. This is done by add the ID to the internal OpenSSL list and check if it is already registered when the function is called.\n\nAdded ensure_engine_unloaded/1/2 to unload engines loaded with ensure_engine_loaded.\n\nThen some more utility functions are added.\n\nengine_add/1, adds the engine to OpenSSL internal list\n\nengine_remove/1, remove the engine from OpenSSL internal list\n\nengine_get_id/1, fetch the engines id\n\nengine_get_name/1, fetch the engine name\n\n"
