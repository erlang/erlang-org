        release_note: "The following corrections and improvements are done in the common_test hook handling:\n\n-- An extra argument, Suite, is added as the first argument to each of the following hook callback functions:\n\n-- pre_init_per_group\n\n-- post_init_per_group\n\n-- pre_end_per_group\n\n-- post_end_per_group\n\n-- pre_init_per_testcase\n\n-- post_init_per_testcase\n\n-- pre_end_per_testcase\n\n-- post_end_per_testcase\n\n-- on_tc_fail\n\n-- on_tc_skip\n\nFor backwards compatibility, if the new function is not exported from a hook callback module, common_test will fall back to the old interface and call the function without the Suite argument.\n\n-- If either init_per_suite or end_per_suite exists, but not the other, then the non-existing function will be reported as failed with reason undef in the test log. The same goes for init/end_per_group. This has always been a requirement according to the user's guide, but now common_test is more explicit in the report.\n\n-- If init_per_suite was exported from a test suite, but not end_per_suite, then pre/post_end_per_suite was called with Suite=ct_framework instead of the correct suite name. This is now corrected.\n\n-- If end_per_group was exported from a suite, but not init_per_group, then end_per_group was never called. This is now corrected.\n\n-- Tests that were skipped before calling pre_init_per_* got faulty calls to the corresponding post_init_per_*. E.g. if a test was skipped because suite/0 failed, then post_init_per_suite would be called even though pre_init_per_suite and init_per_suite were not called. This is now corrected so a post_* callback will never be called unless the corresponding pre_* callback has been called first.\n\n-- Tests that were skipped before or in init_per_testcase got faulty calls to pre_end_per_testcase and post_end_per_testcase. This is now corrected so pre/post_end_per_testcase are not called when end_per_testcase is not called.\n\n-- If an exit signal causes the test case process to die while running init_per_testcase, the case was earlier reported as failed with reason {skip,...}. This is now corrected so the case will be marked as skipped.\n\n-- If an exist signal causes the test case process to die while running end_per_testcase, the case was earlier marked as failed. This is now corrected so the status of the test case is not changed - there is only a warning added to the comment field.\n\n-- If a test case was skipped because of option {force_stop,skip_rest} or because of a failed sequence, then no tc_start event would be sent, only tc_done. This is now corrected so both events are sent.\n\n-- When skipping or failing in a configuration function, the configuration function itself would get {auto_skipped,Reason}, {skipped,Reason} or {failed,Reason} in the hook callbacks on_tc_skip or on_tc_fail. The other test cases that were skipped as a result of this would only get Reason in on_tc_skip. This is now corrected so even the configuration function that caused the skip/fail will only get Reason in the hook callback.\n\n"
