EEP 72: Reserved words and Variables as record names, and enhancement to definition syntax
----

Abstract
========

This EEP loosens some of the restrictions around record names to make it no
longer necessary to quote them when they are named with reserved words (`#if`
vs `#'if'`) or words with capitalized first characters (terms that currently
would be treated as variables, for example `#Hello` vs `#'Hello'`).

This EEP also proposes to add a new record-like syntax to the record
definitions (also adopting the above syntactical changes), so that the
following record definitions would be valid and identical:

```erlang
-record('div', {a :: integer(), b :: integer()}).
-record #div{a :: integer(), b :: integer()}.
```

The latter one is proposed new syntax.  The following would also be valid and
identical since parentheses are optional in attributes, and since atoms may be
quoted even when not mandatory:

```erlang
-record 'div', {a :: integer(), b :: integer()}.
-record #'div'{a :: integer(), b :: integer()}.
-record(#'div'{a :: integer(), b :: integer()}).
-record(#div{a :: integer(), b :: integer()}).
```

Usage Syntax Motivation
=======================

Record names are atoms. As such, the current Erlang syntax requires the record
names to be consistent with the rest of the language's use of atoms.

All atoms in Erlang can be denoted with single quotes. Some examples:

For example:

```erlang
'foo'.
'FOO'.
'foo-bar'.
```

But, conveniently, simple atoms (all alphanumeric, underscores (`_`) or
at symbols (`@`) with the first character being a lowercase letter and not one
of the 20+ reserved words), in all contexts can be invoked without the
necessary wrapping quotes. Some examples:

```erlang
foo.
foo_Bar.
'foo-bar'. % still quoted since the term has a non-atomic character in it.
```

Conveniently, this also means that records named with simple atoms can be
invoked and used without having to quote the atoms. For example:

```erlang
-record(foo, {a, b}).
-record(bar, {c}).

go() ->
    X = #foo{a = 1, b = 2},
    Y = X#foo{a = something_else},
    Z = #bar{c = Y#foo.a},
    ...
```

Unfortunately, that also means that records named with anything that doesn't
fit the "simple atom" pattern must be wrapped in quotes in definition and
usage. For example:

```erlang
-record('div', {a, b}).
-record('SET', {c}).

go() ->
    X = #'div'{a = 1, b = 2},
    Y = X#'div'{a = something_else},
    Z = #'SET'{c = Y#'div'.a},
    ...
```

While this approach is consistent with atom usage in the language, for reserved
words and capitalized atoms, this makes the record syntax *feel* inconsistent if you have a need for
naming a record with a reserved word (or term with a capital first letter). In
this case, it almost guarantees a user won't use a record named 'if',
'receive', 'fun', etc even though there may very well be a valid use case for
such a name. The most common use case that comes to mind from the Nitrogen Web
Framework. Since HTML has a `div` tag, Nitrogen (which represents HTML tags
using Erlang records) should naturally have a `#div` record, however, due to
'div' being a reserved word (the integer division operator), the record `#panel`
is used instead to save the programmer from having to invoke `#'div'`,
which feels unnatural and awkward.

Further, applications such as ASN.1 and Corba both have naming conventions that
rely heavily on uppercase record names and as such, they currently must be
quoted as well. You can see this in modules in Erlang's
[`asn1`](https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/OTP-27.1.1/lib/asn1/src/asn1_records.hrl#L35-L39)
application. (The previous link points to some record definitions in `asn1`,
but you can see the usage scattered across a number of modules in the `asn1`
application).

Usage Syntax Specification
==========================

This EEP simplifies the above example by

1. Allowing reserved words and variables to be used without quotes for record
   names, and
2. Simplifying the definition such that the syntax between record definition
   and record usage becomes more consistent.

With the changes from this EEP, the above code becomes:

```erlang
-record('div', {a, b}).
-record('SET', {c}).

go() ->
    X = #div{a = 1, b = 2},
    Y = X#div{a = something_else},
    Z = #SET{c = Y#div.a},
    ...
```

Definition Syntax Motivation
============================

While the updated example in the usage syntax specification makes the *using*
of records cleaner, there remains one more inconsistency that can also be
relatively easily solved. That is the record definition still also needing to
quote record name, as the example above demonstrates (repeated here for
convenience):

```erlang
-record('div', {a, b}).

go() ->
    X = #div{a = 1, b = 2},
    Y = X#div{a = something_else},
    Z = Y#div.a,
    ...
```

So whereas the record definition needs to be thought of as `'div'`, the record
usage no longer requires the quoted term 'div', which could certainly lead an
Erlang beginner to wonder why 'div' needs to be quoted in the definition while
other atom-looking terms don't.

Definition Syntax Specification
===============================

Conveniently, there is a rather easy solution, and that's to
allow the record usage syntax to also be used as the record definition.

This EEP also then also adds a new record definition syntax, improving the
symmetry between general record usage and record definition.

The above example can fully then look like the following:

```erlang
-record #div{a, b}.

go() ->
    X = #div{a = 1, b = 2},
    Y = X#div{a = something_else},
    Z = Y#div.a,
    ...
```

Implementation
==============

To update the syntax for using records, we can safely augment the parser to
change its already existing record handling of `'#' atom '{' ... '}'` and
`'#'atom '.' atom` into `'#' record_name '{' ... '}'` and
`'#' record_name '.' atom`, and define `record_name` to be `atom`, `var`, or
`reserved_word`.

To update the record definition syntax, we can simply add a few new
modifications to the `attribute` Nonterminal to allow `'#' record_name` as name
for the `record` attribute, instead of `atom` as for generic attributes.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

As this EEP only adds new syntax, the vast majority existing codebases will
still work, with the possible exception of AST/code analysis tools that are
analyzing code using the new syntax.

Syntax highlighting and code completion tools may need to be updated to support
the new syntax if your code uses the new syntax rules.

Broader Concerns and Points of Discussion
=========================================

While the new definition syntax creates some degree of symmetry around record
usage, perfect symmetry is impossible to achieve, since a record can always
be handled as the atom tagged tuple it actually is. The question is where
to draw the line where the record's true nature shows, and how hard we
should try to hide it. These are remaining concerns and inconsistencies:

Auxiliary Record Functions
--------------------------

Other functions that work with records like `is_record/2` or `record_info/1`
are not currently covered by any of the syntactical changes in this EEP, and as
such, it remains necessary to quote record names if they are not simple atoms.
For example: `is_record(X, div)` would still be a syntax error. So there is
still not true 100% symmetry.  Note that instead of using the
`is_record(X, 'div')` guard, matching on `#div{}` is probably more frequently
used, since it is terser and mostly regarded as more readable.

Two Definition Syntaxes?
------------------------

This EEP introducing a new syntax for record definition could potentially lead
to some to wonder why the language has two rather different syntaxes for
defining records. Since usage of the syntax for getting, setting, matching, etc
(e.g. `#rec{a=x,y=b}`) occurs far more commonly than defining, it only feels
natural that the definition syntax would mirror usage.

For more symmetry, the syntax in Erlang's type system to define records also
matches the newly proposed define syntax.

Thus, I feel that sharing the existing usage and type syntax with the
definition system would likely become the default/preferred way, and that the
original syntax remain for backwards compatibility.
