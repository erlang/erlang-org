        release_note: "For gen_tcp:connect/3,4 it is possible to specify a specific source port, which should be enough to bind the socket to an address with that port before connecting.\n\nUnfortunately that feature was lost in OTP-17216 that made it mandatory to specify the source address to get an address binding, and ignored a specified source port if no source address was specified.\n\nThat bug has now been corrected.\n\n"
