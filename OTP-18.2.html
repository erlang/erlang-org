        release_note: "Add upper limit for session cache, configurable on ssl application level.\n\nIf upper limit is reached, invalidate the current cache entries, e.i the session lifetime is the max time a session will be keept, but it may be invalidated earlier if the max limit for the table is reached. This will keep the ssl manager process well behaved, not exhusting memeory. Invalidating the entries will incrementally empty the cache to make room for fresh sessions entries.\n\n"
