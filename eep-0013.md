EEP 13: -enum declarations
----

Abstract
========

Erlang programs often need to process data streams using data
formats devised without reference to Erlang.  For this reason
OTP supports ASN.1 and CORBA, amongst other interface techniques.
Binary data streams often contain "symbolic" values that are
represented in the original description by some kind of
enumeration declaration, often literally a C "enum" declaration.

This EEP proposes an "`-enum`" declaration for Erlang for
convenient mapping between atoms on one side of an interface and
integers on the other, especially in the bit syntax.

This replaces some uses of the preprocessor with something that
permits the clearer expression of the programmer's intent.

Specification
=============

A new form of declaration is added, four new guard BIFs, and a
new type specifier for bit syntax.

Declaration
-----------

```erlang
'-' 'enum' '(' identifier-and-size ',' '{' enum-binding
    {',' enum-binding}* ')' '.'
```

where identifier-and-size is

```erlang
identifier
```

or

```erlang
identifier : size
```

or

```erlang
identifier / type-specifier-list
```

or

```erlang
identifier : size / type-specifier-list
```

and enum-binding is

```erlang
identifier '=' constant-integer-expression
```

or

```erlang
identifier
```

size and type-specifier-list are as in the bit syntax,
except that the type-specifier-list may not include a Type.
If the size is missing, it will be the first of [8,16,32,64]
that is compatible with the integer values, as described later.
If the size is present, it must be an integer that is compatible
with the integer values.  Signedness, if present, must agree
with the integer values.

Example
-------

```erlang
-enum(colour, {red,orange,yellow,green,blue}).
-enum(fruit:32,  {quandong,lime,banana,orange,apple}).
```

The identifier following the left parenthesis is called the
"enumeration identifier" and the identifiers bound by the
bindings are called "enumerals".

After `-include` and `-if` processing, there should be at most one
enum declaration for any identifier.  The identifier must not
be one of

```erlang
integer | float | binary | bytes | bitstring | bits
```

Such a declaration only has significance within the constructs
defined in this EEP; the only existing notation which is affected
is the bit syntax.

Within a single enum declaration, an enumeral may not be bound in
two or more bindings.

If the first binding does not have an integer-constant-expression,
it is as if "= 0" appeared.  If a later binding does not have an
integer-constant-expression, it is as if "= N" appeared, where N
is one more than the integer value of the previous binding.

Within a single enum declaration, an integer value may not be used
in two or more bindings, whether implicitly or explicitly.

Built-in functions
------------------

### `is_enum_atom(Atom, Enumeration_Identifier)`

* `true` when Enumeration_Identifier is an atom that is declared
  as an enumeration identifier and Atom is one of the enumerals
  in that declaration,
* `false` otherwise.

May be used as a guard test provided
Enumeration_Identifier is a literal atom,
with a compile-time error if it has no enum declaration.

### `is_enum_integer(Integer, Enumeration_Identifier)`

* `true` when Enumeration_Identifier is an atom that is declared
  as an enumeration identifier and Integer is an integer that
  is used as the value in one of the bindings in that
  declaration,
* `false` otherwise.

May be used as a guard test provided
Enumeration_Identifier is a literal atom,
with a compile-time error if it has no enum declaration.

### `enum_to_atom(Integer, Enumeration_Identifier)`

* when `is_enum_integer(Integer, Enumeration_Identifier)` ->  
  the enumeral bound to Integer in the
  declaration of Enumeration_Identifier

* otherwise exits with `badarg`.

May be used in a guard expression provided
Enumeration_Identifier is a literal atom,
with a compile-time error if it has no enum declaration.

### `enum_to_integer(Atom, Enumeration_Identifier)`

* when `is_enum_atom(Atom, Enumeration_Identifier)` ->  
  the integer value that Atom is bound to in the
  declaration of Enumeration_Identifier

* otherwise exits with `badarg`.

May be used in a guard expression provided
Enumeration_Identifier is a literal atom,
with a compile-time error if it has no enum declaration.

All four of these functions are expected to take O(1) time
and to allocate no storage at run time.

Bit syntax extension
--------------------

The Type in a segment of the bit syntax may additionally be
an Enumeration_Identifier, and the corresponding Value will
then be an atom.  The value in the bit string that is being
matched or constructed is or will be the integer bound to
the atom; as such the Size, Endianness, Signedness, and Unit
are interpreted as for the `integer` Type.

In constructing a bit string,

```erlang
    V / Enumeration_Identifier ...
or  V : Size / Enumeration_Identifier ...
```

acts as if

```erlang
    enum_to_integer(V, Enumeration_Identifier) / integer ...
or  enum_to_integer(V, Enumeration_Identifier) : Size / integer ...
```

had been written, with one exception, which is now described.

If all the integer values in an enum declaration are non-negative,
let k be the smallest integer such that 2^k is greater than all
of them. If some are negative, let k be the smallest integer such
that 2^(k-1) is greater than all of them and -(2^(k-1)) is less
than or equal to all of them. The size of a segment for an
enumeration value must then be at least k bits, whatever the
actual value. A programmer who finds a need to bypass this can
do the enumeral<->integer conversion manually; what this limit
does is to prevent accidental mis-specification. The size given
in the enum declaration must be at least k. If no size is given
in the bit syntax, the size given (or defaulted) in the enum
declaration will be used.

When such a segment is used in pattern matching, it is as if

* first an integer is extracted as if the Type had been `integer`,
* then the value is converted to an atom as if by `enum_to_atom`,
* and finally the atom is matched to whatever pattern appeared.

One expects that cases where the value V is an explicit atom
will be translated completely at compile time, therefore having
no overhead compared with using macros and `/integer`.

Motivation
==========

This was inspired by thinking about PADS and other data
description languages.  Imagine a C program doing something like

```erlang
enum seriousness {
    not_serious = 'N',
    hospitalised = 'H',
    life_threatening = 'L',
    congenital_abnormality = 'C',
    persisting_disability = 'P',
    intervention_required = 'I',
    death = 'D'
};
struct Message {
    char tag;                       /* a seriousness */
    union {
        int   number_of_days;       /* H */
        float extent_of_disability; /* C or P */
        char  procedure_code[5];    /* I */
    } supplement;
};
```

(The Message structure has been considerably simplified.)

Now imagine matching it.

```erlang
-define(NOT_SERIOUS, $N).
-define(HOSPITALISED, $H).
-define(LIFE_THREATENING, $L).
-define(CONGENITAL_ABNORMALITY, $C).
-define(PERSISTING_DISABILITY, $P).
-define(INTERVENTION_REQUIRED, $I).
-define(DEATH, $D).

decode_message(B0) ->
    case B0
      of <<?NOT_SERIOUS, B1/binary>> ->
            {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}not_serious}, B1}
       ; <<?HOSPITALISED, NDays:32, B1/binary>> ->
            {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}hospitalised,NDays}, B1}
       ; <<?LIFE_THREATENING, B1/binary>> ->
            {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}life_threatening}, B1}
       ; <<?CONGENITAL_ABNORMALITY, Extent/float, B1/binary>> ->
            {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}congenital_abnormality,Extent}, B1}
       ; <<?PERSISTING_DISABILITY, Extent/float, B1/binary>> ->
            {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}persisting_abnormality,Extent}, B1}
       ; <<?INTERVENTION_REQUIRED, Code:5/bytes, B1/binary>> ->
            {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}intervention_required,Code}, B1}
       ; <<?DEATH, B1/binary>> ->
            {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}death}, B1}
    end.
```

There are a number of problems with this.

* You have to use macros; functions are not allowed in patterns.
* There is nothing to link these macros together as a group.
* So there is no help checking that you are using the right ones.
* There is no word to relate them back to the original enum.
* If the size isn't 8, it must be repeated in each pattern.
* If the Endianness isn't `big`, it must be repeated in each
  pattern.
* If the size is wrong, too bad.
* If a macro from the wrong list is used, too bad.
* You cannot use the same enumeral name for more than one
  enumeration, unless it happens to have the same value in both.
* If you pass the macros around in a computation, they look
  just like numbers to tracers and debuggers; they have no
  run-time symbolic value.

Now here's the version using `-enum`.

```erlang
-enum(seriousness : 8, {
    not_serious = $N,
    hospitalised = $H
    life_threatening = $L,
    congenital_abnormality = $C,
    persisting_disability = $P,
    intervention_required = $I,
    death = $D
}).

decode_message(B0) ->
    case B0
      of <<not_serious/seriousness,
          B1/binary>> ->
            {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}not_serious}, B1}
       ; <<hospitalised/seriousness,
           NDays:32, B1/binary>> ->
            {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}hospitalised,NDays}, B1}
       ; <<life_threatening/seriousness,
           B1/binary>> ->
            {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}life_threatening}, B1}
       ; <<congenital_abnormality/seriousness,
           Extent/float, B1/binary>> ->
            {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}congenital_abnormality,Extent}, B1}
       ; <<persisting_disability/seriousness,
            Extent/float, B1/binary>> ->
            {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}persisting_abnormality,Extent}, B1}
       ; <<intervention_required/seriousness,
            Code:5/bytes, B1/binary>> ->
            {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}intervention_required,Code}, B1}
       ; <<death/seriousness,
           B1/binary>> ->
            {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}death}, B1}
    end.
```

Rather fortuitously, this feature also provides a way of
accepting any of a set of atoms or integers with a single
guard test.  Let's restructure the previous example to
first extract the seriousness and then match the body, but
this time, have just one body of each shape.

```erlang
-enum(seriousness, {
    not_serious = $N,
    hospitalised = $H
    life_threatening = $L,
    congenital_abnormality = $C,
    persisting_disability = $P,
    intervention_required = $I,
    death = $D
}).
-enum(no_more_info, {
    not_serious = $N,
    life_threatening = $L,
    death = $D
}).
-enum(extent_of_impairment, {
    congenital_abnormality = $C,
    persisting_disability = $P
}).

decode_message(<<Seriousness/seriousness, B0/binary>>) ->
    if is_enum_atom(Seriousness, no_more_info) ->
       {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}Seriousness}, B0}
     ; is_enum_atom(Seriousness, extent_of_impairment) ->
       <<Extent/float, B1/binary>> = B0,
       {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}Seriousness,Extent}, B1}
     ; Seriousness =:= hospitalised ->
       <<NDays:32, B1/binary>> = B0,
       {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}Seriousness,NDays}, B1}
     ; Seriousness =:= intervention_required ->
       <<Code:5/bytes, B1/binary>> = B0,
       {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}Seriousness,Code}, B1}
    end.
```

Rationale
=========

Since this is supposed to make it easy to convert descriptions
from C or PADS or similar forms, an enum declaration looks like
a C enum declaration.

Since size, signedness, and endianness may be needed in multiple
places, it makes sense to put them all in the declaration so that
they don't have to be repeated (and therefore cannot be repeated
incorrectly).

The order of the arguments in the new BIFs is chosen to match
the order of the arguments in `is_record/2`, so as to be familiar
to Erlang programmers.

The new BIFs are needed to explain the extended bit syntax.
The only abbreviation in their names is `enum`, which exactly
matches the keyword in the declaration.

The new BIFs can also be used to implement the extended bit
syntax by source-to-source transformation; no actual change to
the bit syntax machinery is required.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

Code that uses any of the four new BIFs will be affected.
The nearest that the Erlang/OTP sources come to mentioning
any of those atoms is `enum_to_int`, which is used.
Code that does use any of these BIFs can be found using
cross-reference tools.

A simple approach would be to say that the BIFs `is_enum_atom/2`,
`is_enum_integer/2`, `enum_to_atom/2`, `and enum_to_integer/2`
are in scope in a module if and only if there is an `-enum`
declaration in that module, in which case existing code would
be entirely unaffected.

The effect on the bit syntax is that previously illegal
forms (where Type is not one of the existing numeric or bit
string types or Value is an atom) become legal, but only if
licensed by appropriate `-enum` declarations.

Reference Implementation
========================

There is none.  However, we can sketch one.
The four new BIFs are all simple table lookups of the kind that
the Erlang compiler already has to be able to generate for
indexed clause selection.  As such, they are safe to call in
guards.  Since the Type in the bit syntax may only be an
enumeration name when it is a literal atom known to the compiler
as an enumeration name, the constructor

```erlang
<<... V : S / T X ...>>
```

can be translated as

```erlang
( V1 = enum_to_integer(V, X), <<... V1 : S / integer X ...>>)
```

and the pattern

```erlang
<<... V : S / T X ...>>
```

can be translated to

```erlang
<<... V' : S / integer X ...>>
```

by adding

```erlang
V =:= enum_to_atom(V', T)
```

to the guard if V occurs elsewhere in the pattern or will be
bound in the context, or

```erlang
   V = enum_to_atom(V', T)
if V would not otherwise become bound.
```

Binding like this should be allowed in guards anyway,
but in this case it is perfectly safe because it is O(1) and
does not require any dynamic storage allocation (unlike, say,
arithmetic).
