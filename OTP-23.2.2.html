        release_note: "Integers outside of the range [-(1 bsl 32) - 1, (1 bsl 32) -1] were previously intended to be printed in an internal bignum format by ei_print_term() and ei_s_print_term(). Unfortunately the implementation has been buggy since OTP R13B02 and since then produced results with random content which also could crash the calling program.\n\nThis fix replaces the printing of the internal format with printing in hexadecimal form and extend the range for printing in decimal form. Currently integers in the range [-(1 bsl 64), (1 bsl 64)] are printed in decimal form and integers outside of this range in Erlang hexadecimal form.\n\n"
