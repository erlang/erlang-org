        release_note: "Fix getifaddrs realloc pointer error\n\nWhen a buffer was exhausted and subsequently reallocated, we could get an unsafe pointer pointing to faulty memory.\n\nFor this to occur we would need to have a large number of interfaces and a reallocation of memory to a lower addresses.\n\nThe symptom would be garbage returned from erlang:port_control(Port, 25, []) (prim_inet:getifaddrs(Port) resulting in a badarg) or a segmentation fault.\n\n"

        release_note: "Don't close all file descriptors twice in child_setup\n\nThe commit c2b4eab25c907f453a394d382c04cd04e6c06b49 introduced an error in which child_setup erroneously tried to close all file descriptors twice.\n\nUse closefrom() if available when closing all file descriptors.\n\nThe function closefrom() was only used in the vfork() case before but is now also used in the fork() case if available.\n\n"

      OTP-12447:
        type: " --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---"
        release_note: "During a crashdump all file descriptors are closed to ensure the closing of the epmd port and to reserve a file descriptor for the crashdump file.\n\nIf a driver (third party library) cannot handle closing of sockets this could result in a segmentation fault in which case a crashdump would not be produced. This is now fixed by only closing inets sockets via an emergency close callback to the driver and thus closing the epmd socket.\n\n"
