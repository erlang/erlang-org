      OTP-16955:
        type: " --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---"
        release_note: "The inet driver used to use 16 as maximum elements in an I/O vector passed to writev() (and WSASend() on Windows). When the data to send contained lots of elements, this caused a performance degradation since repeated calls to writev() had to be made to a much larger extent. The inet driver now looks up actual maximum amount of elements that can be used on the system, instead of just assuming 16. On most systems this will result in a maximum amount of I/O vector elements of 1024.\n\nAs of OTP 23.0 the term encoding of signals to send over the distribution are encoded into I/O vectors of buffers instead of into a single buffer. Reference counted binaries are referred to directly from the I/O vector instead of being copied into the single buffer. That is, Erlang signals containing huge amounts of reference counted binaries was effected by this performance degradation.\n\n"

        release_note: "In the distributed case, a faulty reply option in a call to the spawn_request() BIF erroneously caused a badarg exception instead of a badopt error message reply.\n\n"
