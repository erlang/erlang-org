        release_note: "Fix request table leaks\n\nThe End-to-End and Hop-by-Hop identifiers of outgoing Diameter requests are stored in a table in order for the caller to be located when the corresponding answer message is received. Entries were orphaned if the handler was terminated by an exit signal as a consequence of actions taken by callback functions, or if callbacks modified identifiers in retransmission cases.\n\n"

        release_note: "Add service_opt() strict_mbit.\n\nThere are differing opinions on whether or not reception of an arbitrary AVP setting the M-bit is an error. The default interpretation is strict: if a command grammar doesn't explicitly allow an AVP setting the M-bit then reception of such an AVP is regarded as an error. Setting {strict_mbit, false} disables this check.\n\n"
