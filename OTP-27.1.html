        release_note: "The [`zip`] module has been updated with support for:\n\n- zip64 archives - Archives larger than 4GB or with more than 2^32 entries.\n- extended timestamps - Higher resolution and in UTC.\n- UID/GID - Save and extract the original UID/GID.\n- Fixes so that permission mode attributes are correctly read and set for\n  files in archives.\n- `zip:list_dir/2` now also returns directories, not only files. (You can\n  disable this behaviour by using the option `skip_directories`).\n\nVarious bugs in the original implementation have also been fixed, such as:\n\n- Correctly encode and decode the DOS timestamps for entries within an archive\n  (that is the non-extended timestamp).\n- Fix DOS timestamps to be set to localtime instead of UTC (use extended\n  timestamps for UTC timestamps).\n- Use the unix file attributes read from disk when creating archives instead\n  of setting everything to 644.\n\n[`zip`]: https://erlang.org/doc/man/zip"
