        release_note: "The nodelay option used to be enabled (true) by default for sockets opened by the Common Test telnet client. This appeared to cause communication problems with telnet servers on some systems, and therefore the option is no longer used. Its value may instead be specified in the telnet connection settings. See the man page for ct_telnet for details. Please note that the interface function connect in unix_telnet has been updated with an extra argument and is now unix_telnet:connect/7.\n\n"
