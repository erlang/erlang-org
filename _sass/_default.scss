/*
  Doing collapse of a non-navbar item turned out to be hard/impossible
  so I had to be a bit creative with CSS here.

  This is copied from .navbar-expand of bootstrap and
  then fixed to only effect the classes .navbar-collapse
  and .navbar-toggler.
  
  You use this class the same way as you would use a navbar
  only that the toplevel class is called collapse-expand-XX.

  So for example say you want to create a card that collapses
  the body at the lg breakpoint you would do it like this

  <div class="card collapse-expand-lg">
    <div class="card-header">
      <button class="navbar-toggler navbar-light" type="button"
              data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#target"
              aria-controls="target" aria-expanded="false"
              aria-label="Toggle navigation">
              <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
      </button>
    </div>
    <div id="target" class="collapse navbar-collapse">
      <div class="card-body">
        Lorem ipsum
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  Maybe someday I will figure out how to get this to work with
  the navbar classes as they are. But that day is not today.
