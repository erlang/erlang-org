        release_note: "Users can now configure ETS tables with the {write_concurrency, auto} option. This option forces tables to automatically change the number of locks that are used at run-time depending on how much concurrency is detected. The {decentralized_counters, true} option is enabled by default when {write_concurrency, auto} is active.\n\nBenchmark results comparing this option with the other ETS optimization options are available here:\n\nhttps://erlang.org/bench/ets_bench_result_lock_config.html\n\n"

        release_note: "The signal queue of a process with message_queue_data=off_heap* has been optimized to allow parallel reception of signals from multiple processes.\n\nThis is possible to do as Erlang only guarantees that signals (i.e., message signals and non-message signals) sent from a single process to another process are ordered in send order. However, there are no ordering guarantees for signals sent from different processes to a particular process. Therefore, several processes can send signals in parallel to a specific process without synchronizing with each other. However, such signal sending was previously always serialized as the senders had to acquire the lock for the outer signal queue of the receiving process. This parallel signal sending optimization yields much better scalability for signal sending than what was previously possible, see https://erlang.org/bench/sigq_bench_result.html for benchmark results.\n\n* Information about how to enable the message_queue_data=off_heap setting can be found in the documentation of the function erlang:process_flag/2.\n\n"

This will cause fully connected partitions to form instead of leaving the network in a state with overlapping partitions.\n\nPrevention of overlapping partitions can be disabled using the prevent_overlapping_partitions kernel(6) parameter, making global behave like it used to do. This is, however, problematic for all applications expecting a fully connected network to be provided, such as for example mnesia, but also for global itself. A network of overlapping partitions might cause the internal state of global to become inconsistent. Such an inconsistency can remain even after such partitions have been brought together to form a fully connected network again. The effect on other applications that expects that a fully connected network is maintained may vary, but they might misbehave in very subtle hard to detect ways during such a partitioning. Since you might get hard to detect issues without this fix, you are strongly advised not to disable this fix. Also note that this fix has to be enabled on all nodes in the network in order to work properly.\n\n"

However, there are no ordering guarantees for signals sent from different processes to a particular process. Therefore, several processes can send signals in parallel to a specific process without synchronizing with each other. However, such signal sending was previously always serialized as the senders had to acquire the lock for the outer signal queue of the receiving process. This parallel signal sending optimization yields much better scalability for signal sending than what was previously possible, see https://erlang.org/bench/sigq_bench_result.html for benchmark results.\n\n* Information about how to enable the message_queue_data=off_heap setting can be found in the documentation of the function erlang:process_flag/2.\n\n"

        release_note: "*** HIGHLIGHT ***\n\n*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***\n\nAs of OTP 25, global will by default prevent overlapping partitions due to network issues by actively disconnecting from nodes that reports that they have lost connections to other nodes. This will cause fully connected partitions to form instead of leaving the network in a state with overlapping partitions.\n\nPrevention of overlapping partitions can be disabled using the prevent_overlapping_partitions kernel(6) parameter, making global behave like it used to do. This is, however, problematic for all applications expecting a fully connected network to be provided, such as for example mnesia, but also for global itself. A network of overlapping partitions might cause the internal state of global to become inconsistent. Such an inconsistency can remain even after such partitions have been brought together to form a fully connected network again. The effect on other applications that expects that a fully connected network is maintained may vary, but they might misbehave in very subtle hard to detect ways during such a partitioning. Since you might get hard to detect issues without this fix, you are strongly advised not to disable this fix. Also note that this fix has to be enabled on all nodes in the network in order to work properly.\n\n"
