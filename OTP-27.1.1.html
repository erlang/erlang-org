        type: "## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions"
        release_note: "Servers configured to support only version (pre TLS-1.2) should ignore hello\nversion extension, as it is an unknown extension to them, this will result in\nthat new clients that do not support the old server version will get an\ninsufficient security alert from the server and not a protocol version alert,\nthis is consistent with how old servers not able to support higher protocol\nversions work."
