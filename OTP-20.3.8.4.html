        release_note: "A bug in ASN.1 BER decoding has been fixed. When decoding a recursively enclosed term the length was not propagated to that term decoding, so if the length of the enclosed term was longer than the enclosing that error was not dectected.\n\nA hard coded C stack limitation for decoding recursive ASN.1 terms has been introduced. This is currently set to 8 kWords giving a nesting depth of about 1000 levels. Deeper terms can not be decoded, which should not be much of a real world limitation.\n\n"
