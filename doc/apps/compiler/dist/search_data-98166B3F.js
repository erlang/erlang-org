Inlining means that a call to a function is replaced with the\nfunction body with the arguments replaced with the actual values. The\nsemantics are preserved, except if exceptions are generated in the\ninlined code, in which case exceptions are reported as occurring in\nthe function the body was inlined into. Also, `function_clause`\nexceptions are converted to similar `case_clause` exceptions.\n\nWhen a function is inlined, the original function is kept if it is exported\n(either by an explicit export or if the option `export_all` was given) or if not\nall calls to the function are inlined.\n\nInlining does not necessarily improve running time. For example, inlining can\nincrease Beam stack use, which probably is detrimental to performance for\nrecursive functions.\n\nInlining is never default. It must be explicitly enabled with a compiler option\nor a `-compile()` attribute in the source module.\n\nTo enable inlining, either use the option `inline` to let the compiler decide\nwhich functions to inline, or `{inline,[{Name,Arity},...]}` to have the compiler\ninline all calls to the given functions. If the option is given inside a\n`compile` directive in an Erlang module, `{Name,Arity}` can be written as\n`Name/Arity`.\n\nExample of explicit inlining:\n\n```erlang\n-compile({inline,[pi/0]}).\n\npi() -> 3.1416.\n```\n\nExample of implicit inlining:\n\n```text\n-compile(inline).\n```\n\nThe option `{inline_size,Size}` controls how large functions that are allowed to\nbe inlined.

An\nobject code file is created if the compilation succeeds without errors. It is\nconsidered to be an error if the module name in the source code is not the same\nas the basename of the output file.\n\nAvailable options:\n\n- **`brief`** - Restricts error and warning messages to a single line\n  of output.  As of Erlang/OTP 24, the compiler will by default also\n  display the part of the source code that the message refers to.\n\n- **`basic_validation`** - This option is a fast way to test whether a module\n  will compile successfully. This is useful for code generators that want to\n  verify the code that they emit. No code is generated. If warnings are enabled,\n  warnings generated by the `erl_lint` module (such as warnings for unused\n  variables and functions) are also returned.\n\n  Use option `strong_validation` to generate all warnings that the compiler\n  would generate.\n\n- **`strong_validation`** - Similar to option `basic_validation`. No code is\n  generated, but more compiler passes are run to ensure that warnings generated\n  by the optimization passes are generated (such as clauses that will not match,\n  or expressions that are guaranteed to fail with an exception at runtime).\n\n- **`no_docs`**{: #no_docs } - The compiler by default extracts\n  [documentation](`e:system:documentation.md`) from\n  [`-doc` attributes](`e:system:modules.md#documentation-attributes`) and places\n  them in the [`Docs` chunk](`t:beam_lib:chunkid/0`) according to\n  [EEP-48](`e:kernel:eep48_chapter.md`).\n\n  This option switches off the placement of\n  [`-doc` attributes](`e:system:modules.md#documentation-attributes`) in the\n  [`Docs` chunk](`t:beam_lib:chunkid/0`).\n\n- **`binary`** - The compiler returns the object code in a binary instead of\n  creating an object file. If successful, the compiler returns\n  `{ok,ModuleName,Binary}`.\n\n- **`bin_opt_info`** - The compiler will emit informational warnings about\n  binary matching optimizations (both successful and unsuccessful). For more\n  information, see the section about\n  [bin_opt_info](`e:system:binaryhandling.md#bin_opt_info`) in the Efficiency\n  Guide.\n\n- **`{compile_info, [{atom(), term()}]}`** - Allows compilers built on top of\n  `compile` to attach extra compilation metadata to the `compile_info` chunk in\n  the generated BEAM file.\n\n  It is advised for compilers to remove all non-deterministic information if the\n  `deterministic` option is supported and it was supplied by the user.\n\n- **`compressed`** - The compiler will compress the generated object code, which\n  can be useful for embedded systems.\n\n- **`debug_info`** - [](){: #debug_info } Includes debug information in the form\n  of [Erlang Abstract Format](`e:erts:absform.md`) in the `debug_info` chunk of\n  the compiled beam module. Tools such as Debugger, Xref, and Cover require the\n  debug information to be included.\n\n  _Warning_: Source code can be reconstructed from the debug information. Use\n  encrypted debug information (`encrypt_debug_info`) to prevent this.\n\n  For details, see [beam_lib(3)](`m:beam_lib#debug_info`).\n\n- **`{debug_info, {Backend, Data}}`** - [](){: #debug_info_backend } Includes\n  custom debug information in the form of a `Backend` module with custom `Data`\n  in the compiled beam module. The given module must implement a `debug_info/4`\n  function and is responsible for generating different code representations, as\n  described in the `debug_info` under [beam_lib(3)](`m:beam_lib#debug_info`).\n\n  _Warning_: Source code can be reconstructed from the debug information. Use\n  encrypted debug information (`encrypt_debug_info`) to prevent this.\n\n- **`{debug_info_key,KeyString}`**\n\n- **`{debug_info_key,{Mode,KeyString}}`** - [](){: #debug_info_key } Includes\n  debug information, but encrypts it so that it cannot be accessed without\n  supplying the key. (To give option `debug_info` as well is allowed, but not\n  necessary.) Using this option is a good way to always have the debug\n  information available during testing, yet protecting the source code.\n\n  `Mode` is the type of crypto algorithm to be used for encrypting the debug\n  information. The default (and currently the only) type is `des3_cbc`.\n\n  For details, see [beam_lib(3)](`m:beam_lib#debug_info`).\n\n- **`encrypt_debug_info`** - [](){: #encrypt_debug_info } Similar to the\n  `debug_info_key` option, but the key is read from an `.erlang.crypt` file.\n\n  For details, see [beam_lib(3)](`m:beam_lib#debug_info`).\n\n- **`deterministic`** - Omit the `options` and `source` tuples in the list\n  returned by `Module:module_info(compile)`, and reduce the paths in stack\n  traces to the module name alone. This option will make it easier to achieve\n  reproducible builds.\n\n- **`{feature, Feature, enable | disable}`** - [](){: #feature-option } Enable\n  (disable) the [feature](`e:system:features.md#features`) `Feature` during\n  compilation. The special feature `all` can be used to enable (disable) all\n  features.\n\n  > #### Note {: .info }\n  >\n  > This option has no effect when used in a `-compile(..)` attribute. Instead,\n  > the `-feature(..)` directive (described next) should be used.\n  >\n  > [](){: #feature-directive } A feature can also be enabled (disabled) using\n  > the `-feature(Feature, enable | disable).` module directive. Note that this\n  > directive can only be present in a prefix of the file, before exports and\n  > function definitions. This is the preferred method of enabling and disabling\n  > features, since it is a local property of a module.\n\n- **`makedep`** - Produces a Makefile rule to track headers dependencies. No\n  object file is produced.\n\n  By default, this rule is written to ` .Pbeam`. However, if option\n  `binary` is set, nothing is written and the rule is returned in `Binary`.\n\n  The output will be encoded in UTF-8.\n\n  For example, if you have the following module:\n\n  ```erlang\n  -module(module).\n\n  -include_lib(\"eunit/include/eunit.hrl\").\n  -include(\"header.hrl\").\n  ```\n\n  The Makefile rule generated by this option looks as follows:\n\n  ```text\n  module.beam: module.erl \\\n    /usr/local/lib/erlang/lib/eunit/include/eunit.hrl \\\n    header.hrl\n  ```\n\n- **`makedep_side_effect`** - The dependencies are created as a side effect to\n  the normal compilation process. This means that the object file will also be\n  produced. This option override the `makedep` option.\n\n- **`{makedep_output, Output}`** - Writes generated rules to `Output` instead of\n  the default ` .Pbeam`. `Output` can be a filename or an `io_device()`. To\n  write to stdout, use `standard_io`. However, if `binary` is set, nothing is\n  written to `Output` and the result is returned to the caller with\n  `{ok, ModuleName, Binary}`.\n\n- **`{makedep_target, Target}`** - Changes the name of the rule emitted to\n  `Target`.\n\n- **`makedep_quote_target`** - Characters in `Target` special to make(1) are\n  quoted.\n\n- **`makedep_add_missing`** - Considers missing headers as generated files and\n  adds them to the dependencies.\n\n- **`makedep_phony`** - Adds a phony target for each dependency.\n\n- **`'P'`** - Produces a listing of the parsed code, after preprocessing and\n  parse transforms, in the file ` .P`. No object file is produced.\n\n- **`'E'`** - Produces a listing of the code, after all source code\n  transformations have been performed, in the file ` .E`. No object file is\n  produced.\n\n- **`'S'`** - Produces a listing of the assembler code in the file ` .S`.\n  No object file is produced.\n\n- **`recv_opt_info`** - The compiler will emit informational warnings about\n  selective `receive` optimizations (both successful and unsuccessful). For more\n  information, see the section about\n  [selective receive optimization](`e:system:eff_guide_processes.md#receiving-messages`)\n  in the Efficiency Guide.\n\n- **`report_errors/report_warnings`** - Causes errors/warnings to be printed as\n  they occur.\n\n- **`report`** - A short form for both `report_errors` and `report_warnings`.\n\n- **`return_errors`** - If this flag is set, `{error,ErrorList,WarningList}` is\n  returned when there are errors.\n\n- **`return_warnings`** - If this flag is set, an extra field, containing\n  `WarningList`, is added to the tuples returned on success.\n\n- **`warnings_as_errors`** - Causes warnings to be treated as errors.\n\n- **`{error_location,line | column}`** - If the value of this flag is `line`,\n  the location [`ErrorLocation`](`m:compile#error_information`) of warnings and\n  errors is a line number. If the value is `column`, `ErrorLocation` includes\n  both a line number and a column number. Default is `column`. This option is\n  supported since Erlang/OTP 24.0.\n\n  If the value of this flag is `column`,\n  [debug information](`m:compile#debug_info`) includes column information.\n\n- **`return`** - A short form for both `return_errors` and `return_warnings`.\n\n- **`verbose`** - Causes more verbose information from the compiler, describing\n  what it is doing.\n\n- **`{source,FileName}`** - Overrides the source file name as presented in\n  `module_info(compile)` and stack traces.\n\n- **`absolute_source`** - Turns the source file name (as presented in\n  `module_info(compile)` and stack traces) into an absolute path, which helps\n  external tools like `perf` and `gdb` find Erlang source code.\n\n- **`{outdir,Dir}`** - Sets a new directory for the object code. The current\n  directory is used for output, except when a directory has been specified with\n  this option.\n\n- **`export_all`** - Causes all functions in the module to be exported.\n\n- **`{i,Dir}`** - Adds `Dir` to the list of directories to be searched when\n  including a file. When encountering an `-include` or `-include_lib` directive,\n  the compiler searches for header files in the following directories:\n\n  1. `\".\"`, the current working directory of the file server\n  1. The base name of the compiled file\n  1. The directories specified using option `i`; the directory specified last is\n     searched first\n\n- **`{d,Macro}`**\n\n- **`{d,Macro,Value}`** - Defines a macro `Macro` to have the value `Value`.\n  `Macro` is of type atom, and `Value` can be any term. The default `Value` is\n  `true`.\n\n- **`{parse_transform,Module}`** - Causes the parse transformation function\n  `Module:parse_transform/2` to be applied to the parsed code before the code is\n  checked for errors.\n\n- **`from_abstr`** - The input file is expected to contain Erlang terms\n  representing forms in abstract format (default file suffix \".abstr\"). Note\n  that the format of such terms can change between releases.\n\n  See also the `no_lint` option.\n\n- **`from_asm`** - The input file is expected to be assembler code (default file\n  suffix \".S\"). Notice that the format of assembler files is not documented, and\n  can change between releases.\n\n- **`from_core`** - The input file is expected to be core code (default file\n  suffix \".core\"). Notice that the format of core files is not documented, and\n  can change between releases.\n\n- **`no_spawn_compiler_process`** - By default, all code is compiled in a\n  separate process which is terminated at the end of compilation. However, some\n  tools, like Dialyzer or compilers for other BEAM languages, may already manage\n  their own worker processes and spawning an extra process may slow the\n  compilation down. In such scenarios, you can pass this option to stop the\n  compiler from spawning an additional process.\n\n- **`no_strict_record_tests`** - This option is not recommended.\n\n  By default, the generated code for operation `Record#record_tag.field`\n  verifies that the tuple `Record` has the correct size for the record, and that\n  the first element is the tag `record_tag`. Use this option to omit the\n  verification code.\n\n- **`no_error_module_mismatch`** - Normally the compiler verifies that\n  the module name given in the source code is the same as the base\n  name of the output file and refuses to generate an output file if\n  there is a mismatch. If there is a good reason for having a module\n  name unrelated to the name of the output file, this option disables\n  that verification (there will not even be a warning if there is a\n  mismatch).\n\n- **`{no_auto_import,[{F,A}, ...]}`** - Makes the function `F/A` no longer being\n  auto-imported from the `erlang` module, which resolves BIF name clashes. This\n  option must be used to resolve name clashes with auto-imported BIFs that existed\n  before Erlang/OTP R14A  when calling a local function with the same name\n  as an auto-imported BIF without module prefix.\n\n  If the BIF is to be called, use the `erlang` module prefix\n  in the call, not `{no_auto_import,[{F,A}, ...]}`.\n\n  If this option is written in the source code, as a `-compile` directive, the\n  syntax `F/A` can be used instead of `{F,A}`. For example:\n\n  ```erlang\n  -compile({no_auto_import,[error/1]}).\n  ```\n\n- **`no_auto_import`** - Do not auto-import any functions from `erlang` module.\n\n- **`no_line_info`** - Omits line number information to produce a slightly\n  smaller output file.\n\n- **`no_lint`** - Skips the pass that checks for errors and warnings. Only\n  applicable together with the `from_abstr` option. This is mainly for\n  implementations of other languages on top of Erlang, which have already done\n  their own checks to guarantee correctness of the code.\n\n  Caveat: When this option is used, there are no guarantees that the code output\n  by the compiler is correct and safe to use. The responsibility for correctness\n  lies on the code or person generating the abstract format. If the code\n  contains errors, the compiler may crash or produce unsafe code.\n\n- **`{extra_chunks, [{binary(), binary()}]}`** - Pass extra chunks to be stored\n  in the `.beam` file. The extra chunks must be a list of tuples with a four\n  byte binary as chunk name followed by a binary with the chunk contents. See\n  `m:beam_lib` for more information.\n\n- **`{check_ssa, Tag :: atom()}`** - Parse and check assertions on the structure\n  and content of the BEAM SSA code produced by the compiler. The `Tag` indicates\n  the set of assertions to check and after which compiler pass the check is\n  performed. This option is internal to the compiler and can be changed or\n  removed at any time without prior warning.\n\n- **`line_coverage`** - [](){: #line_coverage } Instrument the compiled code for\n  line coverage by inserting an `executable_line` instruction for each\n  executable line in the source code. By default, this instruction will be\n  ignored when loading the code.\n\n  To activate the `executable_line` instructions, the runtime system must be\n  started with the option [\\+JPcover](`e:erts:erl_cmd.md#%2BJPcover`) to enable\n  a coverage mode. Alternatively, `code:set_coverage_mode/1` can be used to set\n  a coverage mode before loading the code.\n\n  The coverage information gathered by the instrumented code can be retrieved by\n  calling [code:get_coverage(line, Module)](`code:get_coverage/2`).\n\n- **`force_line_counters`** - [](){: #force_line_counters } When combined with\n  option `line_coverage`, this module will be loaded in the `line_counter`\n  coverage mode, regardless of the current\n  [coverage mode](`code:get_coverage_mode/0`) in the runtime system. This option\n  is used by `m:cover` to load cover-compiled code.\n\nIf warnings are turned on (option `report_warnings` described earlier), the\nfollowing options control what type of warnings that are generated. [](){:\n#erl_lint_options } Except from `{warn_format,Verbosity}`, the following options\nhave two forms:\n\n- A `warn_xxx` form, to turn on the warning.\n- A `nowarn_xxx` form, to turn off the warning.\n\nIn the descriptions that follow, the form that is used to change the default\nvalue are listed.\n\n- **`{warn_format, Verbosity}`** - Causes warnings to be emitted for malformed\n  format strings as arguments to `io:format` and similar functions.\n\n  `Verbosity` selects the number of warnings:\n\n  - `0` = No warnings\n  - `1` = Warnings for invalid format strings and incorrect number of arguments\n  - `2` = Warnings also when the validity cannot be checked, for example, when\n    the format string argument is a variable.\n\n  The default verbosity is `1`. Verbosity `0` can also be selected by option\n  `nowarn_format`.\n\n- **`nowarn_bif_clash`** - This option is removed; it generates a fatal error if\n  used.\n\n  To resolve BIF clashes, use explicit module names or the\n  `{no_auto_import,[F/A]}` compiler directive.\n\n- **`{nowarn_bif_clash, FAs}`** - This option is removed; it generates a fatal\n  error if used.\n\n  To resolve BIF clashes, use explicit module names or the\n  `{no_auto_import,[F/A]}` compiler directive.\n\n- **`nowarn_export_all`** - Turns off warnings for uses of the `export_all`\n  option. Default is to emit a warning if option `export_all` is also given.\n\n- **`warn_export_vars`** - Emits warnings for all implicitly exported variables\n  referred to after the primitives where they were first defined. By default,\n  the compiler only emits warnings for exported variables referred to in a\n  pattern.\n\n- **`nowarn_shadow_vars`** - Turns off warnings for \"fresh\" variables in\n  functional objects or list comprehensions with the same name as some already\n  defined variable. Default is to emit warnings for such variables.\n\n- **`warn_keywords`** - [](){: #warn-keywords } Emits warnings when the code\n  contains atoms that are used as keywords in some\n  [feature](`e:system:features.md#features`). When the feature is enabled, any\n  occurrences will lead to a syntax error. To prevent this, the atom has to be\n  renamed or quoted.\n\n- **`nowarn_unused_function`** - Turns off warnings for unused local functions.\n  Default is to emit warnings for all local functions that are not called\n  directly or indirectly by an exported function. The compiler does not include\n  unused local functions in the generated BEAM file, but the warning is still\n  useful to keep the source code cleaner.\n\n- **`{nowarn_unused_function, FAs}`** - Turns off warnings for unused local\n  functions like `nowarn_unused_function` does, but only for the mentioned local\n  functions. `FAs` is a tuple `{Name,Arity}` or a list of such tuples.\n\n- **`nowarn_deprecated_function`** - Turns off warnings for calls to deprecated\n  functions. Default is to emit warnings for every call to a function known by\n  the compiler to be deprecated. Notice that the compiler does not know about\n  attribute `-deprecated()`, but uses an assembled list of deprecated functions\n  in Erlang/OTP. To do a more general check, the Xref tool can be used. See also\n  [xref(3)](`m:xref#deprecated_function`) and the function `xref:m/1`, also\n  accessible through the function `\\c:xm/1`.\n\n- **`{nowarn_deprecated_function, MFAs}`** - Turns off warnings for calls to\n  deprecated functions like `nowarn_deprecated_function` does, but only for the\n  mentioned functions. `MFAs` is a tuple `{Module,Name,Arity}` or a list of such\n  tuples.\n\n- **`nowarn_deprecated_type`** - Turns off warnings for use of deprecated types.\n  Default is to emit warnings for every use of a type known by the compiler to\n  be deprecated.\n\n- **`nowarn_deprecated_callback`** - Turns off warnings for use of deprecated callbacks.\n  Default is to emit warnings for every use of a callback known by the compiler to\n  be deprecated.\n\n- **`warn_deprecated_catch`** - Enables warnings for use of old style catch\n  expressions of the form `catch Expr` instead of the modern `try ... catch\n  ... end`. You may enable this compiler option on the project level and\n  add `-compile(nowarn_deprecated_catch).` to individual files which still\n  contain old catches in order to prevent new uses from getting added.\n\n- **`nowarn_removed`** - Turns off warnings for calls to functions that have\n  been removed. Default is to emit warnings for every call to a function known\n  by the compiler to have been recently removed from Erlang/OTP.\n\n- **`{nowarn_removed, ModulesOrMFAs}`** - Turns off warnings for calls to\n  modules or functions that have been removed. Default is to emit warnings for\n  every call to a function known by the compiler to have been recently removed\n  from Erlang/OTP.\n\n- **`nowarn_obsolete_guard`** - Turns off warnings for calls to old type testing\n  BIFs, such as `pid/1` and [`list/1`](`t:list/1`). See the\n  [Erlang Reference Manual](`e:system:expressions.md#guards`) for a complete\n  list of type testing BIFs and their old equivalents. Default is to emit\n  warnings for calls to old type testing BIFs.\n\n- **`warn_unused_import`** - Emits warnings for unused imported functions.\n  Default is to emit no warnings for unused imported functions.\n\n- **`nowarn_underscore_match`** - By default, warnings are emitted when a\n  variable that begins with an underscore is matched after being bound.

They are generated when\nthe compiler happens to notice potential issues during optimization and code\ngeneration.\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> The compiler does not warn for expressions that it does not attempt to\n> optimize. For example, the compiler will emit a warning for `1/0` but not for\n> `X/0`, because `1/0` is a constant expression that the compiler will attempt\n> to evaluate.\n>\n> The absence of warnings does not mean that there are no remaining errors in\n> the code.\n\nOpportunistic warnings can be disabled using the following options:\n\n- **`nowarn_opportunistic`** - Disable all opportunistic warnings.\n\n- **`nowarn_failed`** - Disable warnings for expressions that will always fail\n  (such as `atom+42`).\n\n- **`nowarn_ignored`** - Disable warnings for expressions whose values are\n  ignored.\n\n- **`nowarn_nomatch`** - Disable warnings for patterns that will never match\n  (such as `a=b`) and for guards that always evaluate to `false`.\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> All options, except the include path (`{i,Dir}`), can also be given in the\n> file with attribute `-compile([Option,...])`. Attribute `-compile()` is\n> allowed after the function definitions.\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> Before Erlang/OTP 22, the option `{nowarn_deprecated_function, MFAs}` was only\n> recognized when given in the file with attribute `-compile()`.

Starting from\n> Erlang/OTP 22, all options that can be given in the file can also be given\n> in the option list.\n\nFor debugging of the compiler, or for pure curiosity, the intermediate code\ngenerated by each compiler pass can be inspected. To print a complete list of\nthe options to produce list files, type `compile:options()` at the Erlang shell\nprompt. The options are printed in the order that the passes are executed. If\nmore than one listing option is used, the one representing the earliest pass\ntakes effect.\n\nUnrecognized options are ignored.\n\nBoth `WarningList` and `ErrorList` have the following format:\n\n```text\n[{FileName,[ErrorInfo]}].\n```\n\nThe filename is included here, as the compiler uses the Erlang\npre-processor `epp`, which allows the code to be included in other\nfiles. It is therefore important to know to _which_ file the location\nof an error or a warning refers.\n\n[](){: #error_information }\n\nThe `ErrorInfo` structure has the following format:\n\n```text\n{ErrorLocation, Module, ErrorDescriptor}\n```\n\n`ErrorLocation` is usually the tuple `{Line, Column}`. If option\n`{error_location,line}` has been given, `ErrorLocation` is only the\nline number.  If the error does not correspond to a specific location\n(for example, if the source file does not exist), `ErrorLocation` is\nthe atom `none`.\n\nA string describing the error is obtained with the following call:\n\n```text\nModule:format_error(ErrorDescriptor)\n```","ref":"compile.html#file/2"},{"type":"function","title":"compile.format_error/1","doc":"Uses an `ErrorDescriptor` and returns a deep list of characters that describes\nthe error.\n\nThis function is usually called implicitly when an `ErrorInfo`\nstructure is processed.","ref":"compile.html#format_error/1"},{"type":"type","title":"compile.forms/0","doc":"List of Erlang abstract or Core Erlang format representations, as used by\n`forms/2`.","ref":"compile.html#t:forms/0"},{"type":"function","title":"compile.forms/1","doc":"Is the same as\n[`forms(Forms, [verbose,report_errors,report_warnings])`](`forms/2`).","ref":"compile.html#forms/1"},{"type":"function","title":"compile.forms/2","doc":"Analogous to [`file/1`](`file/1`), but takes a list of forms (in either Erlang\nabstract or Core Erlang format representation) as first argument.\n\nOption `binary` is implicit, that is, no object code file is\nproduced.

Consider this example:\n  \n  ```\n  -module(fun_example).\n  -export([foo/0, bar/0]).\n  -import(m, [max/2, not_a_bif/0]).\n  \n  foo() ->\n      fun max/2.\n  \n  bar() ->\n      fun not_a_bif/0.\n  ```\n  \n  The compiler in Erlang/OTP 27 would generate the following messages:\n  \n  ```text\n  fun_example.erl:9:5: function not_a_bif/0 undefined\n  %    9|     fun not_a_bif/0.\n  %     |     ^\n  \n  fun_example.erl:3:2: Warning: import directive overrides auto-imported BIF max/2 --\n  use \"-compile({no_auto_import,[max/2]}).\" to resolve name clash\n  %    3| -import(m, [max/2, not_a_bif/0]).\n  %     |  ^\n  ```\n  \n  That is, there would be a (cryptic) error for `fun not_a_bif/0`, but only a warning for `fun max/2`.\n  \n  When compiling with this release, both attempts to create a fun will result in error messages (as well as a warning):\n  \n  ```text\n  fun_example.erl:6:5: creating a fun from imported name max/2 is not allowed\n  %    6|     fun max/2.\n  %     |     ^\n  \n  fun_example.erl:9:5: creating a fun from imported name not_a_bif/0 is not allowed\n  %    9|     fun not_a_bif/0.\n  %     |     ^\n  \n  fun_example.erl:3:2: Warning: import directive overrides auto-imported BIF max/2 --\n  use \"-compile({no_auto_import,[max/2]}).\" to resolve name clash\n  %    3| -import(m, [max/2, not_a_bif/0]).\n  %     |  ^\n  ```\n  \n  Also, attempting to call a local function having the same name as auto-imported BIF would result in an error if the BIF was added to Erlang/OTP before R14, and a warning for newer BIFs. This has been changed to always emit a warning. For example:\n  \n  ```\n  -module(bif_example).\n  -export([bar/1]).\n  \n  bar(B) ->\n      is_boolean(B).\n  \n  is_boolean(B) ->\n          B =:= true orelse B =:= false.\n  ```\n  will now result in the following warning instead of an error:\n  \n  ```text\n  if_example.erl:5:5: Warning: ambiguous call of overridden auto-imported BIF is_boolean/1 --\n  use erlang:is_boolean/1 or \"-compile({no_auto_import,[is_boolean/1]}).\" to resolve name clash\n  %    5|     is_boolean(B).\n  %     |     ^\n  ```\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19432 Aux Id: [PR-9246]\n\n- The compiler’s alias analysis pass is now both faster and less conservative, allowing optimizations of records and binary construction to be applied in more cases.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19502 Aux Id: [PR-8695]\n\n- BEAM files no longer include a `Meta` chunk if there are no features used. That slightly decreases the size of BEAM files, and it also ensures that `m(Module)` and `beam_lib:md5(Beam)` will match for preloaded modules.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19524 Aux Id: [PR-9517]\n\n- The license and copyright header has changed format to include an `SPDX-License-Identifier`. At the same time, most files have been updated to follow a uniform standard for license headers.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19575 Aux Id: [PR-9670]\n\n- An  **experimental** API for a native debugger has been added. The main components are the following:\n  \n  * A new compiler option `beam_debug_info` for the Erlang compiler. When given, most optimizations are disabled and debug information suitable for the native debugger are added to generated BEAM files.\n  \n  * A new `+D` emulator flag. When given, the VM becomes \"debuggable\", which means that when modules that been compiled with the `beam_debug_info` option are loaded, the code is instrumented so that one can enable and disable breakpoints on executable lines.\n  \n  * An experimental `erl_debugger` module with a new debugging API. Essentially, it allows a single, local, process to be registered as the \"debugger\" process for the node. This process is the one that will receive messages notifying that a process hit a breakpoint. This way, the front-end implementation of a debugger (such as [edb from WhatApp](https://github.com/WhatsApp/edb)) can be decoupled from OTP.\n  \n  * The `erl_debugger` module also exposes new BIFs to inspect `X` and `Y` registers of a suspended process. Together with new code-information BIFs, this let's a debugger show the values of variables in scope for a suspended process.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19609 Aux Id: [PR-8670], [PR-9334], [PR-9604]\n\n[PR-8494]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/8494\n[PR-8540]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/8540\n[PR-8699]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/8699\n[PR-9094]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/9094\n[PR-8926]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/8926\n[PR-8945]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/8945\n[PR-8975]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/8975\n[PR-8625]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/8625\n[GH-8985]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues/8985\n[PR-9020]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/9020\n[PR-9042]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/9042\n[PR-9122]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/9122\n[PR-9192]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/9192\n[PR-9154]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/9154\n[PR-9246]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/9246\n[PR-8695]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/8695\n[PR-9517]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/9517\n[PR-9670]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/9670\n[PR-8670]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/8670\n[PR-9334]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/9334\n[PR-9604]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/9604","ref":"notes.html#improvements-and-new-features"},{"type":"extras","title":"Compiler 8.6.1.2 - Compiler Release Notes","doc":"","ref":"notes.html#compiler-8-6-1-2"},{"type":"extras","title":"Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions - Compiler Release Notes","doc":"- In rare circumstances, the compiler could crash when compiling code using bit syntax construction.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19722 Aux Id: [GH-10077], [PR-10090]\n\n[GH-10077]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues/10077\n[PR-10090]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/10090","ref":"notes.html#fixed-bugs-and-malfunctions-4"},{"type":"extras","title":"Compiler 8.6.1.1 - Compiler Release Notes","doc":"","ref":"notes.html#compiler-8-6-1-1"},{"type":"extras","title":"Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions - Compiler Release Notes","doc":"- Fixed a bug that could cause empty bitstring matches to always succeed, even when they should not.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19711 Aux Id: [GH-10047], [PR-10048]\n\n[GH-10047]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues/10047\n[PR-10048]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/10048","ref":"notes.html#fixed-bugs-and-malfunctions-5"},{"type":"extras","title":"Compiler 8.6.1 - Compiler Release Notes","doc":"","ref":"notes.html#compiler-8-6-1"},{"type":"extras","title":"Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions - Compiler Release Notes","doc":"- Fix the compiler crash when the inner-most tuple in a nested tuple with 3 layers is updated.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19561 Aux Id: ERIERL-1208, ERIERL-1210, [PR-9650]\n\n[PR-9650]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/9650","ref":"notes.html#fixed-bugs-and-malfunctions-6"},{"type":"extras","title":"Compiler 8.6 - Compiler Release Notes","doc":"","ref":"notes.html#compiler-8-6"},{"type":"extras","title":"Improvements and New Features - Compiler Release Notes","doc":"- The `beam_validator` pass in the compiler that validates generated BEAM now does stronger checks for binary syntax matching.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19449 Aux Id: [PR-9338]\n\n[PR-9338]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/9338","ref":"notes.html#improvements-and-new-features-1"},{"type":"extras","title":"Compiler 8.5.5 - Compiler Release Notes","doc":"","ref":"notes.html#compiler-8-5-5"},{"type":"extras","title":"Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions - Compiler Release Notes","doc":"- Eliminated a bug in the alias analysis pass that could potentially cause unsafe optimizations of binary construction or record updates.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19455 Aux Id: [PR-9356]\n\n[PR-9356]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/9356","ref":"notes.html#fixed-bugs-and-malfunctions-7"},{"type":"extras","title":"Compiler 8.5.4 - Compiler Release Notes","doc":"","ref":"notes.html#compiler-8-5-4"},{"type":"extras","title":"Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions - Compiler Release Notes","doc":"- Fixed a crash in the common sub-expression elimination pass.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19243 Aux Id: [GH-8818], [PR-8838]\n\n- Fixed a bug where bogus code was generated for consecutive calls to `erlang:setelement/2`, potentially crashing the runtime system.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19270 Aux Id: [GH-8783], [PR-8898]\n\n- When the `line_coverage` option was used, exceptions could show the wrong line for where the exception was raised.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19282 Aux Id: [PR-8907]\n\n- The `line_coverage` option would be ignored if given in a `compile()` attribute within a module.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19309 Aux Id: [GH-8942], [PR-8970]\n\n- A segment matching a float in a binary generator will now skip any invalid float (such as a NaN) and continue matching the rest of the binary.

Now all\n  strings will be stored expanded to lists (such as `[$a,$b,$c]`) in the\n  constant pool. That means that the string will be faster to use at run-time,\n  but that it will require more space even when not used.

If\n   there are no edges to the landing pad block except from the block\n   containing the `new_try_tag`, the compiler will remove the\n   redundant exception handler.\n * The extraction of the class, reason and stack trace from the result\n   of the `landingpad` instruction must be done in that\n   order. Omitting the extraction of elements which are unused is\n   allowed.\n * Both the landing pad block and the final protected block must end\n   with a `kill_try_tag` instruction. Trying to share the\n   `kill_try_tag` epilogue between the last protected block and the\n   landing pad is unlikely to work.\n\nThe translation of an old-style `catch` expression into BEAM SSA has\nthe following structure:\n\n    @tag = new_try_tag `try`\n\tbr @tag, ^protected_block0, ^landing_pad_block\n\n\tprotected_block0:\n\t  @success0 = ... % Something that could raise an exception\n\t  br @success0, ^protected_block1, ^landing_pad_block\n\n\t...\n\n\tprotected_blockN:\n\t  % The end of the protected code\n\t  @successful_result = .... % The result of a successful computation\n\t  br ^common_end_of_catch\n\n\tlanding_pad_block:\n\t   @aggregate = landingpad catch, @tag\n\t   @catched_val = extract @ssa_agg, `0`\n\t   br ^common_end_of_catch\n\n\tcommon_end_of_catch:\n\t  @tmp = phi { @catched_val, ^landing_pad_block },\n\t             { @successful_result, ^protected_blockN }\n\t  @result_of_catch_expr = catch_end @tag, @tmp\n\nJust as for a `try`-`catch` expression all code that can cause an\nexception in one of the protected blocks must have explicit control\nflow edges to the landing pad block.\n\nException Re-issuing\n--------------------\n\nA typical user-written `try`-`catch` expression will catch a subset of\nall possible exception classes and reasons and leave unhandled\nexceptions to a handler further up the call stack.

For\nexample, unless a transform produces crashing code, it is hard to\ndetect that the transform is broken. Likewise missing an optimization\nopportunity is also hard to detect.\n\nTo simplify the creation of tests on BEAM SSA the compiler has an\ninternal mode in which it parses and checks assertions on the\nstructure and content of the produced BEAM SSA code. This is a short\nintroduction to the syntax and semantics of the SSA checker\nfunctionality.\n\nSyntax\n------\n\nSSA checks are embedded in the source code as comments starting with\nwith one of `%ssa%`, `%%ssa%` or `%%%ssa%`. This is a short\nintroduction the syntax, for the full syntax please refer to the\n`ssa_check_when_clause` production in `erl_parse.yrl`.\n\nSSA checks can be placed inside any Erlang function, for example:\n\n    t0() ->\n    %ssa% () when post_ssa_opt ->\n    %ssa%   ret(#{}).\n      #{}.\n\nwill check that `t0/0` returns the literal `#{}`. If we want to check\nthat a function returns its first formal parameter, we can write:\n\n    t1(A, _B) ->\n    %ssa% (X, _) when post_ssa_opt ->\n    %ssa%   ret(X).\n      A.\n\nNote how we match the first formal parameter using `X`. The reason for\nhaving our own formal parameters for the SSA check, is that we don't\nwant to introduce new identifiers at the Erlang level to support\nSSA-level checks. Consider if `t1/2` had been defined as `t1([A|As],\nB)` we would have had to introduce a new identifier for the aggregate\nvalue `[A|As]`.\n\nThe full syntax for a SSA check clause is:\n\n     ? ( ) when   ->   '.'\n\nwhere ` ` can be one of `pass` (the check must\nsucceed), `fail` and `xfail` (the check must fail). Omitting\n` ` is parsed as an implicit `pass`.\n\n` ` is a comma-separated list of variables.\n\n` ` specifies when in the compiler pipeline to run\nthe checks. For now the only supported value for ` `\nis `post_ssa_opt` which runs the checks after the `ssa_opt` pass.\n\n` ` is a comma-separated list of matches against the BEAM SSA\ncode. For non-flow-control operations the syntax is:\n\n      =   (   )  ?\n\nwhere ` ` is the `#b_set.op` field from the internal SSA\nrepresentation. BIFs are written as `bif: `.\n\n` ` is a comma-separated list of variables or literals.\n\nFor flow control operations and labels, the syntax is as follows:\n\n    br( ,  ,  )\n\n    switch( ,  , [{ , },...])\n\n\tret( )\n\n\tlabel  \n\nwhere ` ` is a literal or a variable.\n\nA check can also include an assertion on operation annotations. The\nassertion is written as a map-like pattern following the argument\nlist, for example:\n\n    t0() ->\n    %ssa% () when post_ssa_opt ->\n    %ssa% _ = call(fun return_int/0) { result_type => {t_integer,{17,17}},\n    %ssa%                              location => {_,32} },\n    %ssa% _ = call(fun return_tuple/0) {\n    %ssa%    result_type => {t_tuple,2,true,#{1 => {t_integer,{1,1}},\n    %ssa%                                     2 => {t_integer,{2,2}}}}\n    %ssa% }.\n        X = return_int(),\n        Y = return_tuple(),\n        {X, Y}.\n\nSemantics\n---------\n\nWhen an SSA assertion is matched against the BEAM SSA for a function,\npatterns are applied sequentially. If the current pattern doesn't\nmatch, the checker tries with the next instruction. If the checker\nreaches the end of the SSA representation without having matched all\npatterns, the check is considered failed otherwise the assertion is\nconsidered successful. When a pattern is matched against an SSA\noperation, the values of variables already bound are considered and if\nthe patterns matches, free variables introduced in the successfully\nmatched pattern are bound to the values they have in the matched\noperation.\n\nCompiler integration\n--------------------\n\nThe BEAM SSA checker is enabled by the compiler option\n`{check_ssa,post_ssa_opt}`. When enabled, a failed SSA assertion will\nbe reported using the same mechanisms as an ordinary compilation\nerror.\n\nLimitations\n-----------\n\n* Unbound variables are not allowed in the key-part of map literals nor\nin annotation assertions.","ref":"ssa_checks.html"}],"proglang":"erlang","content_type":"text/markdown","producer":{"name":"ex_doc","version":"0.38.1"}}
