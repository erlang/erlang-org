(Note the use of `update_tree/2` to preserve node\nattributes.)

For example:\n\n```erlang\nTuple = ?Q(\"{foo, 42}\"),\n?Q(\"{foo, _@Number}\") = Tuple,\nCall = ?Q(\"foo:bar(_@Number)\")\n```\n\nCalling `merl:print(Call)` will then print the following code:\n\n```erlang\nfoo:bar(42)\n```\n\nThe `?Q` macros turn the quoted code fragments into ASTs, and lifts\nmetavariables such as `_@Tuple` and `_@Number` to the level of your Erlang code,\nso you can use the corresponding Erlang variables `Tuple` and `Number` directly.\nThis is the most straightforward way to use Merl, and in many cases it's all you\nneed.\n\nYou can even write case switches using `?Q` macros as patterns. For example:\n\n```erlang\ncase AST of\n    ?Q(\"{foo, _@Foo}\") -> handle(Foo);\n    ?Q(\"{bar, _@Bar}\") when erl_syntax:is_integer(Bar) -> handle(Bar);\n    _ -> handle_default()\nend\n```\n\nThese case switches only allow `?Q(...)` or `_` as clause patterns, and the\nguards may contain any expressions, not just Erlang guard expressions.\n\nIf the macro `MERL_NO_TRANSFORM` is defined before the `merl.hrl` header file is\nincluded, the parse transform used by Merl will be disabled, and in that case,\nthe match expressions `?Q(...) = ...`, case switches using `?Q(...)` patterns,\nand automatic metavariables like `_@Tuple` cannot be used in your code, but the\nMerl macros and functions still work. To do metavariable substitution, you need\nto use the `?Q(Text, Map)` macro. For example:\n\n```erlang\nTuple = ?Q(\"{foo, _@bar, _@baz}\", [{bar, Bar}, {baz,Baz}])\n```\n\nThe text given to a `?Q(Text)` macro can be either a single string or a list of\nstrings. The latter is useful when you need to split a long expression over\nmultiple lines. For example:\n\n```erlang\n?Q([\"case _@Expr of\",\n    \"  {foo, X} -> f(X);\",\n    \"  {bar, X} -> g(X)\",\n    \"  _ -> h(X)\"\n\"end\"])\n```\n\nIf there is a syntax error somewhere in the text (like the missing semicolon in\nthe second clause above) this allows Merl to generate an error message pointing\nto the exact line in your source code. (Just remember to comma-separate the\nstrings in the list, otherwise Erlang will concatenate the string fragments as\nif they were a single string.)","ref":"merl.html#module-quick-start"},{"type":"module","title":"Metavariable syntax - merl","doc":"There are several ways to write a metavariable in your quoted code:\n\n- Atoms starting with `@`, for example `'@foo'` or `'@Foo'`\n- Variables starting with `_@`, for example `_@bar` or `_@Bar`\n- Strings starting with `\"'@`, for example `\"'@File\"`\n- Integers starting with 909, for example `9091` or `909123`\n\nFollowing the prefix, one or more `_` or `0` characters may be used to indicate\n\"lifting\" of the variable one or more levels, and after that, a `@` or `9`\ncharacter indicates a glob metavariable (matching zero or more elements in a\nsequence) rather than a normal metavariable. For example:\n\n- `'@_foo'` is lifted one level, and `_@__foo` is lifted two levels\n- `_@@bar` is a glob variable, and `_@_@bar` is a lifted glob variable\n- `90901` is a lifted variable,`90991` is a glob variable, and `9090091` is a\n  glob variable lifted two levels\n\n(Note that the last character in the name is never considered to be a lift or\nglob marker, hence, `_@__` and `90900` are only lifted one level, not two. Also\nnote that globs only matter for matching; when doing substitutions, a non-glob\nvariable can be used to inject a sequence of elements, and vice versa.)\n\nIf the name after the prefix and any lift and glob markers is `_` or `0`, the\nvariable is treated as an anonymous catch-all pattern in matches. For example,\n`_@_`, `_@@_`, `_@__`, or even `_@__@_`.\n\nFinally, if the name without any prefixes or lift/glob markers begins with an\nuppercase character, as in `_@Foo` or `_@_@Foo`, it will become a variable on\nthe Erlang level, and can be used to easily deconstruct and construct syntax\ntrees:\n\n```erlang\ncase Input of\n    ?Q(\"{foo, _@Number}\") -> ?Q(\"foo:bar(_@Number)\");\n    ...\n```\n\nWe refer to these as \"automatic metavariables\". If in addition the name ends\nwith `@`, as in `_@Foo@`, the value of the variable as an Erlang term will be\nautomatically converted to the corresponding abstract syntax tree when used to\nconstruct a larger tree. For example, in:\n\n```erlang\nBar = {bar, 42},\nFoo = ?Q(\"{foo, _@Bar@}\")\n```\n\n(where Bar is just some term, not a syntax tree) the result `Foo` will be a\nsyntax tree representing `{foo, {bar, 42}}`. This avoids the need for temporary\nvariables in order to inject data, as in\n\n```erlang\nTmpBar = erl_syntax:abstract(Bar),\nFoo = ?Q(\"{foo, _@TmpBar}\")\n```\n\nIf the context requires an integer rather than a variable, an atom, or a string,\nyou cannot use the uppercase convention to mark an automatic metavariable.\nInstead, if the integer (without the `909`\\-prefix and lift/glob markers) ends\nin a `9`, the integer will become an Erlang-level variable prefixed with `Q`,\nand if it ends with `99` it will also be automatically abstracted. For example,\nthe following will increment the arity of the exported function f:\n\n```erlang\ncase Form of\n    ?Q(\"-export([f/90919]).\") ->\n        Q2 = erl_syntax:concrete(Q1) + 1,\n        ?Q(\"-export([f/909299]).\");\n    ...\n```","ref":"merl.html#module-metavariable-syntax"},{"type":"module","title":"When to use the various forms of metavariables - merl","doc":"Merl can only parse a fragment of text if it follows the basic syntactical rules\nof Erlang. In most places, a normal Erlang variable can be used as metavariable,\nfor example:\n\n```erlang\n?Q(\"f(_@Arg)\") = Expr\n```\n\nbut if you want to match on something like the name of a function, you have to\nuse an atom as metavariable:\n\n```erlang\n?Q(\"'@Name'() -> _@@_.\" = Function\n```\n\n(note the anonymous glob variable `_@@_` to ignore the function body).\n\nIn some contexts, only a string or an integer is allowed. For example, the\ndirective `-file(Name, Line)` requires that `Name` is a string literal and\n`Line` an integer literal:\n\n```erlang\n?Q(\"-file(\\\"'@File\\\", 9090).\") = ?Q(\"-file(\\\"foo.erl\\\", 42).\")).\n```\n\nThis will extract the string literal `\"foo.erl\"` into the variable `Foo`. Note\nthe use of the anonymous variable `9090` to ignore the line number. To match and\nalso bind a metavariable that must be an integer literal, we can use the\nconvention of ending the integer with a 9, turning it into a Q-prefixed variable\non the Erlang level (see the previous section).\n\n#### Globs\n\nWhenever you want to match out a number of elements in a sequence (zero or more)\nrather than a fixed set of elements, you need to use a glob. For example:\n\n```erlang\n?Q(\"{_@@Elements}\") = ?Q({a, b, c})\n```\n\nwill bind Elements to the list of individual syntax trees representing the atoms\n`a`, `b`, and `c`. This can also be used with static prefix and suffix elements\nin the sequence. For example:\n\n```erlang\n?Q(\"{a, b, _@@Elements}\") = ?Q({a, b, c, d})\n```\n\nwill bind Elements to the list of the `c` and `d` subtrees, and\n\n```erlang\n?Q(\"{_@@Elements, c, d}\") = ?Q({a, b, c, d})\n```\n\nwill bind Elements to the list of the `a` and `b` subtrees. You can even use\nplain metavariables in the prefix or suffix:\n\n```erlang\n?Q(\"{_@First, _@@Rest}\") = ?Q({a, b, c})\n```\n\nor\n\n```erlang\n?Q(\"{_@@_, _@Last}\") = ?Q({a, b, c})\n```\n\n(ignoring all but the last element). However, you cannot have two globs as part\nof the same sequence.\n\n#### Lifted metavariables\n\nIn some cases, the Erlang syntax rules make it impossible to place a\nmetavariable directly where you would like it. For example, you cannot write:\n\n```erlang\n?Q(\"-export([_@@Name]).\")\n```\n\nto match out all name/arity pairs in the export list, or to insert a list of\nexports in a declaration, because the Erlang parser only allows elements on the\nform `A/I` (where `A` is an atom and `I` an integer) in the export list. A\nvariable like the above is not allowed, but neither is a single atom or integer,\nso `'@@Name'` or `909919` would not work either.\n\nWhat you have to do in such cases is to write your metavariable in a\nsyntactically valid position, and use lifting markers to denote where it should\nreally apply, as in:\n\n```erlang\n?Q(\"-export(['@_@Name'/0]).\")\n```\n\nThis causes the variable to be lifted (after parsing) to the next higher level\nin the syntax tree, replacing that entire subtree. In this case, the\n`'@_@Name'/0` will be replaced with `'@@Name'`, and the `/0` part was just used\nas dummy notation and will be discarded.\n\nYou may even need to apply lifting more than once. To match the entire export\nlist as a single syntax tree, you can write:\n\n```erlang\n?Q(\"-export(['@__Name'/0]).\")\n```\n\nusing two underscores, but with no glob marker this time. This will make the\nentire `['@__Name'/0]` part be replaced with `'@Name'`.\n\nSometimes, the tree structure of a code fragment is not very obvious, and parts\nof the structure may be invisible when printed as source code. For instance, a\nsimple function definition like the following:\n\n```erlang\nzero() -> 0.\n```\n\nconsists of the name (the atom `zero`), and a list of clauses containing the\nsingle clause `() -> 0`. The clause consists of an argument list (empty), a\nguard (empty), and a body (which is always a list of expressions) containing the\nsingle expression `0`. This means that to match out the name and the list of\nclauses of any function, you'll need to use a pattern like\n`?Q(\"'@Name'() -> _@_@Body.\")`, using a dummy clause whose body is a glob lifted\none level.\n\nTo visualize the structure of a syntax tree, you can use the function\n`merl:show(T)`, which prints a summary. For example, entering\n\n```erlang\nmerl:show(merl:quote(\"inc(X, Y) when Y > 0 -> X + Y.\"))\n```\n\nin the Erlang shell will print the following (where the `+` signs separate\ngroups of subtrees on the same level):\n\n```text\nfunction: inc(X, Y) when ... -> X + Y.\n  atom: inc\n  +\n  clause: (X, Y) when ... -> X + Y\n    variable: X\n    variable: Y\n    +\n    disjunction: Y > 0\n      conjunction: Y > 0\n        infix_expr: Y > 0\n          variable: Y\n          +\n          operator: >\n          +\n          integer: 0\n    +\n    infix_expr: X + Y\n      variable: X\n      +\n      operator: +\n      +\n      variable: Y\n```\n\nThis shows another important non-obvious case: a clause guard, even if it's as\nsimple as `Y > 0`, always consists of a single disjunction of one or more\nconjunctions of tests, much like a tuple of tuples. Thus:\n\n- `\"when _@Guard ->\"` will only match a guard with exactly one test\n- `\"when _@@Guard ->\"` will match a guard with one or more comma-separated tests\n  (but no semicolons), binding `Guard` to the list of tests\n- `\"when _@_Guard ->\"` will match just like the previous pattern, but binds\n  `Guard` to the conjunction subtree\n- `\"when _@_@Guard ->\"` will match an arbitrary nonempty guard, binding `Guard`\n  to the list of conjunction subtrees\n- `\"when _@__Guard ->\"` will match like the previous pattern, but binds `Guard`\n  to the whole disjunction subtree\n- and finally, `\"when _@__@Guard ->\"` will match any clause, binding `Guard` to\n  `[]` if the guard is empty and to `[Disjunction]` otherwise\n\nThus, the following pattern matches all possible clauses:\n\n```erlang\n     \"(_@Args) when _@__@Guard -> _@Body\"\n```","ref":"merl.html#module-when-to-use-the-various-forms-of-metavariables"},{"type":"function","title":"merl.alpha/2","doc":"Alpha converts a pattern (renames variables).\n\nSimilar to tsubst/1, but only renames variables (including globs).\n\n_See also: _`tsubst/2`.","ref":"merl.html#alpha/2"},{"type":"function","title":"merl.compile/1","doc":"Equivalent to  compile(Code, []) .","ref":"merl.html#compile/1"},{"type":"function","title":"merl.compile/2","doc":"Compile a syntax tree or list of syntax trees representing a module into a\nbinary BEAM object.\n\n_See also: _`compile/1`, `compile_and_load/2`.","ref":"merl.html#compile/2"},{"type":"function","title":"merl.compile_and_load/1","doc":"Equivalent to  compile_and_load(Code, []) .","ref":"merl.html#compile_and_load/1"},{"type":"function","title":"merl.compile_and_load/2","doc":"Compile a syntax tree or list of syntax trees representing a module and load the\nresulting module into memory.\n\n_See also: _`compile/2`, `compile_and_load/1`.","ref":"merl.html#compile_and_load/2"},{"type":"type","title":"merl.default_action/0","doc":"","ref":"merl.html#t:default_action/0"},{"type":"type","title":"merl.env/0","doc":"","ref":"merl.html#t:env/0"},{"type":"type","title":"merl.guard_test/0","doc":"","ref":"merl.html#t:guard_test/0"},{"type":"type","title":"merl.guarded_action/0","doc":"","ref":"merl.html#t:guarded_action/0"},{"type":"type","title":"merl.guarded_actions/0","doc":"","ref":"merl.html#t:guarded_actions/0"},{"type":"type","title":"merl.id/0","doc":"","ref":"merl.html#t:id/0"},{"type":"type","title":"merl.location/0","doc":"","ref":"merl.html#t:location/0"},{"type":"function","title":"merl.match/2","doc":"Match a pattern against a syntax tree (or patterns against syntax trees)\nreturning an environment mapping variable names to subtrees; the environment is\nalways sorted on keys.\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> Multiple occurrences of metavariables in the pattern is not\n> allowed, but is not checked.\n\n_See also: _`switch/2`, `template/1`.","ref":"merl.html#match/2"},{"type":"function","title":"merl.meta_template/1","doc":"Turn a template into a syntax tree representing the template.\n\nMeta-variables in the template are turned into normal Erlang variables\nif their names (after the metavariable prefix characters) begin with\nan uppercase character.

The layer makes it possible to transparently\nattach source-code comments and user annotations to nodes of the tree. Using the\nabstract layer makes applications less sensitive to changes in the `m:erl_parse`\ndata structures, only requiring the `erl_syntax` module to be up-to-date.\n\nThe pretty printer `m:erl_prettypr` is implemented on top of the library module\n`m:prettypr`: this is a powerful and flexible generic pretty printing library,\nwhich is also distributed separately.\n\nFor a short demonstration of parsing and pretty-printing, simply compile the\nincluded module [assets/demo.erl](assets/demo.erl), and execute `demo:run()` from the Erlang\nshell.
