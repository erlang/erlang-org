The\n[User's Guide](using_public_key.md#verify_hostname) and\n[code examples](using_public_key.md#verify_hostname_examples) describes this\nfunction more detailed.\n\nThe option funs are described here:\n\n- **`match_fun`**\n\n  ```erlang\n  fun(ReferenceId::ReferenceId() | FQDN::string(),\n      PresentedId::{dNSName,string()} | {uniformResourceIdentifier,string() |\n                   {iPAddress,list(byte())} | {OtherId::atom()|oid(),term()}})\n  ```\n\n  This function replaces the default host name matching rules. The fun should\n  return a boolean to tell if the Reference ID and Presented ID matches or not.\n  The match fun can also return a third value, value, the atom `default`, if the\n  default matching rules shall apply. This makes it possible to augment the\n  tests with a special case:\n\n  ```text\n  fun(....) -> true;   % My special case\n     (_, _) -> default % all others falls back to the inherit tests\n  end\n  ```\n\n  See `pkix_verify_hostname_match_fun/1` for a function that takes a protocol\n  name as argument and returns a `fun/2` suitable for this option and\n  [Re-defining the match operation](using_public_key.md#redefining_match_op) in\n  the User's Guide for an example.\n\n  > #### Note {: .info }\n  >\n  > Reference Id values given as binaries will be converted to strings, and ip\n  > references may be given in string format that is \"10.0.1.1\" or\n  > \"1234::5678:9012\" as well as on the format `t:inet:ip_address/0`\n\n- **`fail_callback`** - If a matching fails, there could be circumstances when\n  the certificate should be accepted anyway. Think for example of a web browser\n  where you choose to accept an outdated certificate. This option enables\n  implementation of such an exception but for hostnames. This `fun/1` is called\n  when no `ReferenceID` matches. The return value of the fun (a `t:boolean/0`)\n  decides the outcome. If `true` the the certificate is accepted otherwise it is\n  rejected. See\n  [\"Pinning\" a Certificate](using_public_key.md#pinning-a-certificate) in the\n  User's Guide.\n\n- **`fqdn_fun`** - This option augments the host name extraction from URIs and\n  other Reference IDs. It could for example be a very special URI that is not\n  standardised. The fun takes a Reference ID as argument and returns one of:\n\n  - the hostname\n  - the atom `default`: the default host name extract function will be used\n  - the atom `undefined`: a host name could not be extracted. The\n    pkix_verify_hostname/3 will return `false`.\n\n  For an example, see\n  [Hostname extraction](using_public_key.md#hostname_extraction) in the User's\n  Guide.","ref":"public_key.html#pkix_verify_hostname/3"},{"type":"function","title":"public_key.pkix_verify_hostname_match_fun/1","doc":"The return value of calling this function is intended to be used in the\n`match_fun` option in `pkix_verify_hostname/3`.\n\nThe returned fun augments the verify hostname matching according to the specific\nrules for the protocol in the argument.\n\n> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> Currently supported https fun will allow wildcard certificate matching as\n> specified by the HTTP standard.

Suppose a bad\nguy has succeeded with a DNS infection. Then the client could believe it is\nconnecting to one host but ends up at another but evil one. Though it is evil,\nit could have a perfectly legal certificate\\! The certificate has a valid\nsignature, it is not revoked, the certificate chain is not faked and has a\ntrusted root and so on.\n\nTo detect that the server is not the intended one, the client must additionally\nperform a _hostname verification_. This procedure is described in\n[RFC 6125](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125). The idea is that the\ncertificate lists the hostnames it could be fetched from. This is checked by the\ncertificate issuer when the certificate is signed. So if the certificate is\nissued by a trusted root the client could trust the host names signed in it.\n\nThere is a default hostname matching procedure defined in\n[RFC 6125, section 6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125#section/6) as well as\nprotocol dependent variations defined in\n[RFC 6125 appendix B](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125#appendix-B). The\ndefault procedure is implemented in\n[public_key:pkix_verify_hostname/2,3](`public_key:pkix_verify_hostname/2`). It\nis possible for a client to hook in modified rules using the options list.\n\nSome terminology is needed: the certificate presents hostname(s) on which it is\nvalid. Those are called _Presented IDs_. The hostname(s) the client believes it\nconnects to are called _Reference IDs_. The matching rules aims to verify that\nthere is at least one of the Reference IDs that matches one of the Presented\nIDs. If not, the verification fails.\n\nThe IDs contains normal fully qualified domain names like e.g `foo.example.com`,\nbut IP addresses are not recommended. The rfc describes why this is not\nrecommended as well as security considerations about how to acquire the\nReference IDs.\n\nInternationalized domain names are not supported.","ref":"using_public_key.html#background"},{"type":"extras","title":"The verification process - Examples","doc":"Traditionally the Presented IDs were found in the `Subject` certificate field as\n`CN` names. This is still quite common. When printing a certificate they show up\nas:\n\n```text\n $ openssl x509 -text < cert.pem\n ...\n Subject: C=SE, CN=example.com, CN=*.example.com, O=erlang.org\n ...\n```\n\nThe example `Subject` field has one C, two CN and one O part. It is only the CN\n(Common Name) that is used by hostname verification. The two other (C and O) is\nnot used here even when they contain a domain name like the O part. The C and O\nparts are defined elsewhere and meaningful only for other functions.\n\nIn the example the Presented IDs are `example.com` as well as hostnames matching\n`*.example.com`. For example `foo.example.com` and `bar.example.com` both\nmatches but not `foo.bar.example.com`. The name `erlang.org` matches neither\nsince it is not a CN.\n\nIn case where the Presented IDs are fetched from the `Subject` certificate\nfield, the names may contain wildcard characters. The function handles this as\ndefined in\n[chapter 6.4.3 in RFC 6125](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125#section-6.4.3).\n\nThere may only be one wildcard character and that is in the first label, for\nexample: `*.example.com`. This matches `foo.example.com` but neither\n`example.com` nor `foo.bar.example.com`.\n\nThere may be label characters before or/and after the wildcard. For example:\n`a*d.example.com` matches `abcd.example.com` and `ad.example.com`, but not\n`ab.cd.example.com`.\n\nIn the previous example there is no indication of which protocols are expected.\nSo a client has no indication of whether it is a web server, an ldap server or\nmaybe a sip server it is connected to. There are fields in the certificate that\ncan indicate this. To be more exact, the rfc introduces the usage of the\n`X509v3 Subject Alternative Name` in the `X509v3 extensions` field:\n\n```text\n $ openssl x509 -text < cert.pem\n ...\n X509v3 extensions:\n     X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:\n         DNS:kb.example.org, URI:https://www.example.org\n ...\n```\n\nHere `kb.example.org` serves any protocol while `www.example.org` presents a\nsecure web server.\n\nThe next example has both `Subject` and `Subject Alternate Name` present:\n\n```text\n $ openssl x509 -text < cert.pem\n ...\n Subject: C=SE, CN=example.com, CN=*.example.com, O=erlang.org\n ...\n X509v3 extensions:\n     X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:\n         DNS:kb.example.org, URI:https://www.example.org\n ...\n```\n\nThe RFC states that if a certificate defines Reference IDs in a\n`Subject Alternate Name` field, the `Subject` field MUST NOT be used for host\nname checking, even if it contains valid CN names. Therefore only\n`kb.example.org` and `https://www.example.org` matches. The match fails both for\n`example.com` and `foo.example.com` because they are in the `Subject` field\nwhich is not checked because the `Subject Alternate Name` field is present.\n\n[](){: #verify_hostname_examples }","ref":"using_public_key.html#the-verification-process"},{"type":"extras","title":"Function call examples - Examples","doc":"> #### Note {: .info }\n>\n> Other applications like ssl/tls or https might have options that are passed\n> down to the `public_key:pkix_verify_hostname`.

That makes it possible to have separate matching rules\nfor Presented IDs from the `Subject` field and from the `Subject Alternate Name`\nfield.\n\nThe default matching transformes the ascii values in strings to lowercase before\ncomparing.

The reason is to enable the user to do unforeseen handling of\nthe strings where the original format is needed.\n\n### \"Pinning\" a Certificate\n\nThe [RFC 6125](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125) defines _pinning_ as:\n\n> \"The act of establishing a cached name association between the application\n> service's certificate and one of the client's reference identifiers, despite\n> the fact that none of the presented identifiers matches the given reference\n> identifier. ...\"\n\nThe purpose is to have a mechanism for a human to accept an otherwise faulty\nCertificate. In for example a web browser, you could get a question like\n\n> Warning: you wanted to visit the site www.example.com, but the certificate is\n> for shop.example.com. Accept anyway (yes/no)?\"\n\nThis could be accomplished with the option `fail_callback` which will be called\nif the hostname verification fails:\n\n```erlang\n -include_lib(\"public_key/include/public_key.hrl\"). % Record def\n ...\n Fail = fun(#'OTPCertificate'{}=C) ->\n              case in_my_cache(C) orelse my_accept(C) of\n                  true ->\n                       enter_my_cache(C),\n                       true;\n                  false ->\n                       false\n         end,\n ...\n public_key:pkix_verify_hostname(CertFromHost, RefIDs,\n                                 [{fail_callback, Fail}]),\n ...\n```","ref":"using_public_key.html#extending-the-search-mechanism"}],"proglang":"erlang","content_type":"text/markdown","producer":{"name":"ex_doc","version":"0.38.1"}}
