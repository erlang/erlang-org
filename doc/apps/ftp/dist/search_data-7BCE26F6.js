This default behavior can be changed by start option\n[mode](`m:ftp#mode`).\n\nFor a simple example of an FTP session, see [FTP User's Guide](ftp_client.md).\n\nThe return values of the following functions depend much on the implementation\nof the FTP server at the remote host. In particular, the results from `ls` and\n`nlist` varies. Often real errors are not reported as errors by `ls`, even if,\nfor example, a file or directory does not exist. `nlist` is usually more strict,\nbut some implementations have the peculiar behaviour of responding with an error\nif the request is a listing of the contents of a directory that exists but is\nempty.","ref":"ftp.html"},{"type":"module","title":"Errors - ftp","doc":"The possible error reasons and the corresponding diagnostic strings returned by\n[`formaterror/1`](`formaterror/1`) are as follows:\n\n- **`echunk`** - Synchronization error during chunk sending according to one of\n  the following:\n\n  - A call is made to [`send_chunk/2`](`send_chunk/2`) or\n    [`send_chunk_end/1`](`send_chunk_end/1`) before a call to\n    [`send_chunk_start/2`](`send_chunk_start/2`).\n  - A call has been made to another transfer function during chunk sending, that\n    is, before a call to [`send_chunk_end/1`](`send_chunk_end/1`).\n\n- **`eclosed`** - The session is closed.\n\n- **`econn`** - Connection to the remote server is prematurely closed.\n\n- **`ehost`** - Host is not found, FTP server is not found, or connection is\n  rejected by FTP server.\n\n- **`elogin`** - User is not logged in.\n\n- **`enotbinary`** - Term is not a binary.\n\n- **`epath`** - No such file or directory, or directory already exists, or\n  permission denied.\n\n- **`etype`** - No such type.\n\n- **`euser`** - Invalid username or password.\n\n- **`etnospc`** - Insufficient storage space in system \\[452].\n\n- **`epnospc`** - Exceeded storage allocation (for current directory or dataset)\n  \\[552].\n\n- **`efnamena`** - Filename not allowed \\[553].","ref":"ftp.html#module-errors"},{"type":"function","title":"ftp.account/2","doc":"Sets the account for an operation, if needed.","ref":"ftp.html#account/2"},{"type":"function","title":"ftp.append/2","doc":"Equivalent to  append/3 .","ref":"ftp.html#append/2"},{"type":"function","title":"ftp.append/3","doc":"Transfers the file `LocalFile` to the remote server.

However,\n  [`byte_size/1`](`byte_size/1`) also accepts a bitstring (rounding up size to a\n  whole number of bytes), so one must make sure that the call to `byte_size/` is\n  preceded by a call to [`is_binary/1`](`is_binary/1`) to ensure that bitstrings\n  are rejected. Note that the compiler removes redundant calls to\n  [`is_binary/1`](`is_binary/1`), so if one is not sure whether previous code\n  had made sure that the argument is a binary, it does not harm to add an\n  [`is_binary/1`](`is_binary/1`) test immediately before the call to\n  [`byte_size/1`](`byte_size/1`).\n\n  Own Id: OTP-18432 Aux Id:\n  GH-6672,PR-6793,PR-6784,PR-6787,PR-6785,PR-6682,PR-6800,PR-6797,PR-6798,PR-6799,PR-6796,PR-6813,PR-6671,PR-6673,PR-6684,PR-6694,GH-6677,PR-6696,PR-6670,PR-6674","ref":"notes.html#improvements-and-new-features-3"},{"type":"extras","title":"Ftp 1.1.3 - FTP Release Notes","doc":"","ref":"notes.html#ftp-1-1-3"},{"type":"extras","title":"Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions - FTP Release Notes","doc":"- Fixes calls to `ftp:nlist/2` returning `{error, epath}` when the file / folder\n  exists\n\n  Own Id: OTP-18409 Aux Id: PR-6721,ERIERL-908","ref":"notes.html#fixed-bugs-and-malfunctions-5"},{"type":"extras","title":"Ftp 1.1.2 - FTP Release Notes","doc":"","ref":"notes.html#ftp-1-1-2"},{"type":"extras","title":"Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions - FTP Release Notes","doc":"- fix unexpected result `ok` when calling `ftp:nlist` repeatedly\n\n  Own Id: OTP-18252 Aux Id: GH-5823","ref":"notes.html#fixed-bugs-and-malfunctions-6"},{"type":"extras","title":"Ftp 1.1.1 - FTP Release Notes","doc":"","ref":"notes.html#ftp-1-1-1"},{"type":"extras","title":"Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions - FTP Release Notes","doc":"- An unexpected timeout message on the FTP control channel was observed in a\n  real system and could not be associated with anything that was expected to\n  happen, so we will ignore but info log such unexpected messages.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-17989 Aux Id: ERIERL-767","ref":"notes.html#fixed-bugs-and-malfunctions-7"},{"type":"extras","title":"Ftp 1.1 - FTP Release Notes","doc":"","ref":"notes.html#ftp-1-1"},{"type":"extras","title":"Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions - FTP Release Notes","doc":"- Use OTP supervisor as intended, avoiding surprising behavior as the killing of\n  the user's process.

Thus, they are only started\nand stopped during runtime and cannot be started at application startup. The FTP\nclient API is designed to allow some functions to return intermediate results.\nThis implies that only the process that started the FTP client can access it\nwith preserved sane semantics. If the process that started the FTP session dies,\nthe FTP client process terminates.\n\nThe client supports IPv6 as long as the underlying mechanisms also do so.","ref":"introduction.html"},{"type":"extras","title":"Examples","doc":"<!--\n%CopyrightBegin%\n\nSPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0\n\nCopyright Ericsson AB 2023-2025.

When the\nsession is opened, the current directory at the remote host is `/home/guest`,\nand `/home/fred` at the local host.
