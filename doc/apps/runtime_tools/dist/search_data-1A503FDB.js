Furthermore, the parse\ntransform module `m:ms_transform` must be enabled. The easiest way to\nenable it is by adding the following line to the source file:\n\n```\n-include_lib(\"stdlib/include/ms_transform.hrl\").\n```\n\nFailing to include `ms_transform.hrl` in the source will result in a runtime\nerror, not a compile-time error.\n\nThis function can also be invoked directly from the Erlang shell, as shown in\nthe examples that follow.\n\nThe head of the fun must be a single pattern that matches a list.

Using a trace port significantly\nlowers the overhead imposed by tracing.\n\nTwo trace drivers are currently implemented: the `file` and the `ip`\ntrace drivers.\n\nThe `file` driver sends all trace messages into one or\nseveral binary files, from where they later can be fetched and\nprocessed with the `trace_client/2` function.\n\nThe `ip` driver opens a TCP/IP port listening port. When a client\n(preferably started by calling `trace_client/2` on another Erlang\nnode) connects, all trace messages are sent over the IP network for\nfurther processing by the remote client.\n\nThe `file` trace driver expects a filename or a wrap files\nspecification as parameter. A file is written with a high degree of\nbuffering, which is why there is no guarantee that all are saved in the\nfile in case of a system crash.\n\nA wrap files specification is used to limit the disk space consumed by the\ntrace. The trace is written to a limited number of files each with a limited\nsize. The actual filenames are `Filename ++ SeqCnt ++ Suffix`, where `SeqCnt`\ncounts as a decimal string from `0` to `WrapCnt` and then around again from `0`.\nWhen a trace term written to the current file makes it longer than `WrapSize`,\nthat file is closed, and if the number of files in this wrap trace is as many as\n`WrapCnt` the oldest file is deleted, and a new file is opened to become the\ncurrent. Thus, when a wrap trace has been stopped, there are at most `WrapCnt`\ntrace files saved with a size of at least `WrapSize` (but not much larger),\nexcept for the last file that might even be empty. The default values are\n`WrapSize = 128*1024` and `WrapCnt = 8`.\n\nThe `SeqCnt` values in the filenames are all in the range `0` through `WrapCnt`\nwith a gap in the circular sequence. The gap is needed to find the end of the\ntrace.\n\nIf the `WrapSize` is specified as `{time, WrapTime}`, the current file is closed\nwhen it has been open more than `WrapTime` milliseconds, regardless of it being\nempty or not.\n\nThe `ip` trace driver has a queue of `QueSize` messages waiting to be delivered.\nIf the driver cannot deliver messages as fast as they are produced by the\nruntime system, a special message is sent, which indicates how many messages\nthat are dropped. That message will arrive at the handler function specified in\n`trace_client/3` as the tuple `{drop, N}` where `N` is the number of consecutive\nmessages dropped. In case of heavy tracing, drops are likely to occur, and they\nsurely occur if no client is reading the trace messages.

This\n  is the average amount of time the schedulers did not sleep.\n\nThen one column per state is printed with a the percentage of time this thread\nspent in the state out of it's own real-time. After the thread specific time,\nthe accumulated time for each type of thread is printed in a similar format.\n\nSince we have the average real-time and the percentage spent in each state we\ncan easily calculate the time spent in each state by multiplying\n`Average thread real-time` with `Thread state %`, that is, to get the time Scheduler\n1 spent in the emulator state we do `1000513us * 0.13% = 1300us`.","ref":"msacc.html"},{"type":"function","title":"msacc.available/0","doc":"This function checks whether microstate accounting is available or not.","ref":"msacc.html#available/0"},{"type":"function","title":"msacc.from_file/1","doc":"Read a file dump produced by [to_file(Filename)](`to_file/1`).","ref":"msacc.html#from_file/1"},{"type":"type","title":"msacc.msacc_data/0","doc":"","ref":"msacc.html#t:msacc_data/0"},{"type":"type","title":"msacc.msacc_data_counters/0","doc":"A map containing the different microstate accounting states and the number of\nmicroseconds spent in it.","ref":"msacc.html#t:msacc_data_counters/0"},{"type":"type","title":"msacc.msacc_data_thread/0","doc":"","ref":"msacc.html#t:msacc_data_thread/0"},{"type":"type","title":"msacc.msacc_id/0","doc":"","ref":"msacc.html#t:msacc_id/0"},{"type":"type","title":"msacc.msacc_print_options/0","doc":"The different options that can be given to `print/2`.","ref":"msacc.html#t:msacc_print_options/0"},{"type":"type","title":"msacc.msacc_state/0","doc":"The different states that a thread can be in.

As a side effect, nominal types can encode opaque types. We changed all opaque-handling logic and improved opaque warnings in Dialyzer.\n  \n  All existing Erlang type systems are structural: two types are seen as equivalent if their structures are the same. Type comparisons are based on the structures of the types, not on how the user explicitly defines them. For example, in the following example, `meter()` and `foot()` are equivalent. The two types can be used interchangeably. Neither of them differ from the basic type `integer()`.\n  \n  ````\n  -type meter() :: integer().\n  -type foot() :: integer().\n  ````\n  \n  Nominal typing is an alternative type system, where two types are equivalent if and only if they are declared with the same type name. The EEP proposes one new syntax -nominal for declaring nominal types. Under nominal typing, `meter()` and `foot()` are no longer compatible. Whenever a function expects type `meter()`, passing in type `foot()` would result in a Dialyzer error.\n  \n  ````\n  -nominal meter() :: integer().\n  -nominal foot() :: integer().\n  ````\n  \n  More nominal type-checking rules can be found in the EEP. It is worth noting that most work for adding nominal types and type-checking is in `erl_types.erl`. The rest are changes that removed the previous opaque type-checking, and added an improved version of it using nominal type-checking with reworked warnings.\n  \n  Backwards compatibility for opaque type-checking is not preserved by this PR. Previous opaque warnings can appear with slightly different wordings. A new kind of opaque warning `opaque_union` is added, together with a Dialyzer option `no_opaque_union` to turn this kind of warnings off.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-19364 Aux Id: [PR-9079]\n\n- When compiling C/C++ code on Unix systems, the compiler hardening flags suggested by the [Open Source Security Foundation](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/docs/Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C%2B%2B.md) are now enabled by default.

The overload mechanism can now also react to incoming messages.\n  This is useful if an external overload watch-dog is used. Some improvements of\n  variable bindings has been done to the default autostart mechanism -\n  inviso_autostart_server. Autostart \"jobs\" can now be done in parallel,\n  allowing for some jobs to hang waiting for some parts of the traced system to\n  become ready before proceeding. Previously when using named meta-match-specs\n  (tpm_ms) ending up with zero match-specs still kept the meta trace pattern\n  active. This caused zero match-specs to be equal to unlimited meta tracing on\n  that particular function. If the internal database becomes empty of meta match\n  specs, meta trace pattern is removed for that function. Standard public loop\n  data in the inviso runtime meta tracer process is now extended to a 2-tuple.\n  The functions ctp/1 and ctpl/1 are added making it possible to remove trace\n  patterns for a list of functions rather than one by one. Inviso_rt_meta will\n  now accept a list of binaries to be output into the trace information file, in\n  additions to a single binary. Further it is also possible to make own output\n  to the trace information file using the write_ti/1 function. An error was\n  discovered in inviso_rt making the inviso_rt_meta remain rather than terminate\n  if the inviso_rt terminated due to \"running alone\" (not allowed to run without\n  a control component). A new tool, inviso_tool, has been added to the inviso\n  application.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-6426","ref":"notes.html#fixed-bugs-and-malfunctions-33"},{"type":"extras","title":"Runtime_Tools 1.6.2 - Runtime_Tools Release Notes","doc":"","ref":"notes.html#runtime_tools-1-6-2"},{"type":"extras","title":"Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions - Runtime_Tools Release Notes","doc":"- Several minor bugs and race conditions eliminated in the runtime_tools and\n  observer applications.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-6265","ref":"notes.html#fixed-bugs-and-malfunctions-34"},{"type":"extras","title":"Runtime_Tools 1.6.1 - Runtime_Tools Release Notes","doc":"","ref":"notes.html#runtime_tools-1-6-1"},{"type":"extras","title":"Improvements and New Features - Runtime_Tools Release Notes","doc":"- There are new BIFs `erlang:spawn_monitor/1,3`, and the new option `monitor`\n  for `spawn_opt/2,3,4,5`.\n\n  The `observer_backend` module has been updated to handle the new BIFs.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-6281","ref":"notes.html#improvements-and-new-features-42"},{"type":"extras","title":"Runtime_Tools 1.6 - Runtime_Tools Release Notes","doc":"Added the runtime part of the Inviso tracer, see the new Inviso application for\nmore information.

This will happen if a group leader process generates\na trace message and the tracer process, by calling the trace handler function,\nsends an I/O request to the same group leader. The problem can only occur if the\ntrace handler prints to the tty using an `m:io` function such as\n[`format/2`](`io:format/2`). Note that when `dbg:p(all, call)` is called, IO\nprocesses are also traced. Here is an example:\n\n```erlang\n%% Using a default line editing shell\n1> dbg:tracer(process, {fun(Msg,_) -> io:format(\"~p~n\", [Msg]), 0 end, 0}).\n{ok,<0.37.0>}\n2> dbg:p(all, [call]).\n{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,25}]}\n3> dbg:tp(mymod,[{'_',[],[]}]).\n{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,0},{saved,1}]}\n4> mymod: % TAB pressed here\n%% -- Deadlock --\n```\n\nHere is another example:\n\n```erlang\n%% Using a shell without line editing (oldshell)\n1> dbg:tracer(process).\n{ok,<0.31.0>}\n2> dbg:p(all, [call]).\n{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,25}]}\n3> dbg:tp(lists,[{'_',[],[]}]).\n{ok,[{matched,nonode@nohost,0},{saved,1}]}\n% -- Deadlock --\n```\n\nThe reason we get a deadlock in the first example is because when TAB is pressed\nto expand the function name, the group leader (which handles character input)\ncalls `mymod:module_info()`. This generates a trace message which, in turn,\ncauses the tracer process to send an IO request to the group leader (by calling\n`io:format/2`). We end up in a deadlock.\n\nIn the second example we use the default trace handler function. This\nhandler prints to the tty by sending IO requests to the `user`\nprocess. When Erlang is started in the oldshell mode, the shell\nprocess will have `user` as its group leader and so will the tracer\nprocess in this example. Since `user` calls functions in `lists` we\nend up in a deadlock as soon as the first IO request is sent.\n\nHere are a few suggestions for avoiding deadlock:\n\n- Do not trace the group leader of the tracer process. If tracing has been\n  switched on for all processes, call `dbg:p(TracerGLPid, clear)` to stop tracing\n  the group leader (`TracerGLPid`).\n  [`process_info(TracerPid, group_leader)`](`process_info/2`) tells you which\n  process this is (`TracerPid` is returned from `dbg:get_tracer/0`).\n- Do not trace the `user` process if using the default trace handler function.\n- In your own trace handler function, call `erlang:display/1` instead of an `io`\n  function or, if `user` is not used as group leader, print to `user` instead of\n  the default group leader. Example: `io:format(user, Str, Args)`.\n\n[](){: #help }","ref":"dbg_guide.html#avoiding-deadlocks"},{"type":"extras","title":"Getting Information and Help - Tracing in Erlang with dbg","doc":"* **[`dbg:i()` (Information)](`dbg:i/0`):** Displays information about all currently traced processes and ports and their active trace flags.\n  * **[`dbg:h()` (Help)](`dbg:h/0`):** Lists available help items.\n  * **[`dbg:h(Item :: atom())`](`dbg:h/1`):** Gives brief help for a specific `dbg` function or concept (e.g., `dbg:h(tp)`).\n  * **[`dbg:get_tracer()`](`dbg:get_tracer/0`) / \n  [`dbg:get_tracer(Node)`](`dbg:get_tracer/1`):** Returns the process, port, or tracer module handling traces on the local/specified node.\n  * Consult the [dbg module documentation](`m:dbg`).","ref":"dbg_guide.html#getting-information-and-help"}],"proglang":"erlang","content_type":"text/markdown","producer":{"name":"ex_doc","version":"0.38.1"}}
