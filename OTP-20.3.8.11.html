        release_note: "ERTS internal trees of monitor structures could get into an inconsistent state. This could cause 'DOWN' messages not to be delivered when they should, as well as delivery of 'DOWN' messages that should not be delivered.\n\nThis bug was introduced in ERTS version 9.0 (OTP 20.0) and was fixed in ERTS version 10.0 (OTP 21.0) due to a rewrite of the monitor code. That is, this bug only exist in the OTP 20 release.\n\n"
