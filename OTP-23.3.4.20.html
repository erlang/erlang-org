        release_note: "With this change (being response to CVE-2023-48795), ssh can negotiate \"strict KEX\" OpenSSH extension with peers supporting it; also 'chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com' algorithm becomes a less preferred cipher.\n\nIf strict KEX availability cannot be ensured on both connection sides, affected encryption modes(CHACHA and CBC) can be disabled with standard ssh configuration. This will provide protection against vulnerability, but at a cost of affecting interoperability. See Configuring algorithms in SSH User's Guide.\n\n"
