      OTP-13397:
        release_note: "Add support for Erlang Distribution protocol to split the payload of large signals into several fragments. This allows other processes to communicate uninterrupted during the transmission of these signals.\n\n"
        Applications: "erts"
      OTP-14831:
        release_note: "A simple socket API is provided through the socket module. This is a low level API that does *not* replace gen_[tcp|udp|sctp]. It is intended to *eventually* replace the inet driver, but not the high level gen-modules (gen_tcp, gen_udp and gen_sctp). It also provides a basic API that facilitates the implementation of other protocols, that is TCP, UDP and SCTP.\n\nKnown issues are; No support for the Windows OS (currently).\n\n"
        Applications: "erts, kernel"
      OTP-14894:
        release_note: "The compiler has been rewritten to internally use an intermediate representation based on Static Single Assignment (SSA). The new intermediate representation makes more optimizations possible.\n\nMost noticeable is that the binary matching optimizations are now applicable in many more circumstances than before.\n\nAnother noticeable change is that type optimizations are now applied across local function calls, and will remove a lot more redundant type tests than before.\n\n"
        Applications: "compiler"
        RelatedIds: "ERL-714"
      OTP-15055:
        release_note: "Use new logger API in ssl. Introduce log levels and verbose debug logging for SSL.\n\n"
        Applications: "ssl"
      OTP-15128:
        release_note: "ETS option write_concurrency now also affects and improves the scalability of ordered_set tables. The implementation is based on a data structure called contention adapting search tree, where the lock granularity adapts to the actual amount of concurrency exploited by the applications in runtime.\n\n"
        Applications: "erts, stdlib"
      OTP-15439:
        release_note: "The length/1 BIF used to calculate the length of the list in one go without yielding, even if the list was very long. In OTP 22, length/1 will yield when called with long lists.\n\n"
        Applications: "erts"
      OTP-15456:
        release_note: "All compiler options that can be given in the source file can now also be given in the option list or from the command line for erlc.\n\nSpecifically, the option {nowarn_deprecated_function,MFAs} was only recognized when given in the file with the attribute -compile(). The option {nowarn_unused_function,FAs} was incorrectly documented to only work in a file, but it also worked when given in the option list.\n\n"
        Applications: "compiler"
      OTP-15483:

        RelatedIds: "ERL-924"
      OTP-15575:
        release_note: "The cover tool now uses the counters module instead of ets for updating the counters for how many times a line has been executed. By default, Cover will work with distributed nodes, but a new function cover:local_only/0 allows running the Cover in a restricted but faster local-only mode.\n\nThe increase in speed will vary depending on the type of code being cover-compiled, but as an example, the compiler test suite runs more than twice as fast with the new Cover.\n\n"
        Applications: "tools"
      OTP-15591:
        release_note: "Basic support for TLS 1.3 Server for experimental use. The client is not yet functional, for more information see the Standards Compliance chapter of the User's Guide.\n\n"
        Applications: "ssl"
      OTP-15596:
        release_note: "In OTP 22, HiPE (the native code compiler) is not fully functional. The reasons for this are:\n\nThere are new BEAM instructions for binary matching that the HiPE native code compiler does not support.\n\nThe new optimizations in the Erlang compiler create new combination of instructions that HiPE currently does not handle correctly.\n\nIf erlc is invoked with the +native option, and if any of the new binary matching instructions are used, the compiler will issue a warning and produce a BEAM file without native code.\n\n"
        Applications: "erts, hipe, otp"
      OTP-15640:
        release_note: "Added the NIF function enif_term_type, which helps avoid long sequences of enif_is_xyz by returning the type of the given term. This is especially helpful for NIFs that serialize terms, such as JSON encoders, where it can improve both performance and readability.\n\n"

These counters can cause scalability problems (especially on big NUMA systems). This change adds an implementation of a decentralized counter and modifies the implementation of ETS so that ETS tables of type ordered_set with write_concurrency enabled use the decentralized counter.
