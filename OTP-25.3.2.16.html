There where two problems, firstly the peer cert extension was only checked if it was marked critical, and secondly the CA cert check did not assert the relaxed AnyExtendedKeyUsage purpose.\n\nThis could result in that certificates might be misused for purposes not intended by the certificate authority.\n\nThanks to Bryan Paxton for reporting the issue.\n\n"
